Council Member Scharff asked if the City had an ARC for pension liability.

Mr. Rossmann answered yes, in the amount of $239 million.

Council Member Scharff asked if Staff had a plan for funding the pension
liability.

Mr. Rossmann advised the only plan was to pay the ARC. Staff would
explore options with the Finance Committee at the direction of the Council.
The City could fully pay the ARC every year; utilize Budget surpluses to
reduce the unfunded liability; or reduce the number of active employees.

Council Member Scharff inquired about the decrease in FY 2017.

Mr. Rossmann reported that would result from a decrease in the Telephone
Tax rate and decreased water and gas consumption. Staff expected lower
gas and water consumption would continue.

Council Member Scharff asked what would cause the increase the following
year.

Mr. Rossmann indicated other tax revenues would increase.

Mr. Keene noted the Council would review unfunded liabilities each year for
the next ten years.

Council Member Filseth remarked that the size of the surplus was sensitive
to the assumption of the California Public Employees' Retirement System
(CalPERS) interest rate returns. The Finance Committee should discuss that
in-depth.    He inquired whether the additional transfer of $4.7 million
annually to the Capital Fund was the debt service cost.

Mr. Rossmann advised that the annual debt service cost for the
Infrastructure Funding Plan was $4.7 million for 30 years. The City had not
issued any debt but was collecting the tax; therefore, Staff proposed using
those funds to fill the funding gap.

Council Member Filseth asked if the interest rate was approximately 3 3/4
percent.

Mr. Saccio indicated the $4.7 million would support approximately $70
million in debt.

Council Member Filseth requested the anticipated interest rate.
