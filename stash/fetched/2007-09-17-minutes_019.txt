approach in the RFP for new collection services with the possible exception
of the relocation of the Recycling Center as well as the Hazardous Facility
and to remove any size reference of the program.

Mayor Kishimoto said a timeline is not being set tonight by asking staff to
come back with recommendations of what is feasible. Regarding the regional
facilities for the recycling and household hazardous waste, justification for
the 2.2 acres needs to be made.

Mr. Roberts replied removing a reference to a specific size of any particular

Council Member Drekmeier stated the Plan is an amazing document and
when covering this much material can be very challenging. However, this is

Vice Mayor Klein said he thinks his motion differs in a variety of ways from
the staff recommendation. He stated he believes the Council needs to go
through the plan item by item. Either the Plan is approved or not. If you
