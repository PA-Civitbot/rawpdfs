Mr. Kott asked Council Member Freeman what she meant by an unintended
impact.

Council Member Freeman said she was referring to unanticipated issues that
could occur in the future such as traffic stack up.

Mr. Kott said the traffic forecast model was predicated on future traffic
growth. Sufficient stacking room would be provided for vehicles approaching
intersections and waiting for lights to change. The trial plan would include
observing traffic dynamics and to determine sufficient stacking space. There
would be moveable workshops along the corridor during the trial period
where residents could be on the scene to observe and collect input during
real time.

Mayor Burch supported the motion.

return to the Planning and Transportation Commission (P&TC) to reconsider
exclusion of carports completely opened on three or more sides from gross
floor area calculation of a single family home. Prior to adopting the ZOU for
R1 in May 2005, garages and carports, whether enclosed or not, were
considered as floor area of a single family home. The revised code excluded
carports opened on three or more sides. The P&TCâ€™s recommendation
limited the exclusion for carports completely opened on three or more sides

recommendation was to eliminate the gross floor area exclusion for carports
