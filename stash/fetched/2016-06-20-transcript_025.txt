Vice Mayor Scharff: That'll go on Consent; we'll have said we did it. What's
the amount of that, the feasibility alternatives? How much money are we
tentatively committing to spend if we did that?

Mr. Mello: I would say probably roughly $1 million. The estimate that's
shown on the cost estimate slide includes an environmental and alternatives
analysis. If we were to break that apart, each phase would probably be
roughly $1 million.

Vice Mayor Scharff: When do you think we would actually institute that?
Would it be 2018 or 2019 or next year, 2017?

Mr. Mello: A typical study with that scope would be a year and a half.
Probably a year, year and a half, I think we could come back with an
alternatives analysis.

Vice Mayor Scharff: You think it would take a year or a year and a half to do
the study.

Mr. Mello: Yes.

Vice Mayor Scharff: How long would itâ€”when will we start it? When would
we have the money to start it? Have we looked at a budget? How are we
going to fund this?

Mr. Mello:    We can look at funding it through the Bike Ped Plan
implementation, if Council wants to move forward with these three projects
that we're recommending. Again, we'd probably have to come back to you
with more firm details on what the contract costs would be for each of these
three.

Vice Mayor Scharff: Thank you.

Mayor Burt: Council Member Wolbach.

Council Member Wolbach: I just want to get a sense of some distances
here. Loma Verde at Bayshore is only about half a mile, about 0.5 mile,
from our future bike and pedestrian bridge at Adobe Creek. Is that correct?

Mr. Mello: The Adobe Creek overcrossing?
