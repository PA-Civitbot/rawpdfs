Council Member Holman asked if the item would be going back to the Finance
Committee or to the full Council.

Mr. Keene stated the item had been to the Utilities Advisory Commission (UAC)
and placed on the Consent Calendar. Staff pulled the Agenda Item and
recommended that it be brought back to the Council.

Mayor Espinosa stated Agenda Item No. 9 became Agenda Item No. 16a.

Tim Lynch spoke regarding Agenda Item No. 7. He stated a contractor was
accepting dirt at the landfill site and that dirt less than 500 cubic yards did not
have to be analyzed prior to its disposal. He said 90 percent of the dirt he
needed to get rid of came from small residential jobs in Palo Alto. He raised
concerns that private contractors would take control of the type of dirt being
accepted and asked the Council to allow the landfill to accept the alluvial soil
he needed to get rid of.

MOTION: Council Member Klein moved, seconded by Council Member Scharff
to approve Agenda Item Nos. 7-8, 10-15.

Mayor Espinosa restated that Agenda Item No. 9 would become Agenda Item
No. 16a. Agenda Item No. 16 has been moved to a date uncertain.
