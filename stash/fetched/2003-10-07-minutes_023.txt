Council Member Freeman said Item No. 13 was also time sensitive in order
to get on a Policy and Services Committee calendar and a Resolution by
January. The item needed to be vetted now or at the next meeting at a time
certain.

Mayor Mossar said she did not know how full the agenda was for the
following week.

Council Member Freeman requested discussing Item No. 13.

Mayor Mossar suggested no action be taken on Item Nos. 12, 13, and 14
and withdrew her comments on time sensitivity for Item No. 12.

conflicting roles in her employment with the City of San Jose.

MOTION: Council Member Morton moved, seconded by Ojakian, to join
other cities by asking the Mayor to send a letter to the Valley Transportation
Authority (VTA) in support of requesting the VTA Board of Directors to

balanced individual city representation and meaningful participation for
small- and medium-sized cities in the County.

MOTION PASSED 8-0, Lytle “not participating.”
