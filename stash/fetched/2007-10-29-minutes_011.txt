Council Member Morton asked regarding recommendation number four,
which encouraged the new service provider to retain the PASCO employees
and current pay levels. He asked whether that would become a condition of
the contract.

Mr. Roberts stated he was correct.

Council Member Morton stated that he supported local recycling and
composting and the issues regarding timing would need to be worked out
with long term possibilities and the location. There would be short-term
issues when the current site was moved closer to the wastewater site.

Mr. Roberts stated that was an issue that staff was working on and
alternatives for the location of the recycling center and it will return to the
Council.

Council Member Morton stated he would be interested in exploring extending
the recreation uses of the Geng Road site. He added that with
recommendation number nine the option for separate processing and
collection was reserved. He asked whether processing would be hauling.

Mr. Roberts stated processing was not the same as hauling.

Council Member Morton asked whether that was local processing or an
alternative to the SMaRT Station.

Mr. Roberts stated processing was the offsite use of regional facilities to
process and ship recycling, and where the food waste went to be processed.

Council Member Morton asked whether hauling was considered pickup verses
what happens after it was picked up.

Mr. Roberts stated he was correct.

Council Member Morton asked why there was a reserve option for
recommendation number nine and not on recommendation ten.

Mr. Roberts stated it was strongly urged to have one contractor to be able to
manage their schedule, routes, pickup time and have no competition to
provide that service.

Council Member Morton asked regarding recommendation number eight for
the C&D processing whether we could encourage the SMaRT Station to
increase the 25 percent recovery rate.
