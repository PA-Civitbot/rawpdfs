CONSENT CALENDAR

Kutzmann and Associates occasionally provided plan check reviews of his
professional work.

Council Member Kleinberg stated she would not participate on Item 4
because she wanted to avoid any suggestion of conflict since the scope of
work called out the maximizing and leveraging of applications, which are
part of the proprietary intellectual property of Google and her organization
