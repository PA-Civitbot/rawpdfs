Elizabeth Wong, 1849 Webster Street, was in support of Mr. Yen’s proposal,
which had been approved by the City three times and she asked the Council
to approve the project.

Pete Moffat, 1518 Hamilton Avenue, said involved neighbors worked with Mr.
Yen to redesign the project to meet their concerns and were happy with the

Nancy Staggs, 1526 Hamilton Avenue, was in support of the Yen’s proposal.

Justin Wang, 3480 Thomas Drive, said the Yens had followed all the rules,
made changes to accommodate neighbors, and he was puzzled by Mr.

concerns directly to the Yens. He urged the Council to approve the Yen’s
project.

Consent Calendar.

Richard Cook, 681 Rhodes Drive, asked the item remain on the Consent
Calendar.

Ronni Kerrins, 3280 Clifton Court, asked the item be left on the Consent
Calendar and be approved.

Bret Kerrins, 3280 Clifton Court, echoed Ronni Kerrins’ request.
