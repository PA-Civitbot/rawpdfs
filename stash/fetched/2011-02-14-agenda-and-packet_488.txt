Step 2 - Amount of Hg Diverted

In its 2008 evaluation of waste mercury sources, the RWQCP estimated that
dental practices in the service area have successfully diverted 5.1 kg/yr of this




                                                                                                        Attachment: PA Comments EPA HQ-OAR-2009-0559_Final (1297 : EPA Proposed Rule on Sewage Sludge Incinerators)
metal from the sewer system. This diversion is equivalent to 0.0056 tons per
year.


Step 3 - Cost to Purchase & Install A Separator

In 2008 US EPA published a comparative study of amalgam separators,
including their effectiveness and costs (See EPA-821-R-08-014). Data from
Table 5-4 of the EPA report are used here, together with information on
installation costs from local sources.

       $112        Annualized Cost to Purchase & Install a Separator




Step 4 - Annual Maintenance Costs

Local dental practices indicate that they service their amalgam separators once
every 12 to 18 months, with the frequency depending upon the number of
practitioners served by the unit and the amount of work that these dentists do.

The following table presents estimated total costs for separators that are serviced
once per year. This annual total includes: equipment amortization for 10 years;
typical annual maintenance costs of about $600; and 1/8th of a FTE for RWQCP
staff to conduct on-going inspections. Costs for maintaining the Solmetex Hg5
amalgam separator are used here because this unit is the most common in the
service area.
