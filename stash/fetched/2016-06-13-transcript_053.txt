Mr. de Geus: We just want to be sure that the—the hope is that the
emerging needs fund would be available to existing groups that have got
grants from the HSRAP program in addition to maybe additional nonprofits,
depending on the emerging need, that may not be current grantees.

Vice Mayor Scharff: Shouldn't we say "emerging needs funds for HSRAP"?
For HSRAP grantees, would that be ...

Mr. de Geus: I think "for HSRAP" is better. HSRAP grantees.

Mayor Burt: I'm sorry. Can I ask a clarifying question? Would that include
programs that aren't currently part of HSRAP, though?

Mr. Keene: Correct. (crosstalk) In that sense, I think it includes Council
Member Wolbach's suggestion about Human Services. It could be a human
service need that is not funded through an existing HSRAP grantee, that
could be funded through the emerging needs.

Mayor Burt: I'm trying to align with the wording of the motion, because it
says "emerging needs funds for HSRAP." That sounds more restrictive.

Council Member Wolbach: That was the point of my question. Should we
broaden HSRAP to be Human Services nonprofits? Would that allow greater
flexibility?

Mr. de Geus: I think so. We could expand that.

Vice Mayor Scharff: Why don't we just say that, "human resources"?

Council Member Wolbach: Let's change it to "Human Services nonprofits."

Vice Mayor Scharff: That's fine. If you're fine with it?

Mr. de Geus: As long it does include the HSRAP grantees as well. It's both.

Mayor Burt:   Why don't we—if it's okay, we'll say for Human Services ...

Council Member Wolbach: Programs.

Mayor Burt: ... including HSRAP.

Vice Mayor Scharff: Including HSRAP grantees.

Mayor Burt: Yeah, grantees.
