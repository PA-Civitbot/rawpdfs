Council Member Wolbach: That's why I'm highlighting it at the level of being
part of the Comprehensive Plan. It is something that we have not done well
in the past. It's going to take a substantial amount of work to figure out
how to do it well and more efficiently.

Mayor Holman: That's not what the Comprehensive Plan is scheduled to do.

Council Member Wolbach: Do you have a suggested amendment?

Mayor Holman: Yeah. I'm not. Just take out the word "regular," I think

Mr. Dennis: Mayor Holman?

Mayor Holman: Yes.

Male: "Become a utilized planning tool."

Council Member Burt: We use them some. I think it's ...

Mayor Holman: We haven't in many years.

Council Member Burt: ... increase frequency. How about if we just simply

Mayor Holman: Is that agreeable to you, Council Member Wolbach?

Council Member Wolbach: That is agreeable to me.

Mayor Holman: "More frequently used," that's accepted.
