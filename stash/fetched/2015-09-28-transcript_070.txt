Council Member DuBois: You said the revised wireless report. Can we tie it
to the ...

Council Member Scharff: Let's just tie it to the goals.

Council Member DuBois: ... revision of the fiber ...

Council Member Scharff:     Right, when we do the fiber goals.     That's fine.
I'm good either way.

Council Member Burt: Let's give them clear language then.

Mayor Holman: Yes.

Council Member Scharff: Will be revisited when we look at the fiber goals in
the first quarter of 2016.

Mayor Holman: When Council reviews the fiber goals ...

Council Member Scharff: In the first quarter of 2016.

Mayor Holman:     ... in the first quarter of 2016.    Okay.   Council Member
DuBois?

Council Member DuBois: Yes.

Mayor Holman: Council Member Burt, I see you nodding your head.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to add to the Motion at the end of Part D, “but will
be revisited when Council reviews Fiber Goals in the first quarter of 2016.”

Mayor Holman: Anything else, Council Member Scharff?

Council Member Scharff: Yes. When we issue the RFP, which is what Staff
wanted to do, Staff also had in there with options to expand Wi-Fi coverage
at City facilities and public areas. We have in retail areas, but I don't think
we're issuing the RFP to do the retail areas and the other public areas with
options for that. I think we should add that in just like it was in the Staff
