Mayor Holman: It's the final ...

Council Member Scharff: The one below Figure 2.1.

Mayor Holman: It's the final "B" on that page.

Council Member Scharff: Yeah, that's fine.

Council Member Burt: Thank you.

Mayor Holman: And Berman? Okay.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to add to the Motion, “request that the ARB
reconsider the project in its entirety as it complies with Context and
Architectural Review Findings, specifically Municipal Code Sections:

A.    18.76.020 Architectural Review (d)(4); and

B.    18.76.020 Architectural Review (d)(12); and

C.    18.18.110 Context Based Design Criteria (a)(1)(B); and

D.    18.18.110 Context Based Design Criteria (a)(2)(B)(i); and

E.    18.18.110 Context Based Design Criteria (a)(2)(B)(iii); and

F.    18.18.110 Context Based Design Criteria (b)(2)(B).”

Mayor Holman: I think—Council Member Kniss.

Council Member Kniss: A couple of things. I will support the motion. I
think we're getting pretty complicated, though, and here is the reason. We
are between a rock and a hard place on compatibility. Compatibility is very
difficult to define. Eric mentioned it earlier; we are subjective or we're
objective. We're becoming very subjective. My request on this would be—
Greg, if you're okay with this—I want a full ARB, at least four members to be
there. If we have another situation where only three were there, there's not
a quorum. I don't think we end up with anything more worthwhile than
what we've gotten tonight. I don't know how soon that will happen, that
this will be a full complement. I have no idea. That would be my request, it
doesn't go back to the ARB without having a quorum.

Council Member Scharff: I did have a question. Why did ...

Council Member Kniss: They said there were three, and it wasn't a quorum.
