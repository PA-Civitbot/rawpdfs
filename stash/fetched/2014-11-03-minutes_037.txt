Council Member Holman inquired about the timing of returning the item to
the Finance Committee and then the Council.

Mr. Perez would attempt to present it at the December 16 meeting.

Mr. Keene could not make a commitment with respect to a timeline.

Vice Mayor Kniss stated the item should not have been presented to the
Council. She wanted the item to return quickly to prevent continued loss of
revenue and requested the item be presented to the Finance Committee at
its next meeting.

Mayor Shepherd noted $22,000 of the fees collected through 2023 could
support public safety needs. She wanted to understand if the Infrastructure
Funding Plan included revenues from the fees.

Mr. Keene would present the item as soon as possible. Staff could respond
to the Infrastructure Funding Plan component of the Motion more easily than
the methodological component. Staff would consider bifurcating the two
components.

MOTION PASSED: 9-0

13.   Approval of Fiscal Year 2014 Reappropriation Requests for the
      Municipal Services Center to be Carried Forward Into Fiscal Year 2015.

James Keene, City Manager, recommended the Council reject the
reappropriation requests and allow funding to return to the Infrastructure
Reserve. In the 2016 Budget, the Council could discuss the scope of the
project and appropriate funds.

MOTION: Council Member Scharff moved, seconded by Council Member
Holman to remove this from the reappropriations and bring it back by the
2016 budget.

Council Member Berman felt the City was overdue for a study of the
Municipal Services Center. The item did not pertain to or endanger the
Animal Services Center.

Mr. Keene clarified that Staff could return with a Budget Amendment in
Fiscal Year 2015 as an appropriation from the Infrastructure Reserve if the
Council wished.
