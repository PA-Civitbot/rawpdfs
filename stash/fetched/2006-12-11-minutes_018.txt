AMENDMENT: Council Member Drekmeier moved that the City commit
$10,000 to the eradication of invasive plants at the Baylands.

AMENDMENT FAILED FOR LACK OF A SECOND

Council Member Beecham stated if there were appropriate budget funds
available to support the motion that would be fine.

Mayor Kleinberg suggested leaving the motion as stated.

Vice Mayor Kishimoto stated her support for the motion.

Council Member Morton stated he did not support discussion with the County
or with the treatment plant possibly taking a few years to make a decision.
Could the PASCO site possibly be a potential site.

Mr. Benest stated the PASCO site was not large enough to meet the Honda
Corporate criteria.

Council Member Mossar asked Mr. Benest to comment on the other available
privately-held location.

Mr. Benest stated the cost for leasing private land was too great.

Council Member Mossar asked if it were possible to consider redevelopment
of a desired private location for the use of retaining the dealership.

Mr. Benest stated the City was not currently able to establish redevelopment
area in the City.

Vice Mayor Kishimoto inquired on the potential of transfer development
instead of redevelopment.

Director of Planning and Community Environment Steve Emslie stated
transfer development was not usable in that scenario.

Vice Mayor Kishimoto asked staff and the Planning and Transportation
Commission to explore the Transfer Development Rights (TDR) process.

Mr. Benest stated staff would explore any idea that assisted in retaining
Anderson Honda in the City of Palo Alto.

Mayor Kleinberg asked whether the Palo Alto Harbor had potential for the
Anderson Honda site and if it was available.

Mr. Benest stated he was unaware of the availability of the Palo Alto Harbor.
