Ms. Nagel stated the City had costs with staff implementation but the
benefits pertain to the members of the community. She directed him to the
URS Corporation (USR) report, where there are total cost benefits and a list
of stakeholders whose costs and benefits are included in the calculation.

Council Member Barton asked was it fair to subtract these amounts for the
total savings.

Ms. Nagel stated this is not the case, the community includes the City.

Council Member Barton asked about the discrepancy between the slide
recommendations and recommendations in the City Manager’s Report, and if
a cash flow needs assessment would be done before implementation.

Ms. Nagel stated the implementation should be started and the first step
would be the cash flow needs assessment.

Council Member Barton noted the steps were in the appropriate order.

Vice Mayor Drekmeier asked whether the Calaveras Fund could be used for
LED lighting on this project.

Ms. Nagel stated they would be brainstorming with the Administrative
Services Department.

Director of Utilities, Valerie Fong stated they would have to be careful
between the General Fund and Enterprise Funds.

Vice Mayor Drekmeier asked what the 30-40 dollars per ton costs entailed.

Ms. Nagel stated it is either for marketing or costs of power.

City Manager, Frank Benest asked if they were talking about the City
purchasing more of its own electricity.

Vice Mayor Drekmeier stated he was asking for the community’s needs.

Mr. Benest asked if they meant subsidizing the community’s use of Palo Alto
Green.

Vice Mayor Drekmeier stated he thought it was probably 30-40 dollars per
ton to market the project to get more people to buy in. He asked if it would
be legal to have an opt-out program for Palo Alto Green to cut marketing
costs.
