________________________________________________________________

Introduction & Contents
This handbook describes the way the Palo Alto City Council does its business. It is
intended to accomplish two goals. First, the handbook is an information guide for
anyone doing business or appearing before the City Council. Second, the handbook is a
compilation of procedural rules that have been formally adopted by Council Resolution.

The handbook is organized in five sections.

   Public Participation in Council Meetings

       This section explains the basic rules for speaking to the City Council. It covers
       things like when to speak, time limits, and how groups of speakers are handled.

   Council Meeting & Agenda Guidelines




                                                                                                          Attachment: 2.15.11 (1422 : Policy and Services Agenda 2/15/2011)
       This section explains the different kinds of meetings the City Council holds, what
       they are for, and how the meeting agenda is prepared.

   Motions, Debate & Voting

       This section explains the simplified rules of parliamentary procedure the Council
       follows (like Roberts’ Rules of Order, but simpler!).

   Quasi-Judicial Hearings

       This section explains the special way the City Council handles hearings that raise
       constitutional due process concerns. These are usually hearings that seriously
       impact someone’s life, liberty or property.

   Standing Committees

       This section explains how the City Council’s two standing committees – Finance
       and Policy & Services – operate during their own separate meetings.
