the terms. Maybe we can even get some examples of what micro unit

maybe a CAC meeting or other community meeting, to begin to have just
open dialog around some of these issues, a community Town Hall around
what are some of the design issues, what are some of the actual impacts of

Mayor Burt: We're at 7:30 P.M. now.

Mr. Shikada: I believe so, yes.
