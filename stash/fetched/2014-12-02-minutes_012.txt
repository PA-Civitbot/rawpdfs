Council Member Scharff noted the second reading would not be placed on
the Consent Calendar because of revisions based on Council Member
comments. Some Council Member comments seemed to conflict.

Mayor Shepherd explained that suggested changes would need to be
approved by the Council.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to delete "resolution" in Section 10.50.040.

Council Member Scharff suggested Section 10.50.020(c) be revised to "an
employee permit shall mean a permit issued for an employee working in Palo
Alto." He asked if an individual Resolution could override provisions of the
Ordinance.

Ms. Gitelman offered a definition of "employee permit shall mean a permit
issued for an employee working at a business located within an RPP District
or as defined within the neighborhood-specific Resolution."

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to Change Section 10.50.020(c) to "employee
permit shall mean a permit issued for an employee working at a business
located within an RPP District or as defined within the neighborhood-specific
Resolution."

Council Member Scharff requested Council Member Klein provide language
for a uniform permit price for residents.

Council Member Klein indicated the City Attorney had prepared language.

Ms. Silver recommended inserting into Section 10.50.060(b) a Number 6
stating "permit rates by City Council policy shall be set at uniform rates
among all Districts." The existing Number 6 would become Number 7.

Council Member Scharff offered one change of "uniform rates for all
residents." The Council could wish to charge different business rates in
different areas.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER that in Section 10.50.060(b), insert a new
Number 6 of "Permit rates by City Council policy shall be set at uniform rates
for all residents among all Districts." Existing Number 6 becomes Number 7.

Council Member Klein advised that he had a second proposed change, and
Ms. Silver had prepared language.
