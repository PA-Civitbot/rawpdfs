Mayor Burt: Thank you.

Ms. Cashmore: Thank you.

Public Hearing closed at 8:38 P.M.

Mayor Burt: We will now close the public hearing and return to the Council
for discussion and a Motion. Vice Mayor Scharff.

Vice Mayor Scharff: Thank you. For me, it seems what's before us is the lot
split itself. I guess, after the lots are split, the houses have to be
demolished first. When houses are designed for this, I assume it goes
through our normal process. If it's two-story, we have to go through
Individual Review. Is that correct?

Mr. Lait: Because three homes are proposed to be redeveloped at the same
time, the Code requires that they go to the Architectural Review Board, and
that takes place of the Individual Review process. There are two-story
homes proposed. That decision was approved November 1st. The appeal
period expires tomorrow on the ARB decision.

Vice Mayor Scharff: What expires tomorrow on the ARB?

Mr. Lait: The ARB decision.

Vice Mayor Scharff: The appeal period?

Mr. Lait: The appeal period expires tomorrow.

Vice Mayor Scharff: There has already been a process on the ARB for this?

Mr. Lait: That's correct, a noticed, Public Hearing.

Vice Mayor Scharff: We've had the noticed, public hearing. We've been
through the process on that. There was a big fundamental process on the
review of the homes and all of that?

Mr. Lait: There was that review.

Vice Mayor Scharff: The approval will require the—I forget what you call it—
the granny unit or the ADU. That's part of the development together?

Mr. Lait: Yes.

Vice Mayor Scharff: I shouldn't have a concern that it won't be built then?
