Council Member Kishimoto said the original amendment was for 100
percent BMR, to accept the staff recommendation but separate out 100
percent rental and services, and put an FAR cap of 2.0 FAR for RT-35.

Ms. Furth clarified the first clause of the motion was to accept the staff
recommendation for 100 percent BMR projects.

Council Member Kishimoto said that was correct.

Council Member Freeman noted that the staff recommendation was for
no FAR limit in the RT-50 zone.

Council Member Kishimoto said that was correct.

Ms. Furth said the first clause in Council Member Kishimoto’s
amendment was to accept the staff recommendation for 100 percent
BMR. The second clause was how to deal with 100 percent rental and
social services.

Council Member Kishimoto said for 100 percent rental and social
services, the amendment was to put an FAR cap of 2.0 for RT-50. In
so far as the FAR was above the base zoning, the FAR bonus was
proportionate to the public benefit. For example, there was a
proportionate increase in very low-and low-income housing versus
moderate. The accepted amendment was to direct staff to come back
with suggested height limitations for the PC area that reflected greater
densities along Alma Street, back toward the eastern end of the area,
and take into account the previous Council’s directives on increasing
housing in the SOFA 2 area.

Senior Planner Virginia Warheit asked what was meant by “eastern
end.”

Vice Mayor Beecham responded the “eastern end” was toward
Middlefield Road.

Council Member Freeman wanted two changes made to the motion.
The Council, at a previous meeting, talked about “associated social
services,” rather than only “social services.” A discussion was held
about Alma Place and the fact there were offices in Alma Place that
were associated with Alma Place social services. The word “associated”
should be added.
