To date, the City of Palo Alto has taken a leadership role in promoting EPR by contributing to
CPSC financially, organizing and providing presentations to the water quality community and
initiating a 2008 meeting with Assembly member Ira Ruskin to ask for his advocacy for both
EPR and CPSC (he later successfully sponsored AB2347 which required wholesalers of

mercury-containing thermostats to set up a collection program for mercury thermostats by
April 1, 2009).
In 2009, RWQCP partnered with the Palo Alto Zero Waste Program and adopted an EPR
resolution and policy to further its efforts in incorporating EPR into its operations. RWQCP
leads the City’s Green Purchasing efforts and has begun the process of incorporating EPR
language for both products and packaging.

3. Residential Thermometer and Thermostat Drop-off Program
The RWQCP’s thermometer and thermostat takeback program, which began in 1998, remains in
operation. The number of thermometers collected annually has decreased significantly since the
conclusion of a very successful campaign in 2004. Thermometer and thermostat takeback will
continue at the RWQCP facility, monthly Household Hazardous Waste events, and special
events upon request. The RWQCP plans to conduct a reenergized, service area-wide
thermometer takeback campaign in 2010 that will involve advertising, multiple locations and
tracking of results on the RWQCP’s cleanbay.org website.

4. Residential Mercury Program Evaluation
About 98 pounds of mercury, including 8,034 thermometers, have been collected since the
program began in January 1998 (Table 4-2). Annual collection varies and can be strongly
influenced by residents that occasionally bring in several pounds of bulk mercury at one time. The
mass of mercury collected can be compared to the RWQCP’s annual influent loading of
approximately 13 pounds. Below is a summary of the amount of mercury products collected at the
RWQCP (Table 4-2) and the HHW Program (Table 4-3).
