Council Member Morton said while the Revised City Policy 1-15 allowed a
park or facility to be named for a living person, it did so only in compelling
circumstances. He did not believe the Policy had radically changed the
tradition of naming areas within the City in memoriam, but rather opened it
up.

Council Member Ojakian asked whether there was anything in the Policy that
would prevent a plaque being placed after the removal of a structure.

Assistant City Manager Harrison said no.

Council Member Ojakian said it was suggested that a plaque could be placed
recognizing those individuals who contributed to the Arastradero Preserve,
and asked whether that could still occur.

Ms. Harrison said yes.

Vice Mayor Burch said the P&S Committee did a lot of work to revise the
Policy and he was anxious to see it go forward.

MOTION PASSED 7-1, Mossar “no”, Kleinberg absent.

Council Member Cordell asked what the next step was in the effort to
rename the Arastradero Preserve after Enid Pearson.
Mr. Betts said with the adoption of a formal nomination form, the nominator
would provide background information on what they felt were the important
contributions Enid Pearson had made to the community, which could be
transmitted to the Council. The staff would check back with PAHA to confirm
their decision, and then bring it back to the PARC for a public hearing.

Vice Mayor Burch asked whether the assumption had been made that the
Arastradero Preserve would be renamed after Enid Pearson, or was there the
option of not renaming it and leaving it as it was.

Ms. Harrison said the issue raised by Vice Mayor Burch was scheduled for an
upcoming Policy and Services Committee meeting and would be discussed
then.

Council Member Mossar opined that Vice Mayor Burch's question touched on
her concern and City Policy 1-15 would not prevent it.

RECESS: 8:45 p.m. to 8:50 p.m.
