      Changes (Note: Given the Complexity of These Issues, This will be the
      First of Two Discussions, with the Second Discussion and Council
      Action on November 17, 2014).

Mayor Shepherd recalled earlier in the year the Council supported a
framework to re-engage the community regarding the long delayed
Comprehensive Plan Update (Update) and to keep the Update on a timeline
for completion by late 2015. On August 6, 2014, the Council paused the
timeline to ask Staff to revise the scope and breadth of the Update; to
consider potential changes to the City's Zoning Code and Zoning Map for
commercial areas; and to conduct a Study Session regarding commercial
zoning changes.
