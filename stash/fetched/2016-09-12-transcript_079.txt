Council Member Wolbach: I'll just associate my views with those of the Vice

We really haven't discussed it. The three of you have talked about it, and
we're just going to pass it. I was also hoping we would have a little bit of a
discussion about this idea of Individual Review. It's been discussed for a
long time.

Mayor Burt:     Again, I will say that the three of us who did speak
