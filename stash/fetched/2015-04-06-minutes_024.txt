Council Member Scharff asked if an urgency ordinance would require
replacement with retail.

Ms. Gitelman explained that the purpose of the urgency ordinance would be
to preserve retail use. If retail space was removed, then it had to be
replaced.

Council Member Scharff assumed that was all ground-floor retail on the
ground floor with the exception of 25 percent for office.

Ms. Gitelman proposed an urgency ordinance that would not allow the 25
percent office exception. It would require preservation of ground-floor retail
until the City reexamined exemptions such as the 25 percent exception for
office.

Council Member Scharff inquired about uses that could replace retail space in
a demolished building.

Ms. Gitelman advised that a project would have to replace the retail use with
the exception of the minimum amount of space required to access the floors
above and below.

Council Member Scharff asked if a demolished building that formerly had 25
percent office could replace the 25 percent office with 25 percent office or all
retail.

Ms. Gitelman indicated that depended on whether office was a permitted use
on the ground floor in that district. If office was permitted in that district, it
could return.

Council Member Scharff inquired about office not being a permitted use.

Ms. Gitelman stated office could not be replaced with office.

Council Member Scharff asked where the 25 percent office was allowed.

Ms. Gitelman explained that the 25 percent office was allowed on the ground
floor in the GF Combining District Downtown. Under the proposed urgency
ordinance, it would not be allowed.

Council Member Scharff inquired whether University Avenue was located in
the GF District.

Ms. Gitelman replied yes.
