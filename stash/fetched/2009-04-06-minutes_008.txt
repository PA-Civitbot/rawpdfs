Council Member Schmid asked how there could be a forecasted 2010 budget
in a freefall situation.

Mr. Perez stated the sales tax revenues were being reviewed in sections in
order to make adjustments. He stated the property tax revenues were being
reviewed by using the County Assessorsâ€™ reports.

Council Member Schmid stated a concern in forecasting the budget for the
next two years with the escalating decline in current revenues.

City Manager, James Keene stated Staff had clearly noted in their first
revenue estimates there would be a decline; the uncertainty was how fast
the decline would take place. He stated there was a projected fiscal year
2010 budget deficit of ten million dollars.

Council Member Schmid asked whether there was an implied risk of Staff not
having the two-year budget prepared.

Mr. Keene stated no, the two-year budget for fiscal year 2010-11 would be
presented to Council.

Council Member Schmid stated there was a revised upward retiree medical
allocation deferral and asked whether the budget indication meant the City
was not making the payments.

Mr. Keene stated there would not be any additional payments to the future
unfunded liability that had been generated by the actuary study completed.

Council Member Schmid asked whether the anticipated recovery was strong
enough to meet the annual requirement and the deferred costs.

Mr. Perez stated there was a required contribution level for the pension
whereas the retiree medical did not have a requirement.

Mr. Keene stated the budget plan was not to use existing reserves to
balance the budget.

Council Member Kishimoto asked whether there had been research into
minimum staffing requirements without sacrificing public safety service
standards.

Mr. Keene stated Staff had met with the leadership in both public safety
unions regarding contract cost saving options for the upcoming budget year.
