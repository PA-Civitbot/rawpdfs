James Keene, City Manager, explained that Agenda Item Number 5
pertained to a general contract related to a range of asphalt and
construction components. He would not recommend removing the item from
the Consent Calendar. As Mr. Borock noted, components of the project
could be eliminated. City Staff would not proceed with the sailing station
component until questions were resolved.

MOTION: Council Member Kniss moved, seconded by Vice Mayor Schmid to
approve Agenda Item Numbers 3-7 including City Manager comments
relating to the section of the contract on Agenda Item Number 5 pertaining
to the Sailing Station Parking Lot.

Mayor Holman asked if Staff would have a process for Agenda Item Number
5 for the following week's discussion.

Mr. Keene believed that information would be available and could respond to
public comment.
