Council Member Lytle asked if the City’s contribution was sharing information
with what had already gone forward, why was the Council involved with a
BAO to handle additional costs.

Mr. Benest said under the City’s system, even when a grant was received
from an outside agency, a BAO had to be done. In this case, the City was
the agency and, in order for the City to contract with a group to do
additional work, a BAO needed to be done.

Council Member Lytle asked Council Member Freeman why a limit was being
placed.

Council Member Freeman said did not want the City to pay anymore out of
its share.

Council Member Lytle withdrew her second to the original amendment.

Council Member Freeman asked if the City Manager returned at the first
meeting in September with the information on the contract services, would
the build-out date still be changed from June to October, a delay of four
months.

Mr. Benest said the timeline was tight for May/June and the recommendation
was to move forward.

Council Member Freeman asked if the City Manager would return in
September with an updated report, which included stages gone through, and
who had been chosen.

Mr. Benest said he would give more information than what was requested.

Council Member Kishimoto asked how the Council would have input on the
