Council Member Barton stated it did.

Vice Mayor Drekmeier wanted to have the Applicant be responsible for the
construction of the park but the maintenance be the responsibility of the
City. This would turn this into a community park and not a private park.

City Attorney Gary Baum stated this would be imposing additional costs to
the City, which were unnecessary.

City Manager Frank Benest stated the City was trying to minimize any
additional financial responsibilities and did not recommend that.

Mr. Baum stated the primary beneficiary was the Homeowners Association.

Council Member Barton stated he was inclined to support the City Manager’s
financial view on that.

Council Member Morton asked at what point could we pose an easement of
half a street on the Southside of the Elks Lodge.

Mr. Emslie stated the Elks Lodge property has not made a formal application.

Council Member Morton stated that we were still separating a lot.

Mr. Emslie stated that there was a second driveway that accesses El Camino
Real in addition to Deodar Street. That would be a site issue that would go
through the Architectural Review Board (ARB) and unless it was appealed, it
would not return to the Council.

Council Member Morton stated if we wanted that option to be available
would we have to add that as a condition of the lot separation.

Mr. Emslie stated that could be a direction to ARB and have them address
that in their review.

Council Member Morton stated he wanted to consider that easement and
make it a condition of the lot division.

Mr. Baum suggested to direct the ARB to examine the issue.

Council Member Morton stated he was concerned regarding the future path
point of connection. He asked if Staff needed Council’s direction to look at an
easement along that corridor.

Mr. Emslie stated that was a discussion under Agenda Item Number 10.
