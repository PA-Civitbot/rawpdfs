Mr. Williams suggested the difference probably resulted from units for the
Tree House project shifting from one category to another, but he would
research that.

Council Member Klein asked Staff to explain carry-over of units from this
cycle to the next.

Mr. Williams explained having a certified Housing Element meant the City
had accommodated zoning for housing and, whether or not the units were
built, units did not carry over. If the City did not have a certified Housing
Element, units that were in the very low, low, and moderate categories and
that were not zoned or built were carried over.

Council Member Klein assumed the City would have a certified Housing
Element.

Mr. Williams indicated if the City had a certified Housing Element, then units
were not carried over.

Mr. Keene stated they would be included in the new base.

Council Member Klein posed the scenario of a certified Housing Element for
the City, an allocation of 2,976 for the current cycle, only 1,500 units of the
required 2,976 constructed during the cycle, and an allocation of 3,000
housing units for the next cycle. He asked whether the City would need to
find 1,500 units (3,000 units allocated less 1,500 units carried over) rather
than 3,000 units for the next cycle.

Mr. Williams answered yes.

Council Member Schmid reported the RHMC voted to deliver a new Housing
Element to the Council within two years.

Council Member Klein inquired how Staff determined the facts presented on
page 296 in the last sentence regarding overcrowding.

Mr. Williams reported the paragraphs above that contained an analysis
based on census information. Based on that analysis, the City's rate for
overcrowding was lower than the State's, County's, Menlo Park's, and
Mountain View's rates.

Council Member Klein suggested the sentence beginning paragraph 4 on
page 297 should be rewritten.
