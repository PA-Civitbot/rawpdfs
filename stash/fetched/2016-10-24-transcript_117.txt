C.           All applicants to be committed to the outcome of determining a
             funding plan that will achieve significant reductions in congestion and

             including paid parking revenue, grants, the Valley Transportation
             Authority (VTA) sales tax; and

D.           Direct the Committee to look at trip reductions both from measures
             that would support alternatives for employees and measures that

             community and elsewhere; and
