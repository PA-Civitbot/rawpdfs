the FEMA requirement regarding the height. It certainly adds a fair amount
to the cost at the same time. We have to have this policy; there's no
question. That's Number 3.        It'd be good to know cost, what other
jurisdictions are doing around us. Pat's been extremely involved with the
creek project and with a number of other jurisdictions and how many other
jurisdictions would be involved with some of these decisions that we make,
especially around the adaptâ€”what was the other? Adapt and ...

Mr. Bobel: Protect.

Council Member Kniss: ... protect plan, because what was presented was
very appealing when you do something that appears much more natural. All

talk a little about that and where we're going with our budget.

Mr. Bobel: That's a big issue for us all. Using the example of the SAFER
project, we have options and we have costs. The expectation is that cost

Council Member Kniss: The FEMA map updates, Number 2, which as you've
said we have nothing to say about, but they ...

Mayor Burt: Council Member Schmid.

Council Member Schmid: Just one very basic question. In the material we
got, there's a section called local projects on Page 9 and 10 of the Staff
Report. It mentions the SAFER project and states there the study and
design for the Bay-front levees between San Francisquito Creek and
Redwood City. On the previous page, under local projects, it has the City of
Mountain View has done a comprehensive sea level rise vulnerability and
adaptation assessment, and the City has developed a Capital Improvement
Program to meet flood protection. If you can turn to your Slide 7, if you
take those two local projects literally, we are doing a job from the
borderlands on the left northward, and Mountain View and the South Bay
