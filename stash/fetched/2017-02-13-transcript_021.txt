Mr. Ah Sing: Or it could be parking or some other development standard.

Council Member DuBois:       Are these proposed to be ownership or rental
units?

Mr. Ah Sing: Actually, I think the applicant would be best to …

Mr. Hayes: May I? Ownership.

Council Member DuBois: I did see the plans. There were two parking
configurations. There was an underground one with like 42 spots. What's
the planned parking?

Mr. Hayes: The plan is to park in accordance with the Ordinance. Right
now, you go down. It descends, and you park below an elevated podium.

Council Member DuBois:      There's one sheet that shows 20 spots and one
that shows 42 spots.

Mr. Hayes: It'll be closer to 42.

Council Member DuBois: What are the two sheets? A1.1 and A1.2.

Mr. Hayes: 1.1 actually shows the parking spaces that are under the
podium. 1.2 is a view from above the podium. You wouldn't see them;
they're tucked underneath.

Council Member DuBois: Got it. Thanks for clarifying that. I did hear some
comments from the public about desire for privacy. More of a comment
would be if this building is higher than the surrounding buildings and the
hotel, make sure there's privacy screens or try to keep as many trees as
possible. A question for Staff. What's Staff's basis for considering rezoning
the lot?

Mr. Lait: The findings that are required or …

Council Member DuBois:      I'm just wondering why you're even considering
the rezone.

Mr. Lait: The Code stipulates that any applicant who is interested in doing a
rezoning request has to go through this prescreening process. We're not
before you with any recommendation. We're just going through the process
of presenting this before you.
