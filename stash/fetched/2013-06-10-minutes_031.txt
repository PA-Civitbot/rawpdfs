to Thursday, June 13, 2013 at 6:00 PM at City Hall, and 2) move the City
Council Retreat, currently scheduled for June 13, 2013 to a date in the first
two weeks of August.

Vice Mayor Shepherd inquired whether a second reading of the Ordinance
would be held on June 24 if the Council approved the Project on June 13.

Mr. Keene answered yes.

Vice Mayor Shepherd asked if the remainder of the Agenda should be
continued to June 13 as well.

Mr. Keene indicated Staff would reschedule items for the meetings scheduled
on June 13, 17 and 24.

Council Member Schmid inquired whether there would be 72 hours to notice
the meeting.

Ms. Stump reported 24 hours were needed to notice a special meeting.

Council Member Klein would not agree to including other items on the June
13, 2013 Agenda, because of the lack of notice to the public.

Mr. Keene agreed with Council Member Klein.

Mayor Scharff noted Agenda Item Numbers 15-18 would be continued to
June 13, but no new Agenda Items would be added.

Council Member Klein felt the Council needed the Retreat.

Mayor Scharff understood the Retreat would be held in August 2013.

Council Member Klein would like a commitment that a Retreat would be held
in August, because the date moved from April to June and now to August.
