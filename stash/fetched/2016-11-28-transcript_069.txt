Vice Mayor Scharff: You didn't talk about the financial benefits of hotels to
the City?

Ms. Gitelman: Just in the broadest possible way, yeah.

Vice Mayor Scharff: Car dealerships, was that at all mentioned?

Ms. Costello: No.

Vice Mayor Scharff: That's what I've got. Thanks.

Mayor Burt: That concludes our questions on this segment. We have a
number of speakers. What I'd like to do is encourage speakers, if their
comments are focused on the broad land use issues that may include
Stanford development, to speak at this time. If they are not related to that,
to wait until the next segment so that Council Member DuBois will be able to
participate and hear those comments. If anybody is in that latter category,
when I call your name just say I'll wait, and I'll put the card aside and we'll
recall you. The first speaker is Keith Bennett.

Keith Bennett: I'll wait.

Mayor Burt: Thank you. Next Bob Moss.

Bob Moss: I'll wait.

Mayor Burt: Thank you. It's going well. Next speaker, Mark Mollineaux.

Mark Mollineaux: No, I can wait.

Mayor Burt: Thank you. Dan Garber.

Dan Garber: I'll wait.

Mayor Burt: Stephanie Munoz. I don't know if she heard. Bill Ross.

Bill Ross: I'll wait.

Mayor Burt: Thank you. Rita Vrhel.

Rita Vrhel: Is Stanford included in the documents that Council Member
Schmid was (inaudible)?

Mayor Burt: Yes.

Rita Vrhel: I will speak.
