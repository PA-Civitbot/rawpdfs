Council Member Drekmeier asked whether staff had concerns regarding
enforcing the TDM program.

Mr. Williams said the TDM program was part of the PC Ordinance and would
be enforced in the same way. An annual review would be required and
necessary adjustments made, as necessary.

Vice Mayor Kishimoto requested that regarding Item 21.b, Exhibit B, page 1,
Mitigation Measure B.1-1, a mitigation be added which would be a City
project to implement bicycle and pedestrian safety improvements on
Charleston Corridor

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH APPROVAL OF THE MAKER
AND SECONDER TO ADD THE WORDING UNDER “Item 21.b, Exhibit B,
page 1, Mitigation Measure B.1-1, a mitigation be added which would be a
City project to implement bicycle and pedestrian safety improvements on
Charleston Corridor.”

Council Member Morton requested it be worded as a request for mitigation
that would require a contribution towards the cost.

Mr. Emslie agreed and said staff would come back with an appropriate
condition to link the project to its funding and the ongoing maintenance of
the Charleston-Arastradero Corridor.

Vice Mayor Kishimoto asked for clarification on the contribution.

Mr. Emslie said a contribution had been made, but a major contribution was
still pending.

Vice Mayor Kishimoto said her intent was that they carry-through with their
commitment and mitigations stay in place.

Council Member Mossar said she understood the project would donate a
specific amount of money, and should the Charleston-Arastradero trial
project not continue, the funds would still be used for the same goals of the
Charleston-Arastradero project.

Mr. Emslie said that was correct.

Council Member Klein said he thought this was the first reading but
understood Mr. Emslie to say the item would be brought back for the first
