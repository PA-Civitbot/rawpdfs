Ms. Eyerly stated both contracts were in the last part of the second year of a
three year contract with an option to renew.

Vice Mayor Espinosa asked what the remaining $160,000 was slated for.

Ms. Eyerly stated the remainder of the funds were anticipated for outreach
materials through the end of the year.

Vice Mayor Espinosa asked whether these contracts were on a fiscal calendar
and therefore would not be up for renewal until summer of 2011.

Ms. Eyerly stated yes.

Council Member Schmid stated he liked the notion of base incentives to push
people towards recycling. He was skeptical that the City would be able to
generate the funds that were needed to balance the budget while creating
those incentives. He proposed an Amendment that the rate increase would
be for 9 months and expired July 1, 2011.

AMENDMENT: Council Member Schmid moved, seconded by Council
Member XXXX that the rate increase expire in 9 months on July 1, 2011.

Council Member Scharff asked Council Member Schmid to clarify his
Amendment was for the rate increase to expire in 9 months.

Council Member Schmid stated yes, to have the rate increase expire after 9
months.

Council Member Scharff stated the question that arose was if Staff was to
have the Comprehensive Study completed in the fall. If the rate increase
was to expire in 9 months would Staff have completed the Study and
returned to Council with recommendations by July 1, 2011.

Mr. Keene stated one of the driving elements was to ensure there was
sufficient cash flow by the end of the Fiscal Year to comply with the State
requirement.

Mr. Baum stated due to the complexity of the Study and the lag time with
the Proposition 218 requirements the July 1, 2011 deadline seemed to be
unreasonable. He recommended against the earlier time frame.

Mayor Burt asked what amount of time appeared reasonable for Staff.
