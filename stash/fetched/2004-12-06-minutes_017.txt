Gary Curtis said he was opposed to the development because there were too
many houses too close to the existing trees on the property.

Anatol Kaganovich, 706 La Para Avenue, said he supported the request for
the subdivision.

Anthony Ho, 137 Amanda Lane, Los Gatos, said all five lots would be able to
accommodate three-bedroom homes.

Menachem Cohen, 830 Arroyo Court, said his home was one of a five-lot
project similar to the proposed project. He supported the project.

Ken Aueobach, 825 Matadero Avenue, said he had concerns about five two-
story houses crowded onto the lot and towering over the predominantly one-
story houses in the neighborhood. He also had concerns about traffic and
the destruction of the trees on the property.

Council Member Morton asked Mr. Aueobach whether he had concerns about
the possibility of two-story houses or the possibility of five houses.

Mr. Aueobach said his major concern was creating a different look in the
neighborhood.

Douglas B. Moran, 790 Matadero Avenue, said the Council had two questions
to address: 1) the mitigated negative declaration, and 2) the deficient
habitat report. It was the applicantâ€™s burden to demonstrate to a high
degree of confidence that the proposed Subdivision Map would lead to a
successful outcome. The applicant had failed to do that.

Council Member Mossar asked why the three parcels appeared to have
special consideration for riparian habitat.

Mr. Moran noted the plan said conditions should be improved and mistakes
not repeated.

Council Member Mossar asked why the property would be held to a different
standard than other property.

Mr. Moran said there would be a lot of pressure on the setbacks because the
backyards were small.

Council Member Mossar said setback requirements would remain the same.

Mr. Moran said the setbacks were a legal requirement.
