Study Session

6.    Study Session on PaloAltoGreen Program Redesign Options.

Jane Ratchye, Assistant Utilities Director presented options for City Council's
(Council) consideration to completely re-vamp the PaloAltoGREEN program,
to eliminating the program. Council Members expressed interests that also
ranged from continuing the program as is to eliminating the program. Some
Council Members asked what benefits the program provided if the Electric
Portfolio was Carbon Neutral; some favored changing the program to
support local solar or to reduce carbon emissions from natural gas usage.
Members of the public also provided their feedback. Staff was developing
recommendations that the project be first presented to the Utilities Advisory
Commission (UAC), based on the input provided at the Study Session.

John Foster, Vice Chair of UAC reported PaloAltoGreen was the leading
voluntary green power procurement program in the United States when
measured on a per capita adoption basis. Based on discussions at the UAC,
he believed all members of the UAC supported continuing the Program in
some form. There was support for continuing the focus on electricity and
considering a green gas program. The vast majority of participants would
continue to participate if a new program continued the ideals of
PaloAltoGreen Program.
