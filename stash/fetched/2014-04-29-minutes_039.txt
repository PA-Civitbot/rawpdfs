Mr. Ganoung called Mr. Swanson on the matter three or four days after the
document was published and recommended Mr. Swanson review the
document.

Council Member Burt recommended Staff discuss the matter with the City
Attorney.

Mr. Keene reported the City Attorney had been an integral part of the
conversation.

Mayor Shepherd asked when Staff learned of the EA.

Mr. Swanson advised that he contacted SFO after learning about the EA from
Congresswoman Eshoo.

Mayor Shepherd felt the teardrop pattern would have looked the same a
year ago; however, the Council began hearing complaints in the fall of 2013.

Mr. Ganoung indicated the teardrop pattern was an existing arrival pattern.
The noise would have occurred over the past 10 or even 20 years. He
invited Council Members and Staff to SFO to discuss the document and
patterns.

Council Member Klein inquired about the authority under which the
Roundtable operated.

Mr. Ganoung stated the Roundtable was an independent entity comprised of
elected officials from San Mateo and San Francisco Counties.

Council Member Klein asked if it operated under some law.

Mr. Ganoung advised that the Roundtable operated under the Brown Act and
had its own Charter.

Council Member Klein wanted Palo Alto to be a member of the Roundtable
and did not understand why Palo Alto was excluded.

Mr. Ganoung reported the City was welcome to make that request at a
Roundtable meeting.

Mr. Keene stated he would begin efforts for the City to join the Roundtable.
