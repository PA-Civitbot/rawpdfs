Mayor Burt: Yeah.

Mr. Keene: Did we finish with Community Services?

Female: No.

Vice Mayor Scharff: No.

Mr. Keene: Could we do that first?

Male: Yeah.

Mayor Burt: Vice Mayor Scharff.

Vice Mayor Scharff: We're doing Community Services. I guess I wanted to
know why (inaudible) Park was yellow. I didn't quite understand it when it
said budgeted, which means good, and not fully resourced. The hydrology
study is taking longer than expected to begin (crosstalk).

Mayor Burt: (crosstalk) 14.

Vice Mayor Scharff: Yes, Number 14. Maybe you could just sort of give us
an update.

Mr. de Geus: That's a good question, Council Member Scharff. It is moving
forward, and you'll have something in front of you for a contract to do the
hydrology study for Buckeye Creek. It's just we would have liked to get it to
you 6 months earlier. Staff from Public Works and Community Services
Department (CSD) have just had to prioritize other CIPs ahead of this one.

Vice Mayor Scharff: I think this might be a useful moment for me to just
understand. The fact that we made something yellow doesn't mean it's not
moving forward. In this case it just means it's moving forward slower than
Staff would have liked.

Mr. de Geus: That's correct.

Vice Mayor Scharff: If I asked you what it would take to make it green, the
answer is really nothing because you're moving it forward. Is that fair?

Mr. de Geus: We are moving it forward. If we were really concerned about
it and we wanted to really speed it up, we might then look at slowing down
another CIP so Staff can work a little more on this one.

Vice Mayor Scharff: What other CIPs would you slow down to do this? If I
said to you ...
