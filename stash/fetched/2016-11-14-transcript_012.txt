                         TRANSCRIPT
Mr. Perez: You want me to read the items?

Mayor Burt: Yeah.

Vice Mayor Scharff: Just read it to us.

Mr. Perez: That's our fault, by the way, not the Clerk's Office. What we are
correcting are the following. We want to eliminate the reappropriation in the
General Fund Capital Improvement Fund for the Quarry Road improvements.
It's in the amount of $65,618. These funds were already encumbered in '16
and have been carried forward. It would be a duplicative transaction. The
second adjustment is to correct the reappropriation for the street lights
improvement project from -$61,539 to $44,079. An encumbrance was
incorrectly booked beyond this project, which reduced the availability of the
funds. Those are the two changes we would recommend.

Vice Mayor Scharff: Thank you.

Mayor Burt: Council Member Holman.

Council Member Holman: I'll also be voting no on 15.
