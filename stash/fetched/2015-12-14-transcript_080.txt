Mr. Keene: The 25th?

Mayor Holman: Yeah, January 25th.

Mr. Keene: There was the potential for some involved follow-up from the
Sustainability retreat.

Mayor Holman: I see. That's what that all is. That's what that all is. I'll
retract that.

Council Member Scharff: I want to know what the deadlines are for the
grant funding and why (crosstalk).

Brad Eggleston, Public Works Assistant Director: Your question, Council
Member Scharff, we've recently had to request an extension on our Federal
grant funding from having approval on January 1, 2017 to January 1, 2018.
Given the delays we've had in this process and the long Caltrans process,
we're still concerned about even making those deadlines. It's not a sure
thing that we can always roll this money over.

Council Member Scharff: With all respect, given that, why does 30 days
make a difference? You just said we're talking about 2018 or 2017. Why
would 30 days make a difference on this? In all seriousness, why?

Mr. Eggleston: Potentially this 30 days is not the one that's critical, but it's
the overall pattern of having trouble getting decisions and moving on with
the project.

Mr. Keene: How much is the Federal money?

Mr. Eggleston: $4 million.

Council Member Scharff: I'd move we don't take the Bike Bridge up tonight,
but we take it up in January.

Council Member Wolbach" I'd second that.

MOTION: Council Member Scharff moved, seconded by Council Member
Wolbach to continue Agenda Item Number 25 - Review and Accept the Public
Safety Building Site â€¦ to a meeting in January.

Mr. Keene: Madam Mayor?

Mayor Holman: Yes, City Manager.

Mr. Keene: How full is the January 11th meeting?
