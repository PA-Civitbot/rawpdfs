Council Member Kniss: They would first, I imagine, appeal to you, since
that's what we have talked about as who would decide. You're saying that
you would then take it to the Council to make that decision as to whether or
not they were an economic hardship.

Ms. Gitelman: That's correct.

Council Member Kniss: This burden is going to be on whomever owns the
property to do that.

Ms. Gitelman: That's correct.

Mayor Holman: I think we are ready to vote. Given we've gone down this
path, if we could scroll to the top so we could ...

Council Member DuBois: Did we agree to add automotive services back in?
I wasn't clear.

Ms. Gitelman: I thought that Council Member Scharff had retracted his
agreement to that last item on the screen. It's no longer incorporated into
the Motion with the consent of the maker.

Mayor Holman:       Council Member Scharff, you retracted the automotive
services, but ...

Council Member Scharff: What's your question? I'm willing to put in
automotive services, if we get rid of the last one. You'd have to withdraw
your second too, since it says seconded by Mayor Holman.

Mayor Holman: I could do that.

Council Member Wolbach: That was accepted by you and me.

Council Member Scharff: Oh, it was?

Council Member Wolbach: The maker, you, and seconder, me. If any of the
three of us withdraws it, it's gone.

Council Member Scharff: Then I would withdraw it.

AMENDMENT WITHDRAWN BY THE SECONDER, “to add to the Motion,
“replace in Municipal Code Section 18.85.103(a) "submitted to the City" with
"approved by the Director.”
Council Member Burt: I move that we now put back automotive services as
one of the definitions of retail.
