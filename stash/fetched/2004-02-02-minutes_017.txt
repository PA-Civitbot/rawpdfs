going through the P&S Committee.

Council Member Morton noted the Auditorâ€™s Service             Efforts   and
Accomplishments Report indicated a decline in recycling.

Assistant City Manager Harrison said staff would be reporting to the P&S
Committee in March on the Single Stream Refuse Trial, which had been
successful but would be a policy issue.

Council Member Kleinberg suggested a notice explaining the Americans with
Disabilities Act (ADA) complaint be put on the recycle cans.

Council Member Ojakian questioned the action Council could take if it
wanted to hear the matter on color zones, since action was made internally.

Ms. Harrison stated staff would initiate discussions with the Chamber of
Commerce and the business district.

Mayor Beecham stated parking was vital to the merchants and staff would
return with recommendations after talking with businesses.

Vice Mayor Burch questioned whether the City was responding quickly and
consistently enough regarding code enforcement.

Mayor Beecham noted since Council Member Freeman had a possible
conflict regarding the City/School Liaison Committee, the alternate
appointment for the time being would be Vice Mayor Burch. He noted he
would have appointments made to the Blue Ribbon Attorney Search
Committee by the end of the week.
