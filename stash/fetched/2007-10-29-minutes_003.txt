STUDY SESSION

2.    Review of Proposed Amendments to Chapters 15 and 16 of the Palo
      Alto Municipal Code Adopting the 2007 Editions of the California Fire,
      Building, Mechanical, Electrical, and Plumbing Codes and the 2005
      Edition of the California Energy Code


Council Member Kleinberg stated she would not participate in Item 2 due to
a conflict as she had been employed by Joint Ventures Silicon Valley Network
for two years to create a coalition of cities, including Palo Alto, to dissuade
cities from adopting amendments to codes.

Staff presented an overview of the adoption process for the new California
Building and Fire Codes and a summary of the proposed local amendments
to be adopted into the Palo Alto Municipal Code to become effective January
1, 2008. Staff worked with building, fire and hazardous materials officials in
Santa Clara County and other nearby agencies for more than six months to
develop regional amendments to promote regional consistency to the extent
possible and to maintain the current code requirements. No significant new
requirements are proposed.

A public hearing will be held November 13, 2007. A second reading will be
heard on November 26, 2007 and the codes and proposed amendments will
become effective January 1, 2008.
