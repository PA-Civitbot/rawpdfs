the Army Corps to complete their feasibility study and provide
recommendations. The City would then know what impacts the Golf Course
redesign would have on the Creek.

Council Member Beecham asked if the JPA’s decision was two to three years
out, and what work should the City have completed in advance in order to
consider the options

Mr. Roberts felt the question should be referred to the JPA for review.

Council Member Mossar said to ask the Army Corps what they needed from
those lands. The project could be designed once the needs were known.
Constraints must be known before the project could be redesigned.

Council Member Beecham said the proposal suggested an evaluation working
concurrently with the Zoning Ordinance Update (ZOU) currently in progress.
He questioned the advantages of this process.

Mr. Emslie said there were no advantages or disadvantages. Separate staff
members would handle the ZOU and there would be no change to the
workload from the ZOU’s standpoint.

Council Member Beecham asked about the current contract with the Golf
Course -operators.

Community Services Director Richard James said both the restaurant and
the Pro Shop operators had ten-year contracts.

Council Member Beecham asked when the first contract expired and
questioned early termination rights.

Mr. James said the first contract would expire in 2013 and the City would be
able to buy out both contracts.

Council Member Beecham asked what advantage would there be in pursuing
the project now or to wait another two years.

Mr. Benest said it would be Council’s call. There would be a variety of
opportunities, issues, and constraints. The work plan would need to be
adjusted for the short-term or could be programmed at a later date.
