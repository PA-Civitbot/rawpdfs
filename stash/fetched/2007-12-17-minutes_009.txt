James Furgas, 295 89th Street, Daly City stated the employees who currently
worked for PASCO should be hired for the job and he supported this project.

Herb Borock, P.O. Box 632 stated the Council should approve the actual
complete language of the Scope of Services.

Vice Mayor Klein asked when the Request for Proposal (RFP) was to be
approved.

Mr. Roberts stated the Council did not approve the full contract document of
the RFP.

Vice Mayor Klein asked for clarification that the bid factors were not tied to
any certain bidder.

Mr. Roberts stated he was correct.

Vice Mayor Klein stated if there were two bidders, they could not be
anonymous.

Mr. Roberts stated that it was a possibility.

Vice Mayor Klein asked for clarification whether they would know what bid
went for each bidder.

Mr. Roberts stated no, there would not be any details given for each bidder.

Bob Hilton, HF&H Consultant, stated we should be focusing on the services
and not on the selection of a contractor. He added that the highest rated
companies would be proposed to the Council and would allow the Council to
focus on the two companies.

Vice Mayor Klein asked whether all of that would be further down the
process.

Mr. Hilton stated the services and cost benefits of step three were being
focused on.

Vice Mayor Klein clarified that step three would just be a range of numbers
and the low-end numbers in one category could be from three different
bidders.

Mr. Hilton stated he was correct.

Vice Mayor Klein asked where the numbers would come from.
