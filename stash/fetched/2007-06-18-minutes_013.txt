Mr. Emslie stated the P&TC could make a recommendation, although there
was a definite testimony from the Palo Alto Housing Corporation that
preferred the housing in this configuration.

Council Member Drekmeier asked whether the Maker of the Motion intended
to include something on the Fire Department consultation.

Mr. Klein stated this should be considered as part of the review process.

Council Member Drekmeier asked the City Attorney whether there should be
clarification.

Mr. Baum stated there was no need to include anything that was part of the
review process.

Council Member Drekmeier asked for clarification whether there were three
buildings or the equivalent to the square footage.

Vice Mayor Klein stated he wanted the three buildings.

Council Member Drekmeier asked whether there was flexibility with the
buildings or if it had to be three buildings.

Mr. Emslie stated the proposal was to have three buildings and if the project
could be improved, they can move forward with that recommendation to the
Council.

Ms. Holman noted her concerns with Page 1, Section 1b, which read, “the
proposed project depicted on Attachment A (the “Project”), as revised by
conditions included in the Planned Community allowable land uses and
required development standards, and subject to provision of the public
benefits outlined below.”

Mayor Kishimoto stated she did not support the motion as it was a binding
document. She asked for this to be first reviewed by the P&TC and then by
the ARB.
