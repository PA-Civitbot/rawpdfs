Mayor Beecham asked Council Member Freeman if her intent was to extract
Exhibit E and send it to the P&S Committee.

Council Member Freeman said that was her intent, and to have the P&S
Committee review and return with recommendations on how to ensure
equity among DBEs.

Mayor Beecham said the motion should be brought up after the vote.

MOTION WITHDRAWN BY MAKER

MOTION PASSED 8-1, Freeman “no.”

MOTION: Council Member Freeman moved, seconded by Kishimoto, that
the Policy and Services (P&S) Committee review and provide
recommendations to ensure that Disadvantaged Business Enterprises (DBEs)
are on a pre-qualifying list.

Council Member Freeman said the City only viewed DBEs owned by women
or minorities on Federally funded projects. The annual goal of the projects
was to offer business to 25 percent of the DBEs. The percentage had been
reduced to 2.5 percent the previous year. If possible, the P&S Committee
should evaluate and recommend the City look beyond the Federally funded
contracts and look at contracts as a whole.

Council Member Kishimoto suggested the requirement be widened to
minority and women-owned businesses.

Ms. Furth said Proposition 209 influenced the City’s ability to be conscious of
the ownership of entities with which the City contracted; it was forbidden,
except with respect to Federally funded projects.

Council Member Kishimoto said there was a goal of diversifying who bid on
the City’s projects and how to word the proposal.

Ms. Furth said staff could be asked to come back to the Council to formulate
proposals.

City Manager Frank Benest said a meeting could be scheduled with the P&S
Committee to discuss what had been done and the constraints.

Vice Mayor Burch said he did not believe a new policy was needed, nor did it
need to be referred to the P&S Committee.
