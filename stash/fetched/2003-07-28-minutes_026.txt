Vice Mayor Beecham said the property was currently under residential
use and would be exempted from converting because of limitations
referred to by Council Member Lytle.

Mr. Emslie said it was zoned CDS.

Council Member Freeman asked if there were any other zoning that
would trump plans for the corridor.

Mr. Emslie said there were two other residential buildings zoned as
CD-S but were more in residential area and protected from conversion
into offices. The only building exempted was 731 Emerson Street.

Council Member Freeman asked if the three locations being exempted
were 731 Emerson and RM-30 and the RM-15 on Homer Avenue.

Mr. Emslie said those three locations were protected and continued to
be protected against conversion because they were allowed to be used
for residential. The motion would not impact properties zoned
residential.

Council Member Freeman asked if all zoned properties had been
identified in that area.

Mr. Emslie said everything had been accounted for.
