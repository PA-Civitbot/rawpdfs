requirements for listing the votes. Ordinance 18.77.075 (g) 2 was the
regulation which referred to four votes being required.

Vice Mayor Kleinberg asked the City Attorney to clarify the difference
between the two requirements.

Mr. Baum said in an effort to streamline the Individual Review (IR) process,
the Council passed an Ordinance requiring four votes to remove an IR item
from Consent. An initial review followed by a Director’s Hearing, consisted
of a public hearing and a notice prior to a full and complete hearing.

Mayor Burch said if the item was removed from Consent, the public would
need to be heard at tonight’s meeting as well as a future hearing.

Mr. Baum said that was correct. The Brown Act required the public to be
able to speak on every item listed on the agenda.

Council Member Morton asked to separate the Consent Calendar and vote on
Items No. 5, 6, 9 and 9A.

Herb Borock, P.O. Box 632, spoke regarding agenda Item No.4 and asked to
delay the enactment until the 50 foot, right-of-way of Arastradero Road from
the park dedication, was omitted.

Mayor Burch said due to the large volume of speakers on Item No. 7, he
asked colleagues to proceed by voting separately on each item.
