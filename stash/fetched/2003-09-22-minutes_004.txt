Member Lytle’s comments were merely asking to clarify her primary
point. She asked for a more respectful debate at a P&S Committee
meeting.

Council Member Morton said Council Member Lytle only needed to ask
the Clerk to change the word Palo Alto to VTA (Valley Transportation
Authority). He believed extraneous material was being added, which
was not part of the original minutes.

Mayor Mossar said Council Member Lytle said the minutes could be
sent back to the City Clerk for a simpler version or the motion on the
floor was to approve the minutes, as amended.

Council Member Burch said he wanted to go with the minutes as they
were.

MOTION PASSED 9-0.
