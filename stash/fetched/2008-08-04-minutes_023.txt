versus compensation.

Council Member Yeh asked for a clarification when the contract returned to
Council.

Mr. Roberts stated yes, when the rate setting process returns to Council in
2009 there will be a clear understanding of the compensation to the hauler
and the total Refuse Fund.

Mayor Klein asked whether the current PASCO employees would be offered
positions with the new company.

Mr. Roberts stated it was a contractual obligation and has been brought to
negotiations. He noted if GreenWaste was not agreeable then negotiations
would move forward with Norcal.

Mayor Klein asked for clarification on the remaining two-thirds cost to the
rate payer.

Mr. Roberts stated the other areas in which the rate payersâ€™ funds were for
weekly street sweeping, landfill operations, payments to Sunnyvale for the
Smart Station and Kirby Canyon.
Mayor Klein asked for the estimated inflation rate.

Mr. Roberts stated the potential increase would be five percent; however
that number will be refined with the rate setting process which will return to
Council mid-year 2009.

Mayor Klein asked why two-thirds of the estimated increase was five percent
when the increase for the process was three percent.

Mr. Roberts suggested bringing back to Council at a later date the projection
from the Refuse Fund which had the estimated numbers.

Vice Mayor Drekmeier asked for clarification on the landfill rent payment
schedule.

Mr. Roberts stated the Refuse Fund had extended the rent payments for the
landfill to 2021 in order to taper off the back of the General Fund.

Vice Mayor Drekmeier clarified once the landfill was closed, the City would
be paying rent for the facility and paying Z-Best for processing and disposal
fees.
