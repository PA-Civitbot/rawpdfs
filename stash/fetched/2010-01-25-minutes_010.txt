lla. (Former No.8)    Utilities Advisory Commission Recommendation to
     Adopt a Resolution 9035 entitled "Resolution of the Council of the City
     of Palo Alto Establishing a Salinity Reduction Policy for Recycled
     Water."

Council Member Schmid asked why a plan was not in place to conduct an
analysis of the recycled water supply.

Manager of Environmental Compliance, Phil Bobel Stated state law mandated
recycled water was usable; the analysis of the Total Dissolved Solids (TDS)
levels would not change the State law. There was demonstration of decades
of recycled water usage with higher levels of TDS without causing any
issues.

Council Member Schmid requested a policy be included to investigate the
usage of recycled water with TDS levels.

Mr. Bobel stated the policy was being altered to include the language for
sampling of TDS levels.
