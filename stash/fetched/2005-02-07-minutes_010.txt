the bid.

Real Property Manager Bill Fellman said staff proposed to use the same
process for selling property. A minimum bid would be set and return to
Council with a Request for Bid Proposal (RFP) for review. It would then be
advertised, and the sealed bids would qualify for oral bids, at which time the
highest bid would be brought back to Council for approval.

Council Member Kishimoto did not think that was written into the Ordinance.

Mr. Fellman said the Real Estate process was used in selling property.

Council Member Kishimoto asked whether it was the process used by the
City Manager when establishing the formal bidding procedure.

Mr. Fellman said it was included in the report that went to the P&TC.

MOTION: Council Member Kishimoto moved, seconded by Beecham, to
approve the staff and Planning and Transportation Commission (P&TC)
recommendation to:

      1.   Approve the proposed revisions to the Zoning Code, Chapters
           18.87, 18.49 and 18.32, to allow eligible City-owned historic
           properties (Category 1 or Category 2), including historic
           properties that are also seismic risk properties (Seismic Category
           I, II, or III), located in any zone district to be “sender sites”
           under the TDR ordinance, transferring historic or seismic
           rehabilitation floor area bonuses from these sites to eligible
           “receiver” sites located in the Downtown CD Zone District;
      2.   Modify the procedures and requirements for granting floor area
           bonuses;
      3.   Modify    the    residential   density   and   site   development
           requirements for residential mixed use projects located in the
           CD-C zone district to facilitate use of TDR for residential use;
           and
