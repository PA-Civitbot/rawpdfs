Council Member Beecham would not participate in the item due to
a conflict of interest because he had a former client within a
radius of the project.

Vice Mayor Mossar would not participate in the item due to a
conflict of interest because she owned property in the affected
area.

Council Member Morton would not participate in the item due to
a conflict of interest because he had a client within the South
of Forest Avenue (SOFA) Plan area.

Council Member Kishimoto said she was the Council liaison to
the SOFA Working Group and proposed the recommendation on how
to proceed with the process.    Due to the size of the SOFA 2
packet and since it had been delivered on Friday, members of
public had expressed they did not have enough time to review it
properly. Since Council would be coming back to the item in
November, she proposed to consider not having public comment
and limiting the item to only the staff presentation and
Council questions.
