statement, and after that it refers to the goals. I would just put that into a
new "B" and eliminate the word "and." Does that seem reasonable?

Council Member DuBois: Yeah.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to separate Part A in the Motion into two Parts
after, “Council review and.”

Council Member Burt: Second, I wanted to go a bit in the direction of what I
think maybe Council Member Berman was aiming for. I found his motion to
be very sweeping; it could mean that we want to put higher density housing
in our open space and our R-1 neighborhoods and those kinds of things. I
wouldn't support that. More specifically, my amendment would be to direct
Staff and the CAC to—in this case I'll actually start with the word "develop"—
develop policies and programs that would provide greater incentives for
mixed-use retail/residential in our University Avenue and Cal. Ave. areas.
I'm sorry, I should have said "small unit residential."

Mayor Holman: Council Member DuBois?

Council Member DuBois: Yeah, I'll accept that.

Mayor Holman: I'm sorry. That was a yes?

Council Member DuBois: Yes.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to add to the Motion, “direct Staff and the CAC to
Develop policies and programs that provide greater incentives for mixed
used retail and small unit residential in the University Avenue and California
Avenue.” (New Part H)

Council Member Burt: After "incentives," it should be "incentives for," I
guess. That was accepted, so that's "H." That's it.

Mayor Holman: Council Member Wolbach.

Council Member Wolbach: One last housing addition. This is just direction
to the CAC and the Staff. Hopefully it's amenable to the maker and the
seconder. To direct the CAC to maintain and strengthen existing language
supportive of housing supply for diverse family sizes, ages, ability levels and
income levels.

Mayor Holman: Council Member DuBois?
