and a temporary employee. That office could also operate Palo Alto's TMA if
the Council desired.

Stephanie Munoz suggested shuttle service to medical clinics be divided by
area of the City and day of the week. Valet parking was not feasible as
there was no place to park cars. Businesses should not pay for all programs.

Maâ€™ayan Dembe noted shuttles were not routed to the California Avenue
business district, Menlo Park, and Mountain View. She questioned the cost
of shuttles for riders and the selection of the TwoGo ride share app.

Adina Levin, Friends of Caltrain, indicated TDM Programs were a trend in the
region, particularly in the Caltrain Corridor. The proposed programs were
good first steps. The City should survey the population to determine the
rider base. New parking revenue sources could be utilized to reduce the
need to build additional parking.

Hal Mikelson, Palo Alto Chamber of Commerce, advocated for the use of
incentives to increase participation in TDM Programs.

Gabrielle Layton hoped measures were accompanied by strong data analysis
to prove measures were effective.

consider routes proposed by RFP respondents.
