Mr. Ulrich said the expenditures were included in the budget and
brought forward as a recommendation.

Mr. Kolling clarified the City Attorney’s Office recommended the City
Council approve the $21.5 million settlement.

Council Member Freeman questioned post payment and why the
Budget Amendment Ordinance (BAO) was brought forward to the
public.

Administrative Services Director Carl Yeats said the timing of the
payment was based on authorization received from the City Attorney
to negotiate the settlement. The BAO was necessary to amend the
budget and to recognize the payment in 2004-2005 fiscal year. The
settlement disclosure was in each year’s financial statements since the
original transaction with Enron was terminated. It was in the financial
statement notes and recognized as an expense for the current fiscal
year.

Council Member Beecham said Sonoma County and Santa Clara
County were involved in the same situation. He asked the City
Attorney if he knew of other agencies that had been in the same
situation and had settled

Mr. Kolling said the only other agency he was aware of in negotiations
with Enron was the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California.
The cities of Roseville, Redding, and Riverside, and a municipal agency
in Utah had settled.

Council Member Beecham said apparently 90 to 95 percent were in
similar suits and had settled.

Mr. Kolling said he did not know the exact percentage but there were a
large number of companies that negotiated power, gas, and financial
contracts and other small entities relating to power transactions had
settled.

Council Member Beecham asked whether their settlements had been
made public.

Mr. Kolling said the information could probably be obtained from the
court website, but it was difficult to ascertain what Enron had filed
against the agencies and the amount of each settlement.
