manufacturing use, even if office uses ancillary to those uses occupy more
floor area than the research and development or manufacturing use itself.

Council Member Morton did not want to end up driving industries or
businesses out of the area.

Vice Mayor Beecham clarified the intent of the motion was to be sure there
were no circular definitions.

Council Member Lytle said the solution might be to limit the section from the
PAMC if uses were not to be limited.

AMENDMENT         PASSED    6-1,     Morton   “no,”   Kleinberg,   Mossar   “not
participating.”

Mr. Benest asked whether there was a sense the Council wanted to allow the
flexibility within.

Vice Mayor Beecham clarified the motion was not made with an intent to
limit flexibility.

Council Member Lytle did not want to be disingenuous about a limitation that
was not really a limitation. If staff recommended “no limit” because it did not
allow sufficient flexibility, the limitation should be eliminated.

Mr. Calonne said one way to get flexibility was to have a quantitative
maximum that could be exceeded with a use permit.

Vice Mayor Beecham said his understanding of the motion was to insure the
definition was not circular.

Mr. Calonne said the definition spoke to ancillary. Staff would be asked to
come up with a quantitative standard and flexibility to go beyond with a
discretionary permit.

Council Member Morton asked whether the discretionary permit required
Council approval.

Mr. Calonne said the idea was that there would be a safe level of office use,
and more than that required analysis.

Vice Mayor Beecham clarified the ordinance would return to the Council.

Mr. Calonne said that was correct.
