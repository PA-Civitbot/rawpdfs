Arthur Keller, 3881 Corina Way, spoke regarding the bus lines associated
with the schools and their time schedules.

Herb Borock, P.O. Box 632, suggested involving the community with the
routes and quality of the lines.

Robert Moss, 4010 Orme Street, stated in order to maintain ridership, the
lines needed to be more efficient.

Council Member Mossar stated the response to VTA needed to state reasons
why Palo Alto deserves better service.

MOTION: Council Member Mossar moved, seconded by Barton, to request
staff to strengthen the language in the letter to the Valley Transportation
Authority with reasons why Palo Alto deserves a good transit system and
provides the history about how Palo Alto got into a situation where the
transit system was inadequate.

Mayor Kishimoto asked why VTA determined to change the line in January of
2008.

Mr. Risto stated the staff proposed a balance between service and cost
neutral.

Mayor Kishimoto asked whether the changes were considered budgetary or
needs based.

Mr. Risto stated the goal was to maintain service within a budget.

Mayor Kishimoto stated the understanding from Mr. Burns was that it would
not be budgetary.

Mr. Risto stated there was room for adjustment within the proposed plan. If
one area required more service than another area, it would be adjusted to
maintain the budgetary structure of VTA.

Vice Mayor Klein asked for clarification on the adjustment of service.

Mr. Risto stated the original objective was to keep it cost neutral. If there
were additional resources for one community, there would be reduced
service levels elsewhere.

Vice Mayor Klein asked what the criteria were for the study.

Mr. Risto stated the criteria of the comprehensive operational analysis (COA)
