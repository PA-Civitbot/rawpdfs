Ms. Erickson said the idea was to look at response time, placement of
stations, and placement of different engine companies over the past years.

Mayor Kishimoto said the budget needed to look at substantial areas of
necessity and take the rationalization to the community. She asked when
the budget discussions would return to the Council.

Ms. Harrison stated the budget discussions had been placed on the calendar
for March 12, 2007.

Mayor Kishimoto wanted to be sure Council Member Mossar and Vice Mayor
Klein were able to attend.

Council Member Mossar stated they would return March 13, 2007.

Mr. Benest suggested March 6, 2007 for the return of the budget
discussions.

Ms. Harrison suggested the Mayor and the City Manager work together to
coordinate a date and then inform the public.

Council Member Morton asked for a list of departments that showed cost
savings due to retirements.

Mr. Benest stated most of the positions retiring were to be re-filled. The cost
savings occurred when positions were combined. Generally, there was going
to be a net reduction of four positions.

Council Member Morton asked whether it was anticipated for all four
positions to be out of the same department.

Mr. Benest said he was uncertain until the completion of the retirements and
postings were filled.

Vice Mayor Klein stated it appeared that $947,000 of the proposed
reductions out of the $2.5 million were in question. The proposed budget
appeared to be a good start.
