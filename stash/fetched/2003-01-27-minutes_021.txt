Mr. Calonne was unsure how clear the range of options was to the P&TC.

Council Member Kishimoto was concerned about the precedent with the
Stanford GUP where the City allowed a certain amount of square feet of
development but added no net traffic increase.

Mr. Calonne said the no net traffic increase was fine; specifying a trip
reduction program as the means by which to accomplish no net traffic
increase was not allowed.

Council Member Kishimoto did not know if there was agreement about going
for no net traffic increase. A standard for managing traffic increase should be
developed.

Vice Mayor Beecham said the basic concept was to include TDM standards.

Council Member Ojakian asked whether the discussion applied only to the
Research Park. If it applied across the board to the various zones, how
would Mayor Mossar and Council Member Kleinberg get their voices heard.

Mr. Calonne said the discussion would be brought up again when the motion
came up.

AMENDMENT PASSED 5-2, Morton, Ojakian “no,” Kleinberg, Mossar “not
participating.”

AMENDMENT: Council Member Kishimoto moved, seconded by Lytle, that
when staff returns to Council to include a California Environmental Quality
Act (CEQA) evaluation for an analysis of the impact of jobs/housing
balances.

Council Member Kishimoto said she was willing to look at flexibility but
wanted the largest impacts on the community tightly managed. The impacts
were traffic and jobs/housing imbalance.

Council Member Morton asked staff what they thought an analysis of the
impacts of job/housing imbalance entitled.

Mr. Benest said he had no idea.

Vice Mayor Beecham said as the Council made changes to the Zoning
Ordinance, an estimate could be made as to how job potential in Palo Alto
would change. Housing potential would not change unless the City stated
what it would specifically allow.
