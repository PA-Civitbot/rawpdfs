SPECIAL ORDERS OF THE DAY

1.    Appointment of Candidates to the Utilities Advisory Commission

John Easter, 1175 Stanley Way, said the currently constituted Utilities
Advisory Commission (UAC) consisted primarily of business people. There
was a movement in the City for fiber optics. He believed one of the
appointees was someone who had technical expertise in that area and could
perhaps help City staff with the successful design, completion, and
marketing of fiber optics.

City Clerk Donna Rogers reported on the first round of votes for the Utilities
Advisory Commission:
