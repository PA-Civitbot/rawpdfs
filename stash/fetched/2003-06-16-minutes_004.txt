Mayor Mossar stated since the El Camino Park CIP projects involved Stanford
University, she would not participate in the item due to a conflict of interest
because her husband was employed by Stanford University.

Council Member Kleinberg said since the El Camino Park CIP projects
involved negotiation with Stanford University, she would not participate in
that item due to a potential conflict of interest because her husband’s former
law firm represented Stanford in land use matters.

Mayor Mossar noted that the full Council would take a vote on everything
except the Capital Improvement Project (CIP) for El Camino Park, which
would be a separate vote excluding Council Member Kleinberg and Mayor
Mossar due to conflict of interest.

Mayor Mossar requested that discussion of Item No. 11 be considered in two
parts: 11 (Part A) Adoption of 2003-05 Budget with Finance Committee
recommendations; and 11 (Part B) Future steps.
