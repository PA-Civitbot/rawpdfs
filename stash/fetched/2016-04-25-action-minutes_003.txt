Council Member Questions, Comments and Announcements

Council Member Wolbach reported his attendance at the Association of Bay
Area Governments (ABAG) General Assembly meeting last Thursday.
Housing was the primary topic covered at breakout sessions during the
meeting. He reported his attendance at a County Town Hall meeting hosted
by Santa Clara County Supervisor Joe Simitian which looked at short-term
bike and pedestrian improvements to the intersection of Page Mill Road and
Interstate 280. During the meeting he learned that the Santa Clara County
Roads and Airports Department focuses on infrastructure and is not involved
with transportation programs.
