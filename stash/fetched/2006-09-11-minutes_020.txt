public transportation becomes more available at the location.

Council Member Morton said the wording would be “achieve a 20 percent
goal” but he preferred not to remove the words “designed to achieve a 20
percent goal.”

Mayor Kleinberg asked Vice Mayor Kishimoto to clarify her incorporation.

Vice Mayor Kishimoto said she thought staff had intended to put 20 percent
instead of the 15 percent goal.

Mayor Kleinberg asked whether it needed to be voted on.

Vice Mayor Kishimoto said she did not think it needed a vote.

Mr. Emslie said the incorporation would be made.

Vice Mayor Kishimoto said her reason for the recommendation was she
understood it would take some time to achieve the 20 percent but without
enforceable language, for example, when the TDM plan says to determine
whether to have a shuttle to Caltrain, they would poll employees as to how
many people would use Caltrain. No one would use Caltrain if there were no
shuttles. The TDM plan indicated most of the TDM would be achieved by
carpooling. She said high density projects were usually located near a
transit center and she supported the project because an effort would be
made to encourage alternative transportation.

Council Member Klein said the Vice Mayor’s proposed incorporation was
accepted and was part of the main motion, and now an amendment would
be needed to vote on.

AMENDMENT: Council Member Klein moved, seconded by Mossar, to add
the words “designed to” back into the TDM mitigation measure.

AMENDMENT PASSED 5-3 Cordell, Drekmeier, Kishimoto no, Barton not
participating.

Vice Mayor Kishimoto raised concern regarding the height limitation of the
buildings. She said the plan indicated three or four buildings with heights of
70-feet and asked whether the 70-feet would be all usable space.

Mr. Williams said the maximum height of the buildings was 58 to 59 feet.
