                            MINUTES

Mayor Shepherd recommended the Council vote on the Motion.           If the
Motion passed, then the Council would discuss a date certain.

Council Member Price concurred with Council Member Scharff's comments.
As a courtesy to the authors of the original Colleague's Memorandum, it was
appropriate for them to be present for the discussion.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION: Council Member Klein moved seconded by Council
Member XXX to hear this item on April 29, 2014.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION FAILED DUE TO THE LACK OF A SECOND

Council Member Schmid inquired whether the item could be heard soon after
April 29, if the Motion passed.

Mayor Shepherd reiterated that the Council would discuss a date certain if
the Motion passed. The item would have to re-noticed.

Council Member Holman advised the Motion on the board stated "continue
the item to May 5 or later," while Mayor Shepherd indicated the Motion was
to remove the item from the April 29 Agenda.

Council Member Klein stated the item was never scheduled for April 29; the
Council was attempting to move the item to the April 29 meeting. He
recognized the courtesy Council Member Scharff requested; however,
continuing an item on the basis of Council Member attendance was a
dangerous precedent. If the Council routinely granted this type of request,
it might never accomplish its work. Many meetings were held with fewer
than nine Council Members present.

Mayor Shepherd supported Council Member Klein's comments. She would
support the Motion as a courtesy to the maker. All Council Members cared
deeply about the item.
