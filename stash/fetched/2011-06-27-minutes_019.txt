roughly 39,000 square feet of the entire site not including shared space such
as the shower or gymnasium facilities. He stated the split was 18,000 square
feet leased from the City and 21,000 from the School District. He stated the
parking was provided on surface level lots and the bulk of the parking was
on the School District side of the property and the City controlled 130 spaces
on their 8 acres. He gave a breakdown on the types of occupants who filled
the 108 buildings on the site broken down further by for-profit and non-
profit organizations. He stated the rent ranged from $0 to $1.79 per square
foot for the non-profit tenants, the rents paid by for-profit was slightly
higher up to $2.08, and the rents paid by Foothill were $2.96. The revenue
generated by hourly rentals for events such as weddings and other special
events was over $1 million. The City rents office space which attributed to
$2.5 million annually in outside income. The non-maintenance operating
expenses were approximately $2.25 million per year. There was a
considerable amount of deferred maintenance; both waiting to be addressed
as well as planned Capital Improvement Projects (CIP) over the next 25 to
30 years. The first phase of the scheduled maintenance was anticipated as
being $10 million over the next five years and then for the remainder of the
term another $6.5 million. He noted the amounts presented were anticipated
costs but the funds had not been set aside; the funding sources for the
$16.5 million had not yet been identified. He stated the City’s first phase of
the lease had completed and was currently in the first ten year option period
of the lease which expired in 2014; there needed to be notice given to the
School District of the City’s intent to renew for another five years end of
2013. The agreement entered into between the City and the School District
in the early 1980’s prescribed the following payment schedule: the annual
lease payment for the remaining 27 acres was $4.48 million, the covenant
not to develop was $1.73 million, there was a $600,000 paid for the use of
school sites for after school child care, and the utility bills were
approximately $500,000. He stated Staff was requesting direction from the
Council whether to sell or lease, the belief of maintaining maximum
flexibility was important and keeping the option to sell or lease the site to
Foothill on a long-term basis. There were relocation issues and many non-
profit and community based organizations based at the Cubberley site that
could be impacted. Parking was an issue because Foothill was requesting
1,200 stalls when the current number available was only 750. Foothill had
indicated moving forward in phases, the first phase was between 40,000 and
60,000 square feet. Foothill itself was a provider of the opportunity to
partner and create synergies with other educational community services
because they would be located amidst a variety of other learning
opportunities. He noted the loss of Foothill would be financially burdening
since they were the highest rent payer and $1 million reduced revenue
would be a significant concern. He noted if the lease option was not
extended there was a concern for the community programs if the School
District was to regain the site for public school purposes.
