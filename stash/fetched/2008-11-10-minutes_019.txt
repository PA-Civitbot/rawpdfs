better handled by the PAC. He understood the basic principle that people
like and support fountains as a rule.

Council Member Burt was not interested in this returning to Council.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to not to bring the issue back to Council for
approval.

Council Member Espinosa hoped for quick response to all that was discussed.
He asked if staff was concerned about where this ended.

Ms. Craighead stated with regard to Mitchell Park, she had a conversation
with Mr. Beasley, and that he was frustrated by the public art process.
However, she stated he would likely remain on board for the creation of a
piece for consideration at Mitchell Park.

Mayor Klein stated the PAC should not be constrained in their efforts, and
that the fountain issue was an exception.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION: Mayor Klein moved, seconded by Council Member
XXXX to adopt the replacement option.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION FAILED FOR LACK OF A SECOND.

Council Member Espinosa stated this was an unprecedented case where the
community mobilized on their thoughts and feelings on what was best for
that location.

Council Member Barton cited his concerns over the actual wording of the
petition and what community members were voicing decision upon. He did
not believe that the end decision was a true representation of the will of the
people.

Mayor Klein stated the art at Mitchell Park would be funded in part by the
One Percent For Art, and it would be referred back to the PAC in process and
would involve the public in the end.

MOTION PASSED: 7-1 Barton no, Morton abstaining
