Mayor Burt:    Our next item is a Policy and Services Committee
recommendation of adoption of an Ordinance amending the City's Minimum
Wage Ordinance to align with the Santa Clara County Cities Association's
recommendation which is to increase the minimum wage to $15 per hour in
three steps: $12 on the first of 2017, $13.50 on the first of the year on
2018, and $15 on the first of the year in 2019; and then a Consumer Price
Index increase after 2019 which would be indexed to the Bay Area
Consumer Price Index (CPI) with a five percent cap and no exemptions.
Welcome. Mr. Perez, are you kicking this off?

David Ramberg, Administrative Services Assistant Director: Good evening,
Mayor and members of the City Council. My name's David Ramberg. I'm
the Assistant Director of the Administrative Services Department. I'm going
to give you a short presentation to bring the full Council up to speed, and
then we'll kick it off to the next step. Let's see. The topics of that
presentation are included here on Slide 2. I'll jump straight into it. The first
area we want to cover is to bring you up to speed on where we currently are
with the Palo Alto minimum wage. This is a reminder and a refresh. Palo
Alto minimum wage effective January 1st of 2016 is currently $11. It's
currently scheduled to increase to approximately $11.10 on January of 2017.
That new rate must be announced by October 1st. That can be done via the
City's website. The new rate needs to be formally posted by the City on
December 1st. This next slide, four, shows you a breakdown of the different
minimum wages in sort of the immediate surrounding areas and a couple of
other areas. The most recent on this table is Los Altos. Los Altos has
adopted the $15 by 2019 minimum wage that you're hearing about tonight.
They have approved a first reading and, from what I could find out, their
second reading is going before their City Council tomorrow night. Palo Alto's
minimum wage is listed there as well. The proposal tonight that the Policy
and Services Committee unanimously forwarded to the full City Council
follows the Cities Association of Santa Clara County recommendation, which
is known as the $15 by 2019 minimum wage recommendation as a phased-
in approach, as you can see there, $12 by 2017 and so forth up to $15 by
                                                                         Page 62 of 100
