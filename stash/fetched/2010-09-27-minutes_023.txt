Council Member Klein said his reason for opposing was because it was a
unilateral disarmament of California.

MOTION PASSED: 8-1 Schmid no

Vice Mayor Espinosa suggested setting up a process that once ballot
measures were finalized, they go directly to the Policy & Services Committee
for recommendations to determine which could move forward to the Council
for action.

Mr. Keene said Staff agreed with Vice Mayor Espinosa’s request.

MOTION: Council Member Price moved, seconded by Council Member
Holman to support of Proposition 19- Regulate, Control and Tax Cannabis Act
of 2010, going to Policy & Services for discussion, and direct City Attorney to
return with a Resolution on October 4, 2010.

Council Member Price said she wanted to discuss both sides of the issue.

Council Member Holman was interested in vetting the issue and could be
informative to the community.

Mayor Burt asked the Motion be clarified.

Council Member Price said she wanted to be part of a discussion and
recommended support of Proposition 19.  The Resolution would be in
support of the Proposition.

Mayor Burt said Council Member Price’s Motion was to have the Policy &
Services Committee evaluate the proposition and to direct the City Attorney
to come back on October 4th with a Resolution in support.

Council Member Yeh said the City of Oakland currently had a local Measure
relating to cannabis and would be abstaining on the vote.

Council Member Schmid felt the proposition was a personal issue and the
Council should not take action.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION: Council Member Scharff moved, seconded by
Council Member Shepherd to refer Proposition 19- Regulate, Control and Tax
Cannabis Act of 2010 to Policy & Services Committee for discussion and any
recommendation would return to Council on October 18, 2010.
