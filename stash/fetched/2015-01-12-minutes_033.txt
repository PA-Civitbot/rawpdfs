Ms. Gitelman explained that the lead agency would respond in writing to all
comments made on the DEIR. The City would have an opportunity to review
the FEIR and ensure its comments were addressed.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to add to the end of the introductory paragraph:
“Due to the lack of mitigation of serious impacts to Palo Alto traffic, Palo Alto
opposes dedicated lanes in the City of Palo Alto. VTA should implement
suggested alternatives first”.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to move Bullet Point 20 on Page 6 of the draft
Comment Letter to Bullet Point 1.

Ms. Gitelman noted a significant difference between Alternatives 3a and 4b.
The dedicated lane in Alternative 4b almost reached the Palo Alto border.
Alternative 3a had the shortest dedicated lane. The two alternatives were
outside the City's jurisdiction.
Council Member Scharff asked why the City should be concerned about a
dedicated lane outside the City's jurisdiction. Other communities could
prefer a different alternative.

Council Member DuBois wanted to propose a specific alternative. Alternative
4b reached closest to Palo Alto's border.

Council Member Kniss advised that the City was making suggestions while
the final decision would be made by VTA and others. The City hoped its
influence would be sufficient to sway a final decision.

Council Member Wolbach felt the tone of the letter needed work.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND THE SECONDER to remove in Item 6 the sentence, “is today’s
ridership 73 percent greater than ridership in 1990? Please explain.”

Council Member Scharff asked Staff to comment on striking the question
from Item Number 6.
Mr. Rodriguez indicated it could be deleted.

Council Member Wolbach asked if the EIR adequately explored the possibility
of reducing the median along El Camino Real in order to provide space for a
dedicated bus lane, bike lane, or parking.
