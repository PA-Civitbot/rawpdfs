She stated if Staff determined the color did not match the pole, they could
require it match.

Council Member Holman noted the variety of dates on the plan pages and
the references to dual antennas. She referenced the Record of Land Use
Action statement that AT&T did not update the dates on the plans which
were revised from September. She asked what they were referring to going
forward.

Ms. French explained the date stamped on the plan at the time of
submission was the date on the ROLUA, and AT&T neglected to revise the
dates on their plans.

Council Member Holman suggested that should be clarified. She asked if
Staff considered adding a condition requiring the applicant to remove
damaged or abandoned equipment prior to issuance of new permits.

Ms. French thought it could be a part of the Master License Agreement, and
if it wasn't, it could be added to the Conditions of Approval.

Council Member Holman recalled information regarding taller antennas being
placed on City-owned infrastructure; however, AT&T stated that would not
satisfy their needs. She inquired whether Staff had an update on that issue.

Mr. Williams answered Staff would have to determine if that was viable, and
Staff had informed AT&T about this issue. He indicated AT&T's response was
that there were constraints that prevented use of taller antennas, but it
would continue to evaluate this issue as it moved forward with the program.
He did not feel it was an alternative for the proposed 20 antennas especially
given the timeframe.

Council Member Holman asked if some of the fans operated continuously.

Ms. French indicated their impression was that fans would operate as needed
to prevent overheating.

Council Member Shepherd inquired if the utility poles were owned jointly by
the Palo Alto Utilities and AT&T.

Ms. French answered yes.
