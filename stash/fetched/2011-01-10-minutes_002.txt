Simultaneous with the SCS process, the latest update of the Regional
Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA), prepared by ABAG, is scheduled to take
place at the regional level. Cities and counties may also opt to develop the
RHNA for their communities at a subregional level. Participation at a
subregional level is being considered by the cities in Santa Clara County and
a decision was required by the group no later than March. Staff outlined to
the Council the schedule of items for the planning and housing efforts
through 2011, and indicated that report updates would be presented
approximately monthly, as well as items for action as needed. Mr. Williams
also noted that it appeared likely that Councilmember Scharff would be
appointed to the RHNA Methodology Committee.

The Council offered a number of questions and suggestions related to:
     the unrealistic timeline

     the inadequacy of representation of the City and the county on
      regional committees

     whether the economic forecasts account for the unique nature of Santa
      Clara County and the Silicon Valley's economy

     the lack of school (and other infrastructure) financing

     the need to tie housing production to transportation funding

     looking at 21st century growth, and factors such as rail service and
      wireless communications (telecommuting)

     partnerships with schools

     concerns about exemptions from CEQA that wouldn't              allow   a
      community to address environmental issues like traffic

     how the SCS would relate to a city's Comprehensive Plan

     identification of what is needed to sustain the economy across the
      region

     the need to look at downtown as compatible with the SCS objectives,
      but it is not included on the list of PDAs

     the need to do more than just "tweak" the RHNA numbers

     what happens if Caltrain fails, noting that MTC has not had a historical
      commitment to Caltrain

     the thin relationship between vehicle-miles-traveled (VMT) and
      greenhouse gases (GHG) and noting that SB375 would reduce GHG
      from cars by only 0.4%
