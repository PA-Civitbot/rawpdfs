Council Member Burt: Oh, you would. I see. So be it then.

Council Member Wolbach: Though I'm not accepting it as an amendment, I
...

Mayor Holman: No. Council Member Wolbach, you were not called on. The
process is—I'm sorry, but it's late and we've got to get through this. You
didn't accept it. Council Member Burt ...

Council Member Burt: It's out there, good enough.

Mayor Holman: ... if you offered it as a separate amendment, I will second
it.

Council Member Burt: Okay.

Mayor Holman: Then the discussion is about that. I'm sorry to be rude, but
we've got to get through this. People can't just chime in.

AMENDMENT TO THE AMENDMENT:                  Council Member Burt moved,
seconded by Mayor Holman to add to the Amendment, “The VTA
prioritization process should support proportional support for workers and
their needs to reach their employment locations.”

Council Member DuBois: Don't we get a chance to turn it down first?

Council Member Burt: No, you (crosstalk).

Mayor Holman: You get to comment on this amendment, yes.

Council Member Kniss: Mayor, just before we vote though, how does this
change what Cory did?

Council Member Berman: It will be an add-on to that.

Mayor Holman: Yes.

Council Member Kniss: An add-on in what way?

Mayor Holman: it would become a part of that amendment.

Council Member Kniss: it simply becomes an addendum to what we send in
as our priorities?
