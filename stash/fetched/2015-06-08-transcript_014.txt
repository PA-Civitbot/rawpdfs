primarily due to change in reappropriating funds between fiscal years,
whereby $51 million of unspent funds are carried forward through the
budget process from Fiscal Year 2015 to Fiscal Year 2016. The salary and
benefit changes are consistent with compensation increases granted by the
Council through approval of Memoranda of Understandings and
compensation plans for our employee groups as well as some increases in
positions in support of Council direction and priorities. The Fiscal Year 2016
Capital Budget as recommended by the Finance Committee totals $124.6
million. It has more than doubled, increasing by $67 million from 57.5 to
$124.6 million, primarily due to the change in reappropriating unspent funds
from the current fiscal year to Fiscal Year 2016.            The majority of
expenditures in the Enterprise Internal Service Funds, which represent about
two-thirds of the entire Capital Budget, are proposed for the rehabilitation
and repair of existing infrastructure. The Capital Improvement Fund and
Cubberley Fund, representing the blue part of the chart, comprise
approximately 38 percent of the City's overall 2016 Capital Budget of 47
million. Both of these funds are primarily supported by transfers from the
General Fund. Focusing my discussion on the Capital Improvement Fund for
the next five years, planned expenditures in the Fiscal Year 2016-2020
proposed revised Capital Improvement Program of 252 million are
approximately 140 million higher than last year's five-year program. The
increase is primarily attributable to two factors.         First, due to the
reappropriation change for Fiscal Year 2016, the budget increased by 51
million in comparison to this year's budget. The second and more significant
driver of the increased expenditure level is the inclusion of the $126 million
Infrastructure Plan the City Council approved in June last year, which is
primarily reflected in the blue bar representing the buildings and facilities
category and the purple bar representing the traffic and transportation
category. With the additional staffing resources as proposed in this budget,
Staff is committed to implementing the Infrastructure Plan. Before we
discuss in detail the General Fund Budget, I would like to quickly speak to
increases in rates for the City's utility customers. This budget includes rate
increases for water, as we just heard, wastewater, refuse collection and
storm drain. Additionally for the City's fiber optics customers, the rate will
increase by 2.7 percent, which is equivalent to the Consumer Price Index
adjustment as contractually agreed between the City and its customers. As
recommended by the Finance Committee and Staff, the General Fund has a
surplus of approximately $600,000 for Fiscal Year 2016 with a projected
Budget Stabilization Reserve balance of 34.9 million or 18.8 percent, which
is above the 18.5 percent target level. The General Fund revenues include
184 million in revenues and the 2.1 million carried forward of Fiscal Year
2015 budget surplus. These total revenues cover the $185.5 million in
expenditures and result in the aforementioned $600,000 budget surplus for
Fiscal Year 2016. As noted in the Budget Adoption Memorandum, the Fiscal
                                                                        Page 14 of 81
