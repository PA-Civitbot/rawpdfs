Vice Mayor Schmid: I guess if you put that in the motion, it's PTC C-3.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to add to the Motion Part C, “C3” after “PTC.”
Vice Mayor Schmid: Number 4, Planning for the Future, is not new. Isn't it
the PTC Number 4?

Council Member DuBois: Yeah. That's more consistent.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to replace in the Motion Part D, “new” with “PTC
C4.”
Vice Mayor Schmid: Then the C-5, Health and Well-being, is not new. It's
actually PTC Goal Number 1, adding a second sentence on it. Is that right?
Okay, that's helpful.

Mayor Holman: Hang on just for a second here. Let's see if David's got
that. Also clarification for me. The PTC Goal 1, you've got improve quality,
but what I see under PTC Goal 1, under health and well being, is prioritize
implementation of programs and strategies. I'm unclear where the language
is coming from that's in the original motion. Council Member DuBois, and
kind of responding to ...

Ms. Gitelman: Mayor Holman, if I could interject. I think Council Member
Wolbach added some language and we just picked up a little too much in
that Part E about C-5. If we just started with "particularly for children,
youth, seniors, unhoused," it would work with the existing PTC Goal C-1 as a
qualifier. See what I mean? The text that David's just highlighted. If we
struck that, I think it would achieve what Council Member Wolbach was
looking for which is reference to these particular groups in the PTC goal
about helping (crosstalk).

Mayor Holman: Council Member Wolbach is shaking his head no.

Council Member Wolbach: May I respond to this?

Mayor Holman: Yeah.

Council Member Wolbach:         That specific language that's highlighted,
"improving the quality, quantity and affordability of social services," is not in
the new C-1. It's not in the PTC C-1. I don't see that wording there. That's
why I asked for that to be carried over and the maker and seconder
approved of carrying over that language. Unless there's something I'm
missing there.
