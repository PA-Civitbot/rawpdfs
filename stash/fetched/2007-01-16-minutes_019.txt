Mayor Kishimoto reported she has requested that the report and bids for
fiber to the home project be transmitted to the Council a week prior to the
scheduled Council Meeting of February 20, 2007. She also proposed a sub-
committee of the Council be appointed by the mayor to advise the Council
on this matter.

Council Member Cordell requested the meeting that evening be adjourned in
memory of Dr. Martin Luther Jr. and Coretta Scott King. She reflected on
the poignant and ever so relevant words he spoke on April 14, 1967, at
Stanford University Memorial Auditorium: “It may well be that we will have
to repent in this generation, not merely for the vitriolic words of the bad
people and the violent actions of the bad people, but for the appalling silence
and indifference of the good people, who sit around and say “wait on time.”
Somewhere, we must come to see that social progress never rolls in on the
wheels of inevitability. It comes through the tireless efforts and the
persistent work of dedicated individuals and, without this hard work time
itself becomes an ally of the primitive forces of social stagnation. So, we
must help time. We must realize that the time is always right to do right.”
