Council Member Kniss: No.

Mayor Burt: Council Member Holman?

Council Member Holman: No, other than to say, as Chair Filseth said, this is
the second year of a two-year plan. In case anybody should think that we
have discretion to add money to the pot, we don't. It's CDBG funds; that's
why I think it's appropriate to move this forward.

Mayor Burt: Please vote on the board.        That passes 8-0 with Council
Member Schmid absent.

MOTION PASSED: 8-0 Schmid not participating

Council Member Schmid returned to the meeting at 6:53 P.M.

     Addresses on Loma Verde Avenue, Addresses 984-1058; Even and

Mayor Burt: Our next item is titled as Item Number 8. It's a public hearing
that's a continuation of this item from last week which is a single story
overlay for Royal Manor Tract. I want to say at the outset that we had
members who had filled out speaker cardsâ€”Council Member Wolbach, did
you wish to...

Council Member Wolbach: Yes. I think I'm probably not alone. Because I
live right in the middle of the Royal Manor subdivision, I will be recusing
myself from this discussion.

Mayor Burt: Council Member Schmid.
