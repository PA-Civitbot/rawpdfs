Vice Mayor Morton said with respect to recommendations (B) through (I) in
the Executive Summary Report, the Council could request Staff to provide
the costs and challenges that involved the northern versus the southern
location.

Council Member Kishimoto asked for the size of the land south of the landfill
and what would it take to smooth out the landscaping.

Mr. Bobel said a review of the existing plan would need to take place to stay
within the engineering guidelines.

Ms. Renzel said everything including the sewage treatment plant was landfill.
The Water Quality Control rules required certain slopes to eliminate standing
water in the landfill. The steep slopes made the land difficult for park use.

Council Member Burt asked what the cost would be in the trade off between
using an aerated static pile for a few years before moving into a long-term
anaerobic digestion system.

Mr. Bobel said he did not have an answer.

Mr. Wenzlau said the BRTF felt there were more reasons for the interim
solution rather than introduce a new technology. It accomplished getting
the permit and having the City maintain the expertise in composting.

Council Member Yeh asked who owned the 3.6 acres as indicated in Staff
Report CMR:402:09, 2021 Location Screening, Appendix D-4.

Mr. Bobel said it was privately owned.

Council Member Yeh asked if the sale price was known.

Mr. Bobel said he did not have the total dollar amount for the three
buildings. The middle building sold for half-a-million dollars, but did not
know the sale price on the other two buildings. He estimated $10,000,000.

Stanley Peters, Menlo Park, spoke regarding the safety issues of moving a
landfill closer to an airport runway and how it would increase the risk and
frequency of damaging events. He said safety as well as cost should be
taken into consideration in making a decision.
