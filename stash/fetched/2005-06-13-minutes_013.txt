MOTION: Council Member Ojakian moved, seconded by Freeman, to deny
the staff recommendation and direct staff to report back to the Council in
one year on the effects of the impacts on the ban of leaf blowers.

Council Member Ojakian said 98 percent of 200 pieces of communication
received by the Council asked that the ban on leaf blowers not be extended.

Council Member Morton said the particulate and noise problems had not
been solved.

Mayor Burch said a greater service to the gardeners and the residents would
be accomplished by banning all leaf blowers.

Vice Mayor Kleinberg said a step needed to be taken in the direction
suggested by the health organizations.

MOTION PASSED 7-1, Beecham no, Mossar absent.

COUNCIL MATTERS

9.   Colleagues Memo from Mayor Burch and Council Members Ojakian and
     Council Member Kishimoto re: Proposal to Allow Council Members to
     Serve One Additional Four-Year Term

Mayor Burch asked the Council’s consent to agendize the proposal for full
discussion and requested the City Attorney to prepare documentation and
return on July 11, 2005, at which time the decision would be made whether
to place it on the November 2005 ballot.

Council Member Cordell asked what action would be taken between that
evening and the next time the item would return to the Council.

Mayor Burch said no action would be taken. The City Attorney would return
with the ballot statement.

Council Member Cordell said the size of the Council should be determined
prior to a decision on extending the Council Member’s term limits.

Council Member Beecham said the community had not come forward asking
for the Council’s term limits to be extended.

Council Member Ojakian said the issue was internal to the Council and how it
would function over a period of time.

Council Member Freeman said she did not feel any more time should be
spent on the item; longer terms did not serve any purpose.
