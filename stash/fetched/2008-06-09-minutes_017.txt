within prior Council review. He stated there were four new Council Members
that had not seen the previous goals set.

Ms. Lund stated the developmental goals set last year were part of the self-
evaluation, listed in the self-assessment, with each CAO responding to how
he or she felt they had accomplished them.

Mayor Klein thought this to be contrary to prior procedure. He stated Council
usually received a binder with all of the evaluations from the prior year. He
asked whether that process had changed.

Ms. Lund stated she would accommodate the procedure.

Council Member Burt asked whether there was typically a reporting of the
amount of time spent for professional development.

Council Member Barton stated this had not been formally done during his
tenure on the Council.

Council Member Burt asked whether it had been informal.

Council Member Barton thought the CAO’s, in their self-evaluation and in the
narrative of the work, discussed their accomplishments in relationship to
their goals.

Council Member Burt requested a summary on an annual basis, for the
professional development and the amount of time spent on each goal.

MOTION: Council Member Burt moved, seconded by Council Member
Schmid to approve the CAO Evaluation Forms to include time spent on
professional development offsite.

Council Member Morton stated prior years evaluations needed only be
mentioned in reference to the goals that were set and their
accomplishments.

Council Member Espinosa asked for clarification on the Motion.

Council Member Burt stated the goal was to be informed as to how the
CAO’s accomplished their goals and at what level that assisted them in their
job function.

MOTION PASSED: 8-1 Barton no
