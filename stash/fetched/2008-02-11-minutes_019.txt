Mayor Klein asked if the intention of the Amendment was to delay the COP
issuance.

Council Member Morton responded no.

Mayor Klein clarified that the intent was for an election for the 9-1-1 and
Business License Tax that had nothing to do COP’s.

Council Member Morton replied that he thought with the COP’s it was
necessary to identify sources of revenue.

Council Member Burt retracted his second to the Amendment.

City Attorney Gary Baum stated that if the revenue measures were linked to
the COP’s, a 66.6 percent approval would be required in a special tax.

Mayor Klein stated the Amendment was separate direction to staff to
proceed with an election on the Business License and 9-1-1 Tax. Either there
was a connection with the COP’S or not.

Mr. Baum stated that it could be a Substitute Motion or Council could choose
to divide it for the purpose of voting.

Mayor Klein stated he chose to divide it because he didn’t think that it was
an Amendment to the Motion.

Council Member Morton asked Mr. Baum if it was his choice to offer it as an
Amendment. He could not support the COP’s without assurance that the
impact on General Fund is minimized.

Mr. Baum stated that decisions on the Motions were the decision of the
Mayor unless he is overruled by the majority of the Council.

Council Member Morton requested that the Amendment not be divided.

Council Member Schmid stated his understanding that sequentially the
decision on COP’s must be made by April.

City Clerk Donna Grider stated that for a November election the decision to
place a measure on the ballot must be approved by the end of July.

Council Member Schmid stated that the decision can still be made in April.

Mayor Klein responded that would be another Amendment.
