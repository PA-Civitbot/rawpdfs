and the sound and stuff like that. If the total pool of money that's expended
by a restaurant can't be on their own initiation shared with the back-of-
house staff, the light and sound crews, then we're hurting them. I can't
support the Substitute Motion.

Mayor Burt: Council Member Schmid.

Council Member Schmid: Just briefly, I think what we're talking about is
very important. I agree with the comments just made. I think it is
important also that there be time to adapt to an important change. I
thought the discussion that took place in the Policy and Services Committee
was effective in making that point, that we're doing this not just by
ourselves but as part of a regional movement in association with the Cities
Association. I would vote against the substitute Motion.

Mayor Burt: I will reserve most of my comments until and if we return to
the main Motion, except to say that I think we need to be as conscious as
possible about what are the intended outcomes that we were seeking from
the outset from this initiative and what unintended consequences may occur
that we have to try to understand and address. I will not be supporting the
substitute Motion. Please vote on the board. That fails on a 7-2 vote with
Council Members Wolbach and Berman voting yes.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION AS AMENDED RESTATED:                  Council Member
Wolbach moved, seconded by Council Member Berman to adopt an
Ordinance amending the City’s Minimum Wage Ordinance to increase the
minimum wage to $15.00 per hour in three steps: $12.00 on April 1, 2017;
$13.50 on January 1, 2018, $15.00 on July 1, 2018, and a Consumer Price
Index (CPI) increase after 2019 indexed to the Bay Area CPI with a 5
percent cap and no exemptions and direct the Policy and Services
Committee to evaluate the concept of a tipped worker exemption and the
impacts of advocating for this concept in Sacramento.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION AS AMENDED FAILED: 2-7 Berman, Wolbach, yes

MOTION RESTATED: Council Member DuBois moved, seconded by Council
Member Kniss to adopt an Ordinance amending the City’s Minimum Wage
Ordinance to align with the Cities Association recommendation to increase
the minimum wage to $15.00 per hour in three steps: $12.00 on January 1,
2017; $13.50 on January 1, 2018, $15.00 on January 1, 2019, and a
Consumer Price Index (CPI) increase after 2019 indexed to the Bay Area CPI
with a 5 percent cap and no exemptions and commit to updating the City’s
Ordinance to exclude tipped employees if Labor Code Section 351 is updated
to allow this exemption and the City will support advocating for this
exemption at the state level.
