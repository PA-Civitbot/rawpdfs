Ariella Sherstinsky, 4162 King Arthur Court, said she supported the project.
The homes would improve the appearance and blend with the neighborhood.

Bob Moss, 4010 Orme Street, said the P&TC should be supported. The only
cul-de-sac similar to the current project was Julie Court, which was imposed
on Barron Park 35 years prior by the County.

Council Member Morton asked Mr. Moss what was offensive about Julie
Court.

Mr. Moss said Julie Court was narrow and had inadequate parking for guests
whose cars spilled over onto Matadero Avenue.

Council Member Morton asked about guests visiting homes on Matadero
Avenue and whether parking spilled out.

Mr. Moss said Julie Court had a problem because of the parking issue.

Ralph Osterling, 1650 Borel Place, San Mateo, said the riparian corridor and
the associated values were thoroughly protected. The health of the trees
and the weeds after the rain on the property indicated there was not a
pesticide problem in the soil.

Prasad Parimi said headlights from cars coming out of the cul-de-sac would
be directed toward his house.

Zina Kaganovich, 706 La Para Avenue, said Mark Migdal built beautiful
homes and supported his plan.

Lubov Valetsky, 788 Encina Grande Drive, asked the Council to support the
proposed subdivision.

Owen Byrd, 418 Florence Street, said the additional conditions proposed by
staff regarding architectural review and soil testing was agreeable with
them. The architectural review process would deliver homes of sufficient
architectural variety to serve the neighborhood.       There had not been
evidence introduced that the habitat of the riparian corridor was at risk. He
asked that the project be approved.

Vice Mayor Burch said there was reference to four and five bedrooms.

Mr. Byrd said what Vice Mayor Burch was looking at was a two-dimensional
subdivision map. The rooms in the homes were issues to be addressed in
the future.
