Council Member Cordell asked whether it would be considered a danger or
hazard.

Mr. Baum replied there would be a safety aspect for emergency or for
transportation.

Council Member Cordell asked if the potential hazard of not having sidewalk
use in an emergency was the criteria that would make the Sit/Lie Ordinance
valid.

Mr. Baum stated that was correct and he stated that cases and the analysis
referred to a governmental interest that included the safety and convenience
of the public in commercial areas during certain times.

Council Member Cordell asked whether congregating in front of a building,
which would detour people from going into the building, would validate such
an Ordinance.

Mr. Baum replied the constitution allowed people to walk in the street and
not be stopped by someone sitting or lying on the pavement.

Juliene Williams, AIW, 801 High Street, stated she supported the Ordinance.
She had been told by many potential customers of her business that they
would not shop there because of the constant panhandling in front of her
business.

Eileen Richardson, 773 East Meadow, stated she supported expanding the
Sit/Lie Ordinance. It would encourage the un-housed to get help, which
would be of greater value than panhandling to get cash.

Leland Alton, 313 Encina Avenue, stated he could not stand for long periods
of time and he would not support the expansion of the Ordinance.

Christiane Cook, 1234 Emerson, stated the City had no compassion for the
homeless and she would not support the Ordinance.

Bunny Good, P.O. Box 824, Menlo Park, stated people with money used to
give to public works projects. She asked where all the money had gone and
she would not support this Ordinance.

Susan Richardson, P.O. Box 1035, stated she believed the Ordinance was
made to protect business owners and she would not support it.
