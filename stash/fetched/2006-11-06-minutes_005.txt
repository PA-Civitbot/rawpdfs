CONSENT CALENDAR


Council Member Klein said he was advised by staff not to participate on Item
No. 2 since this item was the Community Commercial (CC) zoning district,
which includes Stanford lands and his wife is employed by Stanford
University.

Council Member Cordell said reference was made to the Stanford Shopping
Center in Item No. 2, page 3.

Planning and Community Environment Director Steve Emslie confirmed the
two items were separated because Item No. 2 had a Stanford conflict and
Item No. 3 did not.

City Attorney Baum confirmed there was a Stanford conflict in Item No. 2.

Council Member Mossar said she would not participate in Item No. 2 but
noted the ordinance wording in Item No. 2 had been revised since the first
review by the Council. She asked whether the change pertained to Item No.
3.

Mr. Emslie said the change pertained to the Community Commercial (CC)
Zoning District, as it affected Town and Country Village Shopping Center
only.   Staff had mischaracterized the transmittal of the Planning and
Transportation Commission (P&TC) recommendation. The P&TC changes
were made and it was recommended the Council remove Item No. 2 and re-
notice as a public hearing.

Council Member Mossar asked to remove Item No. 2 because although both
the Town and Country Village Shopping Center and Stanford Shopping
Center had CC zoning, the change only pertained to the Town and Country
Village Shopping Center.

Mr. Baum asked if Item No. 2 was separated when it was first before
Council.

Mr. Emslie said it was but he would check on exactly how the issue was
