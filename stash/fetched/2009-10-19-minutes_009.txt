the language was because it was not really when the landfill closed. It
would be when acceptance of garbage ceased, but still accepted the yard
trimmings for six months in order to get enough compost for the final cover.
It was accurate to say that it would be in the beginning of 2012 when yard
waste no longer would be accepted at the compost facility and required an
alternative home.

Mayor Drekmeier asked if the anaerobic process entailed getting a new
permit.

Mr. Bobel said it would.

Mayor Drekmeier asked whether the Calaveras Fund could be used for the
anaerobic digestion facility.

Mr. Bobel said he could not provide the answer since it was not within the
expertise of the BRTF members.

Mayor Drekmeier asked whether an economic evaluation was completed.

Mr. Bobel said he felt an economic evaluation would require the expertise of
a consultant.

Mayor Drekmeier asked what the feasibility was in reshaping the landfill to
create six acres of flat space.

Hilary Gans, BRTF member said it would require an engineering study, but
could be done with the existing equipment currently on the site.

Mayor Drekmeier asked Staff for feedback regarding the middle and final
step of aerated static piles and the anaerobic process.

Mr. Bobel said the BRTF had analyzed the technology and concluded the next
step would be the aerated static pile. The current and most favorable in the
market was the dry Advance Anaerobic Digestion (AAD). The safest route to
take would be to move forward with one step but not both at the same time.

Mayor Drekmeier asked if it was a timing or financial issue.

Mr. Bobel said it was both.    The aerated static pile could be used as an
integrated part of the AAD.
