Francisco was about half complete; and the tunnel project from Fremont to
Menlo Park had completed construction across three earthquake zones.

Council Member Holman noted review of the Master Plan for wireless
distribution was scheduled for February 21, 2012, and two Council Members
would be absent on that date. She asked if there was an alternate date for
this review, as she felt all Council Members should be present for that
discussion.

City Attorney, Molly Stump, responded based on earlier discussions with Mr.
Williams, she did not feel there was an intention to present a Master Plan on
that date. She thought February 21 was a follow-up to the study session.

Council Member Holman expressed interest in providing input on the topic.

ADJOURNMENT: The meeting was adjourned at 11:18 P.M.
