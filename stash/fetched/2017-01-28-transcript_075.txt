Mayor Scharff: All in favor.

MOTION PASSED: 8-0 Kniss absent

Mayor Scharff:   Can we have a Motion to adjourn then?        Did you have
something?

Mr. Keene: Only one thing, Mr. Mayor. We have a set date, as the Mayor
said, for the second Retreat. It is on a Wednesday and a Thursday.
Between now and the end of April, these were the only two dates that we
could get, that were even remotely working. I want to be able to confirm
with our facilitators, who we're bringing in, that those are the dates we're
going to have. That's the understanding. A governance Retreat just like
this one in particular really needs to have everybody in attendance.

Mayor Scharff: Karen.

Council Member Holman: Remind me of the hours. It was a Wednesday
afternoon and a Thursday day. How's the public going to participate?

Mr. Keene: They're going to come in the daytime. There's a lot of people
who can come in the daytime, who can't come at night.

4.    Wrap-up and Next Steps.

Mayor Scharff: With that, meeting's adjourned.

Adjournment: The meeting was adjourned at 1:58 P.M.
