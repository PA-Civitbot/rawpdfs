Council Member Mossar said the hiring practices had changed. Senior
staff was being hired as “at will” employees, which meant they did not
have any rights to their job and could be terminated at any time. It
attracted top-notch people giving management the flexibility to run the
organization in the best way possible. The City would not be burdened
with long-term employees not carrying their weight. In exchange,
besides having the financial incentive to compensate for the high-
priced housing market, a good financial offer would need to be made
to have an individual take the risk to relocate knowing they could be
terminated and not have any rights to appeal.

MOTION PASSED 7-1, Freeman no, Kishimoto absent.

Council Member Freeman clarified she approved of Mr. Carlsen, but
her “no” vote was based on the financial situation surrounding his
appointment.

Council Member Beecham stated the action was the appointment of
the individual.

Mr. Benest introduced Mr. Carlsen and said he had a Master’s Degree
in Management and Human Resources from the University of Redlands
and a Bachelor’s Degree from the University of Washington, extensive
management experience both in the public and private sector, he was
a former city manager and served as interim city manager and interim
department head in a number of cities. Mr. Carlsen’s appointment was
based on his outstanding performance as the City’s Interim Human
Resources Director for the past several months.

Mr. Russ Carlsen thanked the Council and stated it was a privilege to
be part of the City.
