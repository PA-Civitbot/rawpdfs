Mayor Mossar said for the record, the then sitting Council Members
participated in the process.

Council Member Lytle asked who would support the Blue Ribbon panel of
experts for the professional recruitment portion.

Vice Mayor Beecham questioned if Council Member Lytleâ€™s question was
whether internal staff would be helping in the process.

Council Member Lytle questioned if the Human Resource Department would
be working on the hiring or an outside professional recruiter.

Council Member Kleinberg said a temporary individual would work in City
Hall or with the chair of the CAO Committee.

Council Member Lytle said she wanted the outreach recruitment to be in the
best possible area of professional support to attract the best candidates.

Mayor Mossar clarified that Council Member Lytle suggested that a
professional recruiter be hired in addition to the Blue Ribbon panel.

Council Member Lytle said yes.

Council Member Kleinberg said only a small unique outreach group would be
easily identified through selected targets.

Mayor Mossar questioned how limited the outreach group would be and
asked who would help with writing the job description for the City Attorney
position.

Council Member Kishimoto said she believed that a professional should be
hired to help with the recruitment, screening, and negotiating.

Council Member Morton said he would be uncomfortable transferring the
interviewing and oversight to a panel and felt outside assistance would be
needed.

Mayor Mossar said before the vote, the             motion   would   be   the
recommendation to hire professional expertise.

Vice Mayor Beecham said in order for the right individuals to apply, the
individuals should be satisfied with their current job and also they would be
willing to take a chance and come to Palo Alto.
