Council Member Price advised she would not be participating in
Recommendation Number 4 of Agenda Item No. 1 due to her business
relationship with Turner Construction.

Senior Assistant City Attorney, Cara Silver said when a portion of an Agenda
item was conflicted, the Fair Political Practices Commission (FPPC) required
the conflicted portion be bifurcated, discussed, and voted on separately.
Council Member Price could not participate on the bifurcated portion but it
was not necessary that she recuse herself from the entire discussion of the
item.

Public Works Director, Glenn Roberts opened the presentation with a brief
description of Staffâ€™s recommendations outlined in Staff Report CMR:334:10.
He said upon approval of the recommendations, two project-related
activities would take place. The entire project site would be fenced off prior
to the beginning of the school year and a 14-day notice regarding the
removal of trees would be posted prior to fencing off the site. The process
for removing the trees had gone through an open-vetted public process and
an Environmental Impact Review (EIR).

Library Director, Diane Jennings said the project would be an incredible
change to the library system and the community. She said a Stakeholders
Committee was formed after the Bond Measure was passed that provided
guidance and advice in making the project a success. The Palo Alto Library
Foundation continued to raise funds in support of the new facilities. She
thanked the people, community and Staff for their efforts in being
instrumental in promoting the project.
