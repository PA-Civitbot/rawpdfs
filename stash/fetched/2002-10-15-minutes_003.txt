8.   CMR:385:02 PUBLIC HEARING: The City Council will consider
     amendments to the vehicle and equipment storage and repair
     provisions of Palo Alto Municipal Code section 18.88.160.
     The existing section does not contain specific restrictions
     in residential zones on storage of vehicles on unpaved
     surfaces, visibility triangles, and front yards and does
     not restrict hours of outdoor screened vehicle repair. The
     amendments to be considered would restrict the parking of
     vehicles on unpaved surfaces, visibility triangles, and
     front yards and would restrict outdoor screened vehicle
     repair to between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. The
     amendments to be considered also would clarify the penalty
     provisions of the section.

     Ordinance of the Council of the City of Palo Alto Amending
     Palo Alto Municipal Code Section 18.88.160 Pertaining to
     Vehicle Equipment Repair and Storage
