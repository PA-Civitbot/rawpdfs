CONSENT CALENDAR

MOTION: Council Member Morton moved, seconded by Mossar, to approve
Item Nos. 4-9 on the Consent Calendar.

Council Member Freeman moved that Item No. 5 be removed from the
Consent Calendar. There was no second.

Council Member Freeman moved that Item No. 8 be removed from the
Consent Calendar. There was no second.

Council Member Freeman asked regarding Item No. 6, why the 33-month
extension on the maintenance agreement with MBA of California, Inc. for
copiers did not go out for bid.

Director of Administrative Services Carl Yeats said staff decided to utilize the
contract’s provision for extension of service.

Council Member Freeman said it was not noted in the staff report (CMR
397:05) and needed clarification.

Mr. Yeats said he would verify.

Council Member Freeman stated she would be voting “no” on Item Nos. 5, 6
and 8.
