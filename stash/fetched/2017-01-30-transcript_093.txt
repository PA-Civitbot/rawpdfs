Ms. Gitelman: Yeah. The Council could keep Program L-9.4.1.

Council Member Holman: Which I cannot find.

Mayor Scharff: Could we have the Motion back up there?

Ms. Gitelman: Packet Page 98.

Council Member DuBois: Packet Page 229. The policy there is very general.

Mayor Scharff: Packet Page what?

Council Member DuBois: Page 229, at the top.

Council Member Holman: I'm not sure that L-9.4.1 is—it doesn't address
some of the things that are addressed in the policy. If we could make the
policy, 4.10, a program so it's not so directive but includes more of the
conditions.

Mayor Scharff:    Council Member Holman, you need to make—it's your
Motion, right?

Council Member Holman: I think it was Council Member DuBois' Motion. I
seconded it, I do believe.

Mayor Scharff:   It's Council Member DuBois, seconded by Council Member
Holman.

Council Member DuBois: That's the program, that one I pointed you to. It
is kind of split a little bit oddly.

Council Member Holman: My suggestion would be then to convert Policy L-
4.10 to a program. I'm wondering if you would accept that. It includes, like
I said—I don't need to repeat myself.

Council Member DuBois: That's acceptable to me.

MOTION: Council Member DuBois moved, seconded by Council Member
Holman to direct Staff to include in the final draft of the Comprehensive Plan
Update converting Policy L-4.10 regarding enhancing the pedestrian
environment along El Camino Real to a Program and maintain Program L-
9.4.1 specific to sidewalk widths and building design.

Council Member Holman: Thanks.
