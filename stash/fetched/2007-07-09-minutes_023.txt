Council Member Drekmeier felt it was a gift to the community for the
Environmental Volunteers to want to take over the project.

MOTION: Council Member Drekmeier moved, seconded by Barton, to
approve staff recommendation to: 1) authorize the City Manager to execute
the Option to Lease Agreement with the Environmental Volunteers (EV); and
2) waive certain City processing fees for the project in accordance with
Policy & Procedures 1-25, Public/Private Partnerships.

Council Member Morton asked whether there was concern for additional
costs for the building upgrades due to it being in the flight path.

Maryanne Welton said the additional costs would be for insulation and STC
rated windows and the FAA had programs available to assist in the funding.

Council Member Morton asked whether the building being in the flight path
caused issues.

Ms. Welton stated the map was incorrect and the building was not in the
flight path. The maps had not been updated.

Allan Berkowitz requested that the Transfer Development Rights (TDR) be
applied to the projectâ€™s capital improvement costs.

Mayor Kishimoto asked the cost of the TDR.

Manager of Real Property Bill Fellman said $237,500.

Council Member Drekmeier suggested an amendment to apply TDR for
project capital improvement and construction costs.

INCORPORATED INTO MOTION WITH CONSENT OF MAKER AND
SECONDER: to allow Transfer Development Rights to apply to project
capital costs.

Council Member Barton asked why the TDRs were removed from the lease
option.

Mr. Fellman said the TDR was not in the lease or option. It was in the CMR
stating it would be held over for use on any City building.

Vice Mayor Klein asked for explanation of the TDR policy.
