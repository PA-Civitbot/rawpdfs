            DRAFT ACTION MINUTES
Vice Mayor Kniss believed the Council would always choose an integrated
approach over a piecemeal approach. The ability to proceed quickly was
important.

Council Member Berman remarked that the net employee demand would
decrease based on implementation of different parking strategies. Under the
RPP Program, many commuters would not have a parking space. The
Council had a responsibility to address the consequences of its decisions.

Council Member Holman noted the numbers in the table did not represent
new demand. She inquired about the next strategy Staff would present to
the Council.

Ms. Gitelman advised that in late September 2014 Staff would return with a
discussion of parking supply strategies or new garages.

Council Member Holman requested Staff provide an informational report
regarding the schedule of the business registry. The Council needed that
information to understand the density of office occupancy.

Mr. Keene would work with the Mayor on scheduling that topic.
