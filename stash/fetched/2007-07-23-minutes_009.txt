Deputy Director of Administrative Services Joe Saccio stated that any actions
taken would not impose any financial or legal obligations on the part of the
City or the ABAG Finance Authority. The Council was being asked to approve
three resolutions: 1) to be a member of the ABAG Finance Authority; 2) an
approval of a bond issue to build a community center; 3) an approval of a
bond issue to build a retirement community.

Council Member Cordell asked for clarification that the City would have no
liability but was still required to be a part of this.

Mr. Saccio stated that she was correct; there was a requirement and Federal

Council Member Cordell asked whether the County approved this.

Mr. Saccio stated that was correct.

Council Member Cordell asked for clarification that the Council was being
asked to approve the Resolutions with no obligation.

City Attorney Gary Baum stated this was relatively common and the purpose
was to ensure that there was a public purpose with a non-profit and the
public had an opportunity to comment on it.

the construction of the Albert L. Schultz Jewish Community Center and a
