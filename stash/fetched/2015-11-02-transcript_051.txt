really important. When I was on the board, one of the things that one of the
adults that had a house that was provided by Housing Choices Coalition said
to me—I asked him, "What is the most important thing to you when you
have this house?" The answer was privacy, "I have privacy." It's precious;
we take it for granted. We don't know what it's like for an adult to live with
Mom and Dad. Thank you.

Mayor Holman: Thank you. Thank you to everyone who came this evening
and for your comments and interest in this topic.

Mr. Hirsch: Point of order please, Madam Mayor. I understand you closed
the meeting when one person wanted to put in a—is it lawful to actually
close the public hearing ...

Mayor Holman: Mr. Hirsch?

Mr. Hirsch: ... while it's going on?

Mayor Holman: You've had your time to speak.

Mr. Hirsch: I'm talking about a point of order with regard to process, where
one person was ...

Mayor Holman: I'm looking to City ...

Mr. Hirsch: ... denied the right to speak while the public hearing was going
on.

Mayor Holman: Does the public have an opportunity for point of order? I
don't think so. I don't want to be argumentative, but I think you've had
your time to speak.

Mr. Hirsch: I'm speaking on a different topic ...

Mayor Holman: Which is true.

Mr. Hirsch: ... for the City Attorney to indicate whether ...

Mayor Holman: Joe?

Mr. Hirsch: ... a person can be precluded from speaking while a public
hearing is going on.

Mayor Holman: It is often done, just as a quick response to that. It is often
done. I don't often do it, but it has been done numerous times in the past,
where there is a time by which people need to submit their cards to speak.
