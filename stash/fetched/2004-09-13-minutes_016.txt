Council Member Kleinberg said the Councilâ€™s priorities did not support the
proposal.

Council Member Morton said the vote was for allowing staff to review the
offer of $250,000 of private funds to upgrade the Lytton Plaza.

MOTION PASSED 6-3, Cordell, Freeman, Kleinberg no.

13A. (Old Item No. 10) Three-Year Agreement Between the City of Palo Alto
and the United States Geological Survey in the Amount of $186,000 for San
Francisco Bay Monitoring

Council Member Freeman said she requested the item be removed because it
was a sole source contract, which should have been put out to bid.

Council Member Morton said staff indicated the City had benefited from the
intellectual effort of a world-renowned affiliate. There had been a long-term
relationship between the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and the
City.

Council Member Mossar said in a competitive bidding process, USGS would
win as the City was paying an incremental cost.

MOTION: Council Member Morton moved, seconded by Mossar, to authorize
the Mayor to execute the agreement with the USGS in the amount of
$186,000 to monitor pollutants in clam tissue and sediments and to monitor
ecosystem diversity in the Palo Alto Baylands area of San Francisco Bay
during calendar years 2004-2006.

Mayor Beecham asked whether it was legally permitted.

City Attorney Gary Baum said there were no legal limitations to the award to
the USGS.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION: Council Member Freeman moved to offer the
agreement out to bid and obtain the best solution for the contract.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION FAILED DUE TO LACK OF A SECOND

Council Member Kishimoto asked whether the work was lab work, and how
to determine whether the subcontracting was lab work directed by the City
or were they Research and Development partners.
