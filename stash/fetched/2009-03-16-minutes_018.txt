Council Member Yeh inquired if a large chain grocery store needed more
leeway to change their plastic bag usage procedure than a smaller family
owned specialty store.

Mr. Bobel stated evidence showed how the store perceived themselves was
more the case. For example, Whole Foods is a large grocery chain and they
took the initiative to ban plastic bag use at their check-out counters.

Council Member Yeh inquired on the distinction between convenient stores
and grocery stores. He inquired if it was the quantity of bags used or the
quantity of products sold.

Mr. Bobel stated the City was using the definition the State used to define
convenient stores. He stated smaller stores, such as food vendors, are
difficult to classify.

Vice Mayor Morton stated one of the advantages of moving forward with this
Ordinance was changing the culture of the customer.

Council Member Burt inquired if other cities have adopted fees for bag use
and whether there has been any case law or legal jeopardy involved.

Ms. Bartell stated no other city has placed a fee on the use of paper bags in
California. She stated imposing a plastic bag fee on a store or customer has
not been litigated.

Council Member Burt inquired if the City was prohibited from charging fees
for all bags.

Ms. Bartell stated that was not correct.

Council Member Burt asked if the City had a modest fee on plastic and paper
bags would the City be in jeopardy.

Ms. Bartell stated a fee could be imposed on paper bags but not on plastic
bags.

Mr. Bobel indicated State law stated a fee on plastic bags could not be
imposed in large grocers and pharmacies.

Mayor Drekmeier stated State law also requires           large   grocers   and
pharmacies to accept plastic bags for recycling.

Mr. Bobel stated that was correct.
