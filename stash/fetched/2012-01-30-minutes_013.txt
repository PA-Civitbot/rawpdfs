Council Member Schmid read Bartel and Associates had recommended
selecting the rate of 55 percent confidence limit under Option 1.

Mr. Bartel clarified the confidence level was noted for each option but no
single option was recommended.

Council Member Schmid asked how an Actuary could assist the City to
understand when there was a structural change rather than a general cycle.

Mr. Bartel said the Investment Advisors were saying currently if you were to
invest more aggressively, the volatility of the contribution and assets would
be greater. He explained the volatility mattered when there was a large
amount of assets relative to the payroll. It mattered less in the short run,
particularly when the assets were smaller relative to the payroll.

Council Member Schmid said the discussion at hand was on past obligations
the City needed to pay off.

Mr. Bartel answered yes.

Council Member Schmid questioned the information saying the City was
paying two times the amount for previous employees and the number was
growing.

Mr. Bartel acknowledged the growth and noted the expectation was the
growth pattern would not be to the scope of the recent past.

Council Member Schmid said it was important to be open with the
community to provide them with what the Cityâ€™s obligations were so there
was an understanding of when items needed to be given up.

Mr. Bartel agreed and said for that reason the percentage of the confidence
level was recommended for the discount rate.

Council Member Schmid asked for confirmation the firm was recommending
the 55 or 60 percent confidence level but were not recommending Option 1,
2, or 3.

Mr. Bartel said that was correct.

Council Member Schmid said the report indicated many people switched
medical plans to PERSCare at the age of 65. He asked if that was where the
$7.7 million came from.
