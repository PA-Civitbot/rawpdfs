                         TRANSCRIPT
Council Member Kniss: We wouldn't be meeting on (crosstalk).

Council Member Holman: Yours aren't in Palo Alto schools.

Vice Mayor Scharff:   Yeah, but they have a similar set of things. Tom does.
Eric does.

Mayor Burt: Wait a minute. Just a sec. We don't have to—just a second. Just
a second.

Council Member Holman: The amendment is June 27 to August 5.

Mayor Burt: Just a second. We don't necessarily have to go the full week
before say the 4th of July to let the 4th of July weekend—what day of the week
is the 4th of July?

Council Member Berman: Monday.

Beth Minor, City Clerk: It's Monday.

Mayor Burt: Inclusive one way or another is that Saturday and Sunday. That
would be—if we said we were on vacation from the 2nd onward until whatever
day in August, it's the same thing if you want to take the 4th of July weekend
off.

Council Member Holman: All right. Looking at the calendar, that is true.

AMENDMENT: Council Member Holman moved, seconded by Council Member
XX to replace in the Motion, “July 5 to August 12” with “June 27 to August 5.”

AMENDMENT FAILED DUE TO THE LACK OF A SECOND

Mayor Burt: Trying to wrap this up. Do we continue it, though, all the way to
the 12th to align with the schools or what?

Vice Mayor Scharff: I think we do.

Mayor Burt: Let's call it from July 2nd through the 12th. Is that what we're
doing?

Vice Mayor Scharff: Sure, that's fine.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to replace in the Motion, “July 5” with “July 2.”
