SUBSTITUTE MOTION WITHDRAWN BY SECONDER

Council Member Kleinberg said the City was in bad economic straits, and she
did not know what the next twelve months would bring or what the
community wanted to tell the Council. The Council needed to reevaluate the
decision made in the prior 18-24 months about Mitchell Park.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION DIED FOR LACK OF A SECOND

Mayor Mossar clarified the City would match private donations up to
$800,000.

Ms. Harrison said that was the original motion from the Council.

Mayor Mossar asked why the amount at one point was $800,000 and then
jumped to $2.2 million.

Ms. Harrison said the staff recommendation was limited to the Children’s
Library, and staff had not envisioned going beyond Children’s as a
public/private partnership. The public part of the public/private partnership
was limited to the amount of public funding allocated to the Children’s
Library.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION: Mayor Mossar moved, seconded by Kleinberg, to
direct staff to size a public/private partnership for a maximum City match of
$800,000 for the Children’s Library.

Council Member Morton asked his colleagues to vote against the substitute
motion because it was confusing. He added bullet 7 to the main motion,
which said the project went through the normal CIP budget process. Council
Member Ojakian had said if the community raised half the cost, the Council
would provide the match.

Ms. Harrison said staff would recommend not going with the BAO if it were
to pursue the public/private partnership.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION FAILED 3-5, Burch, Kleinberg, Mossar "yes,”
Beecham absent.

MOTION PASSED 6-2, Kleinberg, Mossar "no," Beecham absent.
