Ms. Gitelman indicated Staff was requesting the Council concur with Staff
placing the item on the Agenda for Council consideration.

Council Member Holman inquired whether the rezoning and Comprehensive
Plan amendment or the preliminary review of the project would be placed on
the Agenda.

Ms. Gitelman reported in the context of the rezoning and Comprehensive
Plan amendment, the Council could discuss the project proposed under both
of those amendments. The prescreening request was related to rezoning
and the Comprehensive Plan amendment.

Council Member Holman asked if the project would be presented as
conceptual at the time of the prescreening.

Ms. Gitelman believed the section of the Zoning Ordinance related to
prescreening provided for conceptual review if an application had not been
filed, and a more detailed review if an application had been filed. She would
need to review that if the Council approved Staff placing it on a future
Agenda.
