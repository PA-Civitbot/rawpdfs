I know several of my colleagues are interested in the idea of a fully undergrounded

scenario, and the alternatives analysis will allow us to better understand the physical

constraints and costs associated with this idea, as well as the pros and cons of other

solutions like the trenching option we’ve studied in the past. Most importantly, we will

have the information with which to decide as a community what we want and are able to

do.




Infrastructure is another priority and we are investing significantly to rebuild it. I would

like us to accelerate the timing to complete these projects. I believe we can finish the

Bike Bridge over Highway 101 next year. The community needs that Bike Bridge and it

should be a priority project. Without the vision of Vice Mayor Liz Kniss and her work to

secure County funding for this project, we would not be as close to making this bridge a

reality.

           Let’s give a big hand to Vice Mayor Kniss who unfortunately couldn’t join us

           today due to a family emergency.




I also wanted to talk about two extraordinary public private partnerships that will add so

much to our community. The first is the renovation of 450 Bryant Street, where our

valued partner Avenidas resides. Last year, Avenidas served over 7,500 seniors and

hosted 233 classes in only 5,600 square feet of program space. Older adults make up

the largest segment of our population; over 1/3rd of area residents are over the age of

55. By 2030, those over 55 are projected to be 50% of the population as Baby Boomers
