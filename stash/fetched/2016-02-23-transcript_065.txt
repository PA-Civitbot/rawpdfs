                        TRANSCRIPT
Council Member Schmid: Council Member Wolbach.       I guess it's not 3:00
any more. We're moving on.

MOTION RESTATED: Council Member Filseth moved, seconded by Council
Member DuBois to:

A.   Adopt a Resolution amending Resolution 9473 to implement Phase 2 of
     the Downtown Residential Preferential Parking (RPP) District Pilot
     Program; and

B.   Direct Staff to make corresponding changes to the Council approved
     RPP Administrative Guidelines; and

C.   Add to Resolution Section 5(C)(2)(g)(1) “no daily or five day
     scratchers will be sold in Zones 9 and 10” after “be sold randomly;”
     and

D.   Move up Council review to four months; and

E.   Add to Resolution Section 6.D., a Number 3, “Reduced rate for Addison
     Elementary School employees - $100/year.”

Council Member Schmid: If there are no other comments, let me call the
question. All in favor of the Resolution.

Council Member Kniss: Do we just want to raise our hand? We're not on
the board are we?

Council Member Schmid:       Yes, just raise our hand.       That passes
unanimously.

MOTION AS AMENDED PASSED:            5-0 Berman, Burt, Holman, Scharff
absent

Council Member Kniss: I might add, if it hadn't passed unanimously, we
would have had a problem.

Council Member Schmid: Right. We passed the Resolution. Do we need to
pass the ordinance?

Council Member DuBois: We need to pass Item One. I move that we pass
Item One, the Ordinance.

Council Member Filseth: Second.

Council Member Wolbach: Second.
