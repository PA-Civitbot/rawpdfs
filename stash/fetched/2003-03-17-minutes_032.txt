Council Member Ojakian asked whether the agreement date of July 19,
2003, was the demolition date for the wings and spine.

Mr. Calonne said it did not explicitly address the spine.

Council Member Ojakian asked about Karen Holman’s presentation of
another individual’s analysis of preserving the spine.

Mr. Roberts said it had been reviewed and discussed with the structural
engineer, who felt it could have saved approximately $50,000 in gross costs;
however, it would have ongoing maintenance issues. It was basically to
replace a concrete wall and dirt fill with a plywood wall and dirt. It would
have a minor cost savings, but would generate operational problems.

Council Member Ojakian asked if it would be of further value to review the
solution.

Mr. Roberts said no.

Council Member Ojakian recalled the possibility of selling the building.

Mayor Mossar said yes. It had been an option.

Mr. Benest said if demolition was approved, staff requested that Council
direct staff to return with a Budget Amendment Ordinance (BAO) for the
additional cost not in the Infrastructure Reserve.

Council Member Ojakian raised concerns that the City would be faced with
future added costs in maintaining the spine and, therefore, he did not
support the motion.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER for staff to return with a Budget Amendment
Ordinance (BAO).

Mayor Mossar said she concurred with Council Member Ojakian. She felt
that funds currently required to maintain, protect, and preserve historic
structures would not be regained in the future and it was not realistically
affordable to keep the spine.

Council Member Burch was in support of the motion because he felt the
property would be of more value with the spine.
