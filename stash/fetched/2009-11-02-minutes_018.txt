Ms. Le Clair stated that was correct; however, City Staff had now requested
a specific report for Palo Alto numbers.

Council Member Klein asked how the hotel room booked nights were
calculated to reflect economic impact.

Ms. Le Clair stated they were using a standard rate of $292 per night.

Council Member Klein asked why the brochure printed listed very little Palo
Alto events.

Ms. Le Clair stated the Bureau sales team had a list to contact on a monthly
basis regarding upcoming events. She noted there was an electronic link
added to Palo Alto to check the Cityâ€™s on-line calendar of events which was
updated regularly.

Council Member Klein asked how the Council could verify the program had
returns on the investment.

Ms. Barnes stated the challenge was the leads were between eighteen to
twenty-four months before an actual booking.

Council Member Klein asked why the report read the hotels were not being
cooperative.

Ms. Le Clair clarified the hotels were being cooperative with the program, the
report was referring to the survey portion of the program. Over the past
year there had been very little cooperation through the hotels with having
clientele complete the surveys.

Council Member Klein asked what City Staff was doing to increase the
outcome of the situation.

Ms. Le Clair stated the surveys were filled out by the hotel clientele and were
requested by the staff at the hotel. She noted the surveys were going out
but were either not being returned or were being returned slowly.

Ms. Barnes stated the larger numbers seen in the quarterly report from
Destination Palo Alto were aggregate numbers from the Bureau. The 11,600
was a specific number requested by City Staff of the Bureau to break-out
Palo Alto numbers.
