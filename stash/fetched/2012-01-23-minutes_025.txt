Mr. Larkin indicated courts have said there was not a cumulative impact
when there were distinct small projects. He said the proposal was not small
interconnected projects to form one massive project. He explained the case
law on this issue.

Council Member Holman inquired if the City undergrounded utilities would
AT&T be required to relocate their equipment at its expense.

Mr. Larkin stated that was a provision in the Master Lease Agreement.

Mr. Williams recalled that was a specific question that evening.

Council Member Holman asked if Staff was confident the requirement to
remove damaged or abandoned equipment was also in the Master Lease.

Mr. Larkin indicated it was in the Ordinance and the Master License
Agreement.

Council Member Holman asked whether Staff could provide an assurance
that there would be Code enforcement and penalty assessment regarding
noise issues.

Mr. Williams said Staff would review it as a Code enforcement issue, and
thought there had been success with enforcing noise issues. He indicated
this was more clear cut than other cases since there were Conditions of
Approval regarding compliance. He felt the City had a technique with the
battery box of instructing AT&T to turn it off until it could be made to comply
with the ordinance.

Council Member Holman referenced Packet Page 430 regarding IDEO's
concepts not being reviewed, and asked when were the concepts prepared
and had there been adequate time to make those determinations. She was
interested in obtaining better designs for the equipment going forward.

Ms. French thought AT&T considered the IDEO concepts and determined the
concepts would require time.

Council Member Holman asked what was a long time and how long had it
been since the concepts were presented.

Ms. French indicated the ARB discussion was held on December 8, 2011.
