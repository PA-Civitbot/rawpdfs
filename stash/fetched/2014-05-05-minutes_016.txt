MOTION: Council Member Klein moved, seconded by Council Member
Holman to schedule a special City Council meeting the first available
Saturday in June for discussion of the Comprehensive Plan regarding policy
direction.

Council Member Klein suggested a meeting in June to allow time for Staff to
revise the draft document or respond as appropriate. At a Special Meeting,
the Council could take action, if appropriate, with regard to the draft
Comprehensive Plan.

Council Member Holman suggested the Motion include the intention to
discuss policy direction.

Council Member Klein clarified that the agenda for a Special Meeting would
be limited to discussion of the Comprehensive Plan.

Ms. Gitelman reported initiating the public engagement process while
scheduling an opportunity for additional Council direction could send mixed
messages to the public.      Staff would have difficulty designing public
outreach, engaging with the public, and supporting another detailed Council
meeting simultaneously. Another Council meeting could elongate the entire
Comprehensive Plan update process.

Mr. Keene requested clarification as to whether Staff should delay the
process for a month.

Mayor Shepherd asked if the Motion implied a delay in the process.

Mr. Keene indicated some clarity would be helpful.      Scheduling another
meeting would create a tradeoff.

Council Member Klein would support delaying public outreach for a month.

Council Member Holman did not expect Staff to revise the draft document.
She inquired whether Staff could schedule a Special Meeting for a Saturday
in May.

Mr. Keene advised that the date would depend on work required of Staff.

Council Member Holman did not believe Staff would need to perform
additional work. The meeting would allow Council Members to conclude their
comments.
