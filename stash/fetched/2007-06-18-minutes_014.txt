Council Member Morton asked once the Ordinance was revised would this be
considered the second reading and then go forward to P&TC and ARB.

Mr. Emslie stated he was correct.

Council Member Mossar stated she was voting against the motion and there
needed to be room for improvement and changes.

Council Member Beecham stated he supported the motion.

Vice Mayor Klein stated there should be language provided for the ground
floor of the buildings. He asked to include on page three, paragraph three,
“The following uses shall be permitted on the ground floor of the three
neighborhood commercial buildings.”

Council Member Kleinberg stated they did not need to have pedestrian
access on the second floor.

Council Member Cordell questioned the eating and drinking services, retail
services, banks and finance on the ground floor.

Vice Mayor Klein stated the idea had been stated that ground floor would be
retail.

Mr. Emslie asked for clarification that the Motion would read that the uses on
the ground floor should include eating and drinking, and retail services. The
remaining uses, as modified, would include: banks, financial services,
neighborhood business services, medical offices and commercial and
recreation would be on the second floor.

Council Member Beecham asked to restrict the ground floor to retail
services, eating and drinking.

Mayor Kishimoto asked whether he wanted it proposed as an amendment.

Council Member Kleinberg stated she did not accept that change of 4(a)(3),
which would be constricting the developer.

Vice Mayor Klein stated this was where the Motion started.

Council Member Kleinberg stated she did not make the change to the
Motion. She stated she did not want to differentiate for ground floor or
second floor.
