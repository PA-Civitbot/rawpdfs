Council Member Mossar stated concern for putting Ciardella’s out of business
for a number of months.

Mr. Emslie stated the core issue is the operation of the site and the land use
decisions have been blended due to the Applicant occupying the site prior to
the architecture review being in place.

The Public Hearing opened at 7:28 p.m.

Sheri Furman, 3094 Greer Rd., supported staff recommendation and
recommended to expedite their application.

Nicholas Jellins, 841 Menlo Ave, Menlo Park, supported the staff
recommendation to adopt: the mitigated negative declaration, the resolution
on the Comprehensive Plan designation and rezoning the site.

Chris Griffith, 601 California Avenue, San Francisco, agreed with staff
recommendation, and stated the environmental impact needed to be
completed.

Bob Moss, 4010 Orme, spoke regarding Ciardella’s receiving special
treatment.

Rick Ciardella, 957 Rose Ave, Menlo Park, stated Ciardella’s had been
cooperative with the neighboring businesses involving the move.

Public Hearing closed at 7:50 p.m.

City Attorney Gary Baum recommended Council not proceed at this time, as
passing the zone change with an inadequate environmental impact review
could cause legal action against further work on the site.

Mr. Emslie stated six weeks would be an aggressive estimate for return,
upon the applicant’s expedient return of items required.


Council Member Morton asked why it took five months to return a response
on the project and if this is the timeframe Council would be looking at for the
item to return.

Mr. Emslie stated the more complete the Applicant was the more expedient
the process.

Council Member Morton asked what the Architectural Review Boards (ARB)
decision was.
