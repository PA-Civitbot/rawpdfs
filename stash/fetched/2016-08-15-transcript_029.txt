Mayor Burt: Council Member Berman.

Council Member Berman: Thank you. Do we have anything in the Code that
deals with the treatment of windows at the ground-floor level on buildings
like the proposal today?

Mr. Ah Sing: No, but there is within a pedestrian overlay combining district.
I think the idea is to not have it opaque. You want to keep it so people can
see in.

Council Member Berman: Is that something that we can write into the
conditions of approval for the project?

Mr. Ah Sing: Yes.

Council Member Berman: Thanks.

Mayor Burt: Can you review both the adjacent and nearby zoning? Across
on Kipling we have RM-30. What about the surrounding areas? Maybe it's
in the report, and I just wasn't picking up on it. If it is in the report, can you
also point me to where?

Mr. Lait: Sure. Sheldon might be able to help us with that. From memory,
looking at the map, RMD is to the north of the project site.

Mayor Burt: RMD?

Mr. Lait: RMD.

Mayor Burt: Remind me what's permissible there.

Mr. Lait: It's a couple of units. I think it's like duplex type of housing, but
I'll double check that.

Mayor Burt: That's basically behind it.

Mr. Lait: Correct.

Mayor Burt: One of the ARB findings is about harmonious transitions and
scale and character—that's Finding Number 5—in areas between different
designated land uses. Can Staff explain how they viewed the compatibility
or harmonious transition between this and the units on the RMD behind it?

Mr. Lait: I'll start, and then Sheldon may want to chime in. This would be
reflected in the—I think it's Attachment D in the Packet, dealing with the
records of the Director's decision. My recollection is that part of the way
