announcements in a manner consistent with Government Code. He stated
that the Council would be making general comments.

Council Member Burt stated Mayor Kleinâ€™s clarification helped address his
concerns and clarified that Council Members can ask questions of Staff but
cannot discuss the item or make comments regarding personnel matters.

Mr. Baum stated the primary issue is not violating the Brown Act and the
secondary issue is the Council cannot act outside of its legal role of policy
setting.

Council Member Burt asked for confirmation that the Council can ask
questions of Staff provided they are not prejudicial to potential personnel
actions.

Mr. Baum stated the Council can direct questions to Staff.

Council Member Burt asked for confirmation that the Council can make
comments provided there is no discussion among the Council Members.

Mr. Baum stated his confirmation of that statement with the caution that the
comments should be made in the context of future direction of action to be
brought back to Council.

Council Member Burt asked specifically if the Council Members were
permitted to make comments that do not constitute discussion among
Council Members on an item that was not agendized.

Mr. Baum stated the Council Members were permitted to make comments as
long as there was no discussion of an item that has not been listed on the
agenda.

Council Member Espinosa stated he will be opposing the Motion. He stated
that this is a very sensitive topic and that this was not the way to approach
the discussion. He stated his preference for agendizing the item as a Public
Hearing.
