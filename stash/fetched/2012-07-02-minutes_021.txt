Mayor Yeh asked Staff to respond to Council Member Schmid, and then the
discussion would continue.

Mr. Bobel indicated Staff would look at gasification as a technology for
treating organic material.

Council Member Klein stated Agenda Item Nos. 7 and 8 were clear. It was
not appropriate for Council Members to discuss other systems, except to use
that as a reason for voting no on the current Items. Voters directed the
Council to determine whether this was technologically and financially
feasible.

Mayor Yeh asked whether regional partners would assume cost sharing with
respect to biosolids as part of shared management of the Regional Water
Quality Control Plant.

Mr. Bobel answered yes for biosolids.

Mayor Yeh felt Staff should plant the idea of cost sharing with regional
partners. He asked Staff to list the cities they contacted.

Mr. Bobel could not list all of the cities contacted for food and yard waste,
because Staff did not have a definitive list.

Mayor Yeh reported elected officials had expressed interest to him. The
Council should move forward on this initial analysis. If partners in cost
sharing were brought in early in the process, then that would signal a
willingness to continue. He inquired about the length of a long-term
contract.

Mr. Bobel stated typically the solid waste contracts were in the ten-year
timeframe.

Mayor Yeh meant where the contracts were in the cycle.

Mr. Bobel said Staff would obtain and provide that information.

Mayor Yeh asked Staff to describe the financing structure and identify costs
borne by private and public entities in private financing options.

Mr. Binder indicated typically communities would consider private financing
of new technologies when they did not want to assume a debt risk. A
private party had many different methods for financing a project.
