statutory intent to regulate SSIs under § 112 and not § 129, EPA should abandon this rulemaking and return to
its previous plan to regulate SSIs under § 112 of the CAA, likely as area sources. The technical corrections
discussed in the comments below are warranted under any future rulemaking effort. NACWA encourages EPA
to take the time now to develop a more thorough and accurate understanding of SSIs.

II.      EPA’S REGULATORY FLEXIBILITY ACT ANALYSIS IS FLAWED AND THE IMPACT ON SMALL
         ENTITIES MUST BE REVISITED.
         A.       EPA’s Small Entity Analysis Assumes All Units Will Abandon Incineration

         EPA is required under the RFA to prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis of this rule unless the agency
certifies that the proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. See 75 Fed. Reg. at 63292. EPA concluded that none of the 18 small entities14 identified in the database
have cost-revenue ratios greater than one percent because they would all find it cost effective to divert sewage
sludge to landfills. Based on this conclusion, the Administrator certified that the Proposed Rule resulted in no
significant impact for a significant number of small entities (“No SISNOSE”). In the Regulatory Impacts
Analysis (“RIA”), EPA nonetheless identified the following small entity impacts if they were required to install
one of the three control technology options under consideration for the final MACT standard:

         o    Option 1 (MACT floor)
                  9 of 18 small entities affected at greater than 1 percent cost-revenue ratio
                  2 of 18 affected at greater than 3 percent cost-revenue ratio

         o    Option 2 (MACT floor + afterburner for MH)
                  13 of 18 small entities affected at greater than 1 percent
                  2 of 18 affected at greater than 3 percent

         o    Option 3 (Option 2 + fabric filter for MH)
                  16 of 18 small entities affected at greater than 1 percent
                  3 of 18 affected at greater than 3 percent

See RIA Tables 4-5, 4-6, and 4-7. EPA’s Option 3 with its beyond the floor mercury controls will significantly
affect 16 of 18 small entities at greater than 1 percent of their cost-revenue ratios and three of those at greater
than 3 percent. These levels of impact would require a more thorough consideration of small entity impacts
based on EPA’s Final Guidance for EPA Rulewriters: Regulatory Flexibility Act as Amended by the Small Business and
Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (November 2006) (disallowing a presumption of No SISNOSE at these levels
of impact). Only by assuming the cost-effective landfill alternative for small entities could the Administrator
presume No SISNOSE under this guidance and shortcut the administrative protections that the RFA and Small

14
   NACWA invites EPA to reassess the number of small entities operating SSIs when it confirms the number of active SSIs. Regional
sewer districts may serve across municipal boundaries making the traditional 50,000 population criterion for small entities difficult to
apply. In the absence of an ICR survey, we understand that the small entity determinations were made based on internet searches of
population data for the closest related municipal entity. This is not a reliable methodology. For the purpose of this discussion, we rely
on EPA’s numbers.
