AND SECONDER to include in-kind contributions as described by the
Fair Political Practices Commission (FPPC) with a contribution limit of
$350.00.

Council Member Mossar said she was a Council Member and a candidate
when there were voluntary spending limits and campaign contributions.
She vaguely recalled the California voters passing an initiative that was
challenged in Court making the ordinance illegal. She felt the limit
issues on both sides should be thoroughly vetted prior to moving
forward.

Council Member Cordell clarified the cap portion needed immediate
attention but not the spending portion.

Council Member Beecham said it was through a self-loan in the case of
the candidate, who received thousands of dollars and did not think it
was prohibited.

Mr. Baum said under Buckley v. Vallejo the individualâ€™s expenditures
could not be limited on campaigns.

Council Member Kleinberg supported the $350.00 cap with the cost of
living index annual adjustment.

Council Member Barton asked whether the Motion was encapsulated in
the first sentence of the Colleagues Memo and if it referred to any
election.

Council Member Cordell clarified it was for City Council Elections.

Council Member Motion did not support the motion.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION: Vice Mayor Klein moved, seconded by
Beecham, to refer these issues to the Policy and Services Committee.

Council Member Kleinberg referred to the in-kind contribution and said
she had experienced a situation during a campaign where a letter was
sent in support of her candidacy. She had rejected the letter because
of its unpleasantness. The mailing cost of the letter exceeded $350.00.
She was not able to control this and would have been in violation.

Ms. Rogers said it was an independent expenditure claimed by the
individual.
