Chief Johnson asked whether the policy would state the officer must use a
Taser first before the use of deadly force.

Council Member Cordell stated the Taser may be used where lethal force

Mayor Kishimoto stated she thought the policy would be while an officer
provides coverage a Taser could be used.

where a gun would be permitted to be drawn. She stated there is not
enough information about Tasers and trying to balance officers’ safety and
what is going on in the streets. When there is more information on Tasers,
this policy could change.

Vice Mayor Klein asked whether the policy should still state “in a situation
where a gun would be drawn.”

Council Member Cordell stated no it should state “when lethal force would be
permitted.” When an officer pulls a gun it is considered lethal force and if a
