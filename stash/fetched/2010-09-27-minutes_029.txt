Council Member Klein said the Substitute Motion could be worse than the
original Motion. He asked the City Manager how much was in the Council
Contingency Fund.

Mr. Keene said over $150,000.

Council Member Klein said the Substitute Motion may be more trouble than
what it was worth. The current process was easier.        Having to edit
information for on-line input may be added work. He had concerns that the
shorter titles published could have legal issues.

Mayor Burt felt placing a notice at the top of the agenda and directing the
public to the website would be sufficient.

Ms. Grider raised concerns about having insufficient funds to carry the
advertisement through the mid-year budget process.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER that these funds come from Council Contingency
Funds to be replenished at the mid-year budget.

Council Member Scharff needed clarification from the City Attorney regarding
Council Member Klein’s legal concerns regarding publication.

Mr. Baum said Council Member Klein’s concern was more of practical or
political issue than legal. The City Attorney’s Office defense would be that
the on-line version of the agenda was not required.
