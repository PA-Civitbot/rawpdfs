City Manager Frank Benest stated the Council had previously authorized staff
to incorporate the design costs into the bond election.

Mayor Klein stated his concern was the design costs had not been included
throughout the process and therefore to include them at the end would take
funding away from the project.

Council Member Burt stated incorporating the LEED Gold standard was
fiscally prudent.

Council Member Kishimoto asked whether the increase in the utility cost was
due to the increase in square footage.

Ms. Morariu stated yes, as the design and LEED Gold elements were refined,
the cost estimates may change, however at present staff had presented the
most accurate estimate.

Council Member Kishimoto asked whether the estimated five full-time
employees (FTE) mentioned in the report was larger than the original
estimate.

Director of Libraries Diane Jennings stated the number of FTEâ€™s required
depended on which conceptual model was adopted. The consultant
recommended three FTE for the two-story library, one for the community
center and one facility mechanic.
