Planning & Community Environment Steve Emslie had a conflict of
interest. He served on the InVision Board of Directors, a public service
grant applicant, and could not participate in the CDBG Program. The
Federal Housing and Urban Development (HUD) notified the City of its
good standing and would receive full grant allocations the following year
if the Federal government did not modify the program.

Eloiza Murillo-Garcia, Community Development Block Grant Coordinator,
gave an overview of the CDBG Program outlined in staff report
(CMR:231:05).

Steve Mullen, CDBG Citizens Advisory Committee spokesperson,
reported on the Committee’s deliberations. Focus was on the needs of
families with children, the homeless, and seniors. The decision process
was difficult due to funding constraints. Funds had declined in the past
few years and the requested allocations exceeded the available funds.
Service funding requests were $200,000 and $127,000 was allocated.
Capital funding requests were $1.1 million and $623,000 was allocated.
There were concerns of prior year’s funded projects not going through.
They had been tied in with staff’s proposal of potential housing sites that
might be available for acquisition and monitored through September
2006. The Committee would be informed at that time of its status with
the possibility of introducing another request during the second year of
the funding cycle.

Mayor Burch declared the Public Hearing open at 7:53 p.m.

Susan Thomas, Director of Stevenson House, expressed her appreciation
for the Citizens Advisory Committee and the Finance Committee’s
recommendation and support.

Mayor Burch declared the Public Hearing closed at 7:55 p.m.

            2005/06 Action Plan update to the Consolidated Plan for the

            2005/06 Action Plan to the Department of Housing and
            Urban Development (HUD) by the May 15, 2005 deadline.
