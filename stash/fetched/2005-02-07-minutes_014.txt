AMENDMENT: Council Member Morton moved to include that Council
explore the benefit to the City of increasing the maximum allowed parking
exemption for bonus floor area, under certain conditions, from 5,000 square
feet to 10,000 square feet with the understanding that the process will
include the requirement to be recommended by Council and a neighborhood
impact report.

Council Member Beecham asked what the cost and timeframe would be if
the amendment was included.

Mr. Emslie said the cost would be $40,000 for a parking analysis and the
additional work was included in staff’s work program, which would be
completed in the next 12 months.
