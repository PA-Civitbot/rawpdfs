Director of Parks and Golf Paul Dias said yes, to the best extent possible.
Staff had plans to work with the Palo Alto Unified School District (PAUSD)
since both sites had the most outdated courts in the school system.

Council Member Freeman asked for an explanation of "maintaining the
courts."

Mr. Dias said maintaining meant washing, blowing and cleaning. It did not
include resurfacing.

Council Member Freeman referred to Item No. 8 and asked how staff
determined that California Land Management (CLM), which patrolled, picked
up trash, and kept order in the parks, was the only local organization that
could provide the range of needed services for Palo Alto for the past 21
years.

Director of Community Services Richard James said CLM was an organization
that supplied many services, such as security, janitorial services, and
recreational consultants. CLM supplied all those services at a rate that was
far below what could be achieved with multiple companies.

Council Member Freeman asked whether a bid process was conducted to
make that determination.

Superintendent of Open Space and Sciences Greg Betts said through
contacts with the California Parks and Recreation Society and the California
Park Ranger Association, staff looked at a number of different vendors and
found CLM to be the only vendor in Northern California.

Council Member Freeman asked whether there was a bid.

Mr. James said CLM was a sole source and, therefore, a bid was not
required.

Council Member Freeman registered a no vote on Item No. 8.

Council Member Freeman moved to remove Item No. 7. There was no
second and, therefore, the item was not removed.

Council Member Mossar registered a no vote on Item No. 6.

Council Member Kleinberg registered a no vote on Item No. 6.

MOTION: Council Member Ojakian moved, seconded by Burch, to approve
