V.   Standing Committees

     A. Policy. It is the policy of the Council to use standing committees in open and
     public meetings to study City business in greater depth than what is possible in the
     time allotted for Council meetings.

            1. Purpose. These rules are intended to enhance public participation and
            committee meetings so that the best possible decisions can be made for Palo
            Alto.

      B. General Requirements. Council standing committees shall be subject to the
      following procedural rules.




                                                                                                          Attachment: 2.15.11 (1422 : Policy and Services Agenda 2/15/2011)
            1. Quorum. A majority of the committee membership shall constitute a
            quorum.

            2. Referrals. Only the Council or City Manager shall make referrals to the
            standing committees. Referrals will generally be directed to only one of the
            standing committees. Items may be withdrawn from the committee and
            taken up for consideration by the Council at any Council meeting with the
            consent of a majority of the Council, and subject to any applicable noticing
            or agenda posting requirements. Council members who submit matters to
            the Council which are referred to a standing committee may appear before
            the standing committee to which the referral has been made in order to speak
            as proponents of the matter. Standing committee meetings during which
            such referrals may be considered shall be noticed as Council meetings for the
            purpose of enabling the standing committee to discuss and consider the
            matter with a quorum of the Council present.

            3. Function of committees. The purpose and intent of committee meetings
            is to provide for more thorough and detailed discussion and study of
            prospective or current Council agenda items with a full and complete airing
            of all sentiments and expressions of opinion on city problems by both the
            Council and the public, to the end that Council action will be expedited.
            Actions of the committee shall be advisory recommendations only.

            4. Minutes. The City Clerk shall be responsible for the preparation and
            distribution to the Council of the minutes of standing committee meetings.
            The minutes for these meetings shall be sense minutes which reflect the
            motions made during these meetings. The minutes shall be delivered to all
            Council Members before the Council meeting at which the committee's
            recommendations are to be discussed.
