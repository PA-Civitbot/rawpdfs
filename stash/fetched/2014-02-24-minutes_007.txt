Mr. Rodriguez indicated Staff had to consider not the individual categories
but the sum of the project. Redgwick's bid was lower than other bids.
Typically during construction, contractors would request funds be transferred
from one category to another, such that categories balanced as construction
progressed. That would likely happen in this project.

Council Member Klein felt the contingency amount was less appropriate in
this instance than in other contracts.

Mayor Shepherd noted page 5 contained the waterline improvements of $1.3
million. The water main repair was a new item for the project. She
requested Staff comment on the need to add waterline replacement to the
project.

Mr. Rodriguez explained the City began experiencing failures in the existing
waterline over the prior year.         The Utilities Department requested
replacement be included in the project to prevent construction in the same
area at a later time. Staff requested the contractor perform waterline
replacement as the first item of work.

Council Member Holman inquired whether the project had been value
engineered prior to construction.

Mr. Rodriguez responded yes. An independent consultant from the original
designer reviewed design, specifications, and opportunities to save money.
The waterline was added to the project in order to avoid an overall delay in
the project.

Council Member Price asked if Staff modified the estimate process in
recognition of a changing bid environment.

Mr. Rodriguez reported as projects were bid, Staff reviewed specific unit
items for all bid elements and updated their own Engineer's estimate
categories.  Also Staff worked with construction management firms to
compare project estimates with projects in other cities within the Bay Area.
