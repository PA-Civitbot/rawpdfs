Mayor Holman: At the moment we need to—are you talking about in the
amendment that Council Member Wolbach has offered?

Council Member Filseth: No, I'm talking about the Main Motion.

Mayor Holman: You need to speak to the amendment at this moment.

Council Member Filseth: I'll accept the amendment.

Mayor Holman: Vice Mayor Schmid?

Vice Mayor Schmid: Yes.

Mayor Holman: Your amendment is accepted. Council Member Wolbach,
you still have the floor. We'll come back to you, Council Member Filseth.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to add to the Motion, “direct CAC and Staff to
consider Policies and Programs to promote business development and
employer partnerships to significantly mitigate impacts of job growth
including but not limited to parking, housing, and traffic.”

Council Member Wolbach:     Since I have the floor, I'll let the conversation
move on.

Mayor Holman: Council Member Filseth.

Council Member Filseth: I want to suggest we change the word "moderate"
to "manage."

Mayor Holman: Where are you, sir?

Council Member Filseth: That's it.

Mayor Holman: Vice Mayor Schmid?

Vice Mayor Schmid: I like "moderate," since we have one of the highest
rates in the country of jobs to employed residences.

Council Member Filseth: I hear you. If there's a recession in two years and
we've got 30 percent unemployment in this town.

Mayor Holman: I will second your amendment if Vice Mayor is not accepting
it. I'll second your amendment then.

AMENDMENT: Council Member Filseth moved, seconded by Mayor Holman
to replace in the Motion, “moderate” with “manage.”
