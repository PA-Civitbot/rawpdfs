Council Member Mossar said the memo seemed to duplicate what was
already ongoing.

Ms. Harrison said staff believed the initiatives were consistent with the
direction previously given, but it was a new part of the work plan.

Council Member Mossar questioned if it was something staff was already
engaged in why it merited a separate memorandum. She also inquired about
the Mayor’s GRTF.

Mayor Kleinberg said she would share information regarding the GRTF once
it was formatted.

Council Member Drekmeier said reuse was the most efficient form of
recycling. He appreciated the way the initiative evolved the construction and
demolition ordinance to focus more on dismantling and reuse of materials.

Council Member Barton noted the amount of paper it took in distributing the
Council’s packet. He suggested going to a paperless packet within the
following year.

MOTION PASSED 9-0.

5.    Colleagues Memo from Mayor Kleinberg, Vice Mayor Kishimoto and
      Council Member Klein regarding Santa Clara County Land Conservation
      Initiative

      Resolution 8596 entitled “Resolution of the Council of the City of Palo
      Alto Expressing Support for the Santa Clara County Land Conservation
      Initiative”

Council Member Drekmeier said he would not participate in this item
because he is employed by People for Land and Nature (PLAN), the sponsor
of the Initiative.

MOTION: Vice Mayor Kishimoto moved, seconded by Klein, for the City
Council to approve a resolution in support of the Santa Clara County Land
Conservation Initiative.

Vice Mayor Kishimoto said the initiative presented long term consequences.
It would affect unincorporated Santa Clara County, but had no affect on land
designated for housing. Supporting the initiative was a first step in
embracing change, progress, and economic prosperity with efficiency
through land use.
