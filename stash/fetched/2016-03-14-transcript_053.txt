Mr. George: The large employers is $10,000; it's included in that line.
There's three members at $10,000. The medium size is $2,500, and the
small is $50.    There's been some miscommunication about the small
employer being $1,000, and that is in fact $50. That's reflective in the
$35,050 line on the ...

Vice Mayor Scharff: The small employer is $50?

Mr. George: $50.

Vice Mayor Scharff: $50?

Mr. George: $50.

Vice Mayor Scharff: How did such small contribution amounts become—I
mean, $50 seems ridiculously small, frankly.

Ms. Silvani: This is just the contributions from the Board Members. We
have yet to develop other contributions and fees for services and other
possible revenue streams. That's what we're going to be focusing on.

Vice Mayor Scharff: What I heard originally was that you didn't want the
Executive Director to have to spend all the time fundraising. I just try to
figure out how these numbers even work. If the $54 is $128, that's an
extra—I'm bad at math quickly. It's like an extra $70,000, so it's $182 plus
$70. That's $250,000. Two what?

Male: $256.

Vice Mayor Scharff: $256, but your projected revenues is $165. Right?
We're short $100,000 just to round up. Where's that $100,000 coming
from?

Hillary Gitelman, Planning and Community Environment Director: Hi, Hillary
Gitelman, the Planning Director. Maybe I can help a little, maybe not that
much. A couple of things. First, the budget that you see in the Staff Report,
as I understand it, was the budget that was in place at the time that the
organization was forming. This is what was submitted as a draft budget for
the organization of the 501(c)(3). It's only natural that that has evolved a
little over time. There is also funding that currently exists in the City's
contract with MIG and Silvani Associates. That funding is part of what's
funding ongoing expenses.

Vice Mayor Scharff: That's above the City pilot program funding (crosstalk)?
