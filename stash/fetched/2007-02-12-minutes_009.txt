Council Member Mossar said the applicant raised concern regarding the tree
ordinance which protected the Heritage Oak and Redwood trees. If the
Council was interested in the argument of Redwood trees being de facto
unsafe because of size, she suggested to agendize a review and discussion
of the tree ordinance. She was not in favor of a hearing. The Planning &
Transportation Commission (P&TC) encouraged the applicant to get a
certified arborist’s opinion. Big trees did have an inherent danger. Big trees
contributed to mitigating the effects of carbon dioxide. It was a difficult and
complex issue.

Vice Mayor Klein supported Council Members Kleinberg and Cordell. He was
in favor of a public hearing due to the hazardous conditions of the trees.

Council Member Cordell said the intent of her motion was not to set a
moratorium on the ordinance but to address meeting the criteria regarding
hazardous conditions posed by the trees.

Council Member Kleinberg echoed Council Member Cordell’s comments.

Mayor Kishimoto said the three required votes were established. She noted
40 applications had been approved in the past year to remove Redwood
trees in Palo Alto.

Consent Calendar Item Nos. 4 through 10.
