Vice Mayor Schmid agreed bird safety was an issue. The arch design was a
distraction from the openness of the Baylands.

Mr. Keene wanted to perform additional research regarding costs before
spending a couple hundred thousand dollars for additional design. The
Moffatt and Nichol design had not been implemented previously. Managing
costs was always a concern for the City.

Council Member Berman agreed with Staff performing due diligence.

Vice Mayor Schmid asked if Council Member Berman wished to include a
timeframe for Staff to return with information.

Mr. Keene advised that Staff could provide that information along with the
contract.

MOTION PASSED: 7-0 Holman, Scharff absent

Council Member Burt reported the design competition provided two
exceptional designs. The Council selected a context appropriate design over
an exceptional architectural design. The process worked well.
