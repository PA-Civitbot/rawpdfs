Council Member Morton said as a tradeoff with the applicant was to consider
trading additional retail use.

Vice Mayor Beecham asked whether the January 30 Plan complied with
residential and retail parking code requirements.

Mr. Emslie said it did comply for both residential and retail parking onsite.

Vice Mayor Beecham asked if the public benefits proposed by the applicant
were adequate.

Mr. Emslie said the P&TC’s recommendation and staff’s recommendation to
the P&TC contained a substantial amount of public parking. Staff was
favorably disposed on providing parking as a public benefit.

Vice Mayor Beecham verified that staff preferred the Current Plan versus
the January 30t Plan.

Mr. Emslie said that was correct; however, the developer said it could not
be built as recommended, which had to be resolved.

Vice Mayor Beecham asked whether the current parking situation in the
area was good or bad.

Mr. Emslie said there was a lot of long-term or unregulated parking that
could be made more efficient by having shorter turnovers. Currently,
parking was tolerable. The spillover parking into the neighborhood could be
addressed by providing on-site parking. He felt as SOFA objectives were
implemented, the demand for parking would increase if off-site parking was
not provided.

Vice Mayor Beecham said that local businesses in the area had asked for
more parking and wanted to know if parking in the area was currently
inadequate for their customers.

Mr. Emslie said yes.

Vice Mayor Beecham asked whether the parcel owner was obligated to
provide parking for other uses that currently do not have sufficient parking.

Mr. Emslie said no.

Vice Mayor Beecham asked how the Council should proceed with the
January 30 Plan.
