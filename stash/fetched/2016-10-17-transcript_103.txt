Mayor Burt: (inaudible) Plaza.

Vice Mayor Scharff: Is that Lytton Plaza? That might be Lytton Plaza.
There's another one at the corner of—what is it? There's one at Ramona,
Ramona and University. Lytton Plaza's at Emerson, and then Ramona and
University, there's not. I was just wondering why that's blank.

Mayor Burt: That's a PC also.

Vice Mayor Scharff: That's a PC.

Mr. Lait: Yes.

Vice Mayor Scharff: That's the issue.

Mayor Burt: May I offer that we had elsewhere, like even SurveyMonkey
and things, this question of should we have the requirements under existing
PCs be aligned with the district requirements. I think it's best to do it, and
then we don't have these two sets of rules.

Mr. Lait: We're happy to look into that. I just want to make sure we're fine.

Vice Mayor Scharff: I'd accept that. That's sort of where I was going.

Mayor Burt: "J" would be direct Staff to evaluate aligning existing PC
requirements with the zoning district requirements for these areas.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to add to the Motion, “direct Staff to evaluate
aligning existing Planned Community Zone (PC) requirements with District
requirements.” (New Part J)

Vice Mayor Scharff: I just wanted to clarify. On the Homer and Emerson as
you go into SOFA, that is already—has to be retail in the expanded
definition, but retail or not?

Mr. Lait: If there's retail there now ...

Vice Mayor Scharff: Say there's not retail there now.

Mr. Lait: You can do personal service uses or ...

Vice Mayor Scharff: That's the expanded definition. Someone couldn't put
office there for instance.
