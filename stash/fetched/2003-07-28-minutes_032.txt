Vice Mayor Beecham asked Council Member Lytle if she was making an
amendment for items a and b.

Council Member Lytle replied yes.

Vice Mayor Beecham asked Council Member Ojakian whether that was
acceptable.

Council Member Ojakian said he would not accept the amendment.
The real area for making an exception was eating and drinking, and
an establishment that was 1,500 square feet or less, which was not
very big.

MOTION DIED FOR LACK OF A SECOND

AMENDMENT: Council Member Lytle moved, seconded by Freeman,
to apply items a and b only to the Homer Avenue/Emerson Street
Corridor.

Council Member Lytle said her concern was not about parking but
about fear of loss of the other businesses. As a compromise, could
the one space for every 250-square-foot ratio be allowed throughout
and the restaurant would then only apply in that Corridor.

Council Member Ojakian said one space per 60 square feet.

Council Member Lytle suggested keeping the current zoning, so the
general business service nature of that area would be preserved.

Council Member Freeman said her biggest worry was a high turnover
customer like a “Starbucks” type establishment would come into the
1,500-square-foot building. The Director of Planning and Community
Environment had said a “Starbucks” type establishment was not
considered “eating and drinking”.

Council Member Ojakian suggested there be some kind of a
mechanism for reporting back periodically so people could be
comfortable with what was happening.

Council Member Burch summarized where the available parking was
located. Whole Foods had the most parking. Most of the parking was
in the street area. Parking garages were being put on Bryant and High
Streets. No business would go in if there were not enough parking for
their customers.
