Mayor Shepherd did not believe the language regarding disruption was
needed.     Downtown was under parked, and parking had to flow into
neighborhoods in order for people to get to work. She referenced potential
legislation requiring businesses with more than 50 employees to have a TDM
Program. She preferred 55 percent for the neighborhood support threshold.

Council Member Klein inquired about a date for Staff to return with a
timetable.

Mr. Keene reported March 3, 2014.

Council Member Holman suggested a trial program begin no later than
January 1, 2015. Typically Council direction was not so prescriptive.

Mr. Keene interpreted the language as no later than January 1, 2015.

Council Member Klein did not want merchants to work on modifications to a
trial program between November 15, 2014 and January 1, 2015.

Council Member Holman inquired whether Staff would return earlier if the
work could be completed earlier.

Mr. Keene believed work could be accomplished sooner.
