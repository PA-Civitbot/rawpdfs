Council Member Kniss: Pat, Karen and I both are recollecting doing that.
Maybe our memories are failing us.

Mayor Burt: I read them on Saturday.

Council Member Kniss: If you didn't see it in there, then we didn't do it.

Mayor Burt: I'm just trying to figure out what would be the simplest way to
get it as one of our adopted initiatives on that and then carry it out. Jim's
going to figure it out somehow.

Council Member Kniss: Included in that health fair was something about
getting enough sleep at night.

Mayor Burt: Some of us actually have early morning business meetings.

Adjournment: The meeting was adjourned at 12:29 A.M.
