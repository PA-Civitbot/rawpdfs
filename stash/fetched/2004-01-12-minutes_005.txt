Council Member Freeman asked whether staff had approached the federal
government for their portion of funding for the Mountain View/Moffett Area
Water Recycling Facility as a way to reduce Palo Alto’s cumulative $2.7
million share, since they were one of the largest recipient’s of the recycling
pipeline.

Director of Public Works Glenn Roberts said Moffett Field was under federal
jurisdiction. Staff had very preliminary discussions with the cities of
Sunnyvale and Mountain View about the possibility of federal funding. Staff
would continue in their efforts to attempt to get federal funding and/or
federal or state grants to reduce the share of the cost.
