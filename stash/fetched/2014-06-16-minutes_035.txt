Ms. Byerly stated the firm went into the polling process very conservatively.
They based their process on the last 6 elections.

Council Member Price asked if the Ballot language included the current TOT
amount for voter clarity.

Ms. Stump did not believe the Ballot question had the actual numbers for the
existing or proposed TOT amounts.

Council Member Holman asked for clarification on the TOT taxes with respect
to Airbnb.

Ms. Stump clarified the clean-up language stated if the person was a broker
who facilitated short-term rentals under 30-days the guest would be
responsible for paying the tax. The broker had the responsibility of collecting
the tax from the guest or the facility and if they failed the City would collect
the funds from the broker.

Council Member Klein mentioned the Council had voted to fund the Public
Safety Building from other sources which was why as mentioned by a citizen
it was not included in the Ballot question as a sample of expended funds.
