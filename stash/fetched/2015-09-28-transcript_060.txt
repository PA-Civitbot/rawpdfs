Council Member DuBois: Yeah. Again, I'm trying to say there would be two
networks in the ground. One that would be City-owned and one that is
privately owned.

Vice Mayor Schmid: The City would not be just the last connection to the
house, but would also be a network.

Council Member DuBois: Connect to our backbone. Yeah.

Vice Mayor Schmid: Do you need to be clear on that? It's only conduit to
the premise and the infrastructure.

Mayor Holman: Do you have language you care to offer?

Vice mayor Schmid: To the premise and the infrastructure.

Mayor Holman:    Can you highlight exactly where because it's a very long
motion?

Vice Mayor Schmid: We're talking about "F." Own conduit to the premise
and ...

Council Member DuBois: Do you want to say "own conduit and fiber"? Is
that ...

Vice Mayor Schmid: I'm concerned that we're not just talking about the last
100 feet to the household, but we are connecting to a City-owned fiber
network.

Council Member DuBois: Yeah, that would be up to us to do, but it wouldn't
be part of a co-build. If that makes sense.

Mayor Holman:    Does that reach the clarity you're looking for Vice Mayor
Schmid?

Vice Mayor Schmid: Okay.

Council Member Berman: I have a couple more questions. I'm not that
familiar with what a "dig once" ordinance is, but I'm content to just kind of
have that conversation when Staff comes back with that ordinance proposal.
I guess this is a question for the consultants or for Staff. Direct Staff to
                                                                      Page 60 of 130
