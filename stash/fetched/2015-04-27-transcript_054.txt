Council Member Wolbach: (inaudible) already said purpose.

Council Member Burt: There's a little repetition down at the bottom. I see
it.

Mayor Holman: City Clerk, you want to keep "along with a proposed
purpose and scope of the Comprehensive Plan Advisory Committee." Delete
everything in between.

Council Member Burt: Got it.

Mayor Holman: That's good. Are we there?

Council Member Burt: Where we have "Direct the City Manager and Staff to
form," I would say "to select."

Mayor Holman: I want to keep the word "form" there, because we can have
input. "Form" is a better selection of words.

Council Member Burt: What do you mean by "input" then? Is that a work
around against what I spoke against?

Mayor Holman: No.

Council Member Burt: What do you mean?

Mayor Holman: If you use the word "select," it sounds as though ...

Council Member Burt: What do you mean by "form?"

Mayor Holman: Form is to coalesce.

Council Member Burt: I don't know what that means. To create it, you're
saying?

Mayor Holman: "To create" then. How is that word?

Council Member Burt: I'm just trying to ask now. Let's slow down on the
changes. I'm asking what's meant here and then I can come back with what
I agree or don't agree with. Iâ€™m trying to understand what you mean by
"form." Is it to select? We're going to be doing the purpose and the scope.
What is there to the forming that is different from selecting?

Mayor Holman: It seems like we're deferring the whole selection process to
City Manager and Staff without Council input.
