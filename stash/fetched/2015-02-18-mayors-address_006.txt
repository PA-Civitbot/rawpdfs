Slide 148,209

This is our daytime population including Stanford.

Slide   8,271

8,271 is the number of acres of parks, preserves and open space we are
privileged to have – thanks to the generosity of the likes of Dr. Russell Lee and the
foresight of so many others.




This is, of course, the Lucy Evans Interpretative Center in the Baylands.

Slide   35,383

I don’t know how many would imagine this is the number of street and park trees. Note
this does not even include trees in open space.

The Palo Alto Woman’s Club, dating back to the early part of the 20th century, helped
protect our canopy. They fought against a movement to remove trees that ended up in
the unfortunate location of newly created streets, laid out to accommodate automobiles.
They also carried water barrels on wagons around town to water young trees. And now
we can thank Canopy for advising us and planting new trees. And, of course, in the
interim, many dedicated leaders have acted as stewards of our canopy.

Slide   $1,800,000

Median home price is perhaps a result of our weather, schools, jobs….perhaps also due
to our trees and open spaces. We can’t know the direct reason but the median home
price is as you see here.

Slide   $3,560

And the average monthly rental cost for a 2-bedroom unit is $3,560 currently.
