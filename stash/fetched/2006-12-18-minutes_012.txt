AGENDA CHANGES, ADDITIONS, AND DELETIONS

11b. (Old Item No. 6) Resolution 8680 entitled “Resolution of the Council of
the City of Palo Alto Supporting Participation in ICLEI’s Cities for Climate
Protection® Campaign and Pledging to Undertake the Campaign’s Five
Milestones to Reduce Local Greenhouse Gas Emissions that Contribute to
Global Warming”

Council Member Klein said he believed City staff opposed membership in the
aforementioned organization at one time. He inquired whether Palo Alto was
currently a member.

Senior Resource Planner Karl Knapp said City staff had submitted an
application and paid the required fees to become a member of ICLEI;
however, part of joining the Cities for Climate Protection involved the
adoption of a formal resolution to join one of their campaigns.

Council Member Klein clarified the City was a member of ICLEI, and the
Council was being asked to approve an additional sum in order to become
eligible for further services.

Mr. Knapp said no. The Council was being asked to formally adopt the five
milestones by enacting a resolution.
