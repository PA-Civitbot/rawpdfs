Ms. French: Staff did not go and interview the neighbors who were still
within the boundary to see if they were in favor of that.

Council Member Berman: Thanks.

Mayor Burt: I just had a question on—Council Member Holman. Sorry.

Council Member Holman: A clarifying question about two things. One is if
someone currently has a two-story home, but they want to redevelop, would
they be allowed to redevelop as a two-story home because they already are
a two-story home or would they have to redevelop as a single-story home?

Ms. French: Willful destruction versus a fire of some sort, this is where we
get into it.

Council Member Holman: Yes, willful.

Ms. French: If they were to tear down their house in a willful manner, what
would be put back would be a one-story home.

Council Member Holman: It's not clear to me—I'm sorry. The white or non-
colored, not striped and not green parcels, what does that mean?

Ms. French: It means ...

Council Member Holman: They didn't respond?

Ms. French: ... that they were not a yes, and it means that they, therefore,
never submitted a reversal. They declined to sign the petition supporting.

Council Member Holman: We don't know if they're yeses or noes. They're
just non-responding.

Ms. French: It's assumed no.

Council Member Holman: Thank you.

Mayor Burt: Can you clarify that under our regulations, we don't have a no
vote. We only require affirmatives to ...

Ms. French: We require evidence of signatures of one of the property
owners of each of the properties to affirm their support of the single-story
overlay.

Mayor Burt: Thank you. This tract falls under the 60 percent threshold,
because it has CC&Rs. Is that correct?
