Mayor Holman: I could accept doing it then. With that ...

Council Member Burt: The Clerk needs to know it's withdrawn then, if that's
the case.

Mayor Holman: That's what I intended. I withdraw the motion then.
Council Member DuBois, did you have something?

Council Member DuBois: Are we saying that L-8 is left open until January
and it's going to come back to us? There's no direction to CAC around L-8
itself?

Mayor Holman: Yes, because we already passed another motion regarding
L-8, having to do with pacing.

Council Member DuBois: It was kind of a subset of L-8.

Mayor Holman: There's nothing up on the screen. I think we are completed
and all our motions and substitutes and amendments and all of thatâ€”there's
nothing. With that, we conclude this item.
