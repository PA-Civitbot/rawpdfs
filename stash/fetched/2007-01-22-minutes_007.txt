MOTION: Council Member Barton moved, seconded by Morton, to take the
following actions: 1) Determine that Stanford University has complied in

a) the Agreement remains in effect, and b) Stanford University is not in
default.

Council Member Morton suggested the motion should not be contingent on
the positive results from the staff follow up.

the path violated the Development Agreement.
