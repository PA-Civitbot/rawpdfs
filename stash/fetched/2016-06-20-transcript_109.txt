Council Member Holman: I've been enthusiastic about this ever since I was
liaison to the Parks and Rec Commission inâ€”I think it was 2012, I believe it
was, when I heard the presentation and got very excited about the plan, not
just for the course but also for what I hope to be seeing forthcoming before
too long at least, the originally designed Eichler clubhouse and pro shop.
They're really beautiful and perfect for this kind of setting. Council Member
Kniss and I have been enthusiastic supporters of the Healthy City Priority
that the Council has. I think a golf course is something almost like no other
sport. It's ageless; people can participate from the very young, even
                                                                            Page 109 of 116
