ORAL COMMUNICATIONS

Neilson Buchanan spoke regarding quality standards for Downtown North.
The most obvious concern was parking. Of 1,600 available parking spaces,
1,200 were filled during the week. He hoped the Council would provide a
definitive solution promptly.

Wynn Grcich reported water from the Crystal Springs reservoir was used to
flush a chloramine spill from a nearby creek. She preferred drinking the
toxin-free water. Water quality reports were misleading regarding the level
of lead in water.

Ken Alsman believed the March 18, 2013 Council Agenda could include a
Developer request to use City-owned land to build parking for his private
use. He requested the Council not consider the request.
