Mr. Aknin indicated the methodology changes for Downtown were
implemented. The changes for California Avenue could be implemented in a
short timeframe.

Council Member Price inquired about a rationale for deferring changes for
California Avenue.

Mr. Aknin felt Staff focused on Downtown because of the greater parking
issue.

Council Member Price suggested Staff consider all neighborhoods adjacent to
commercial corridors.

Council Member Holman did not see a Condition of Approval for Agenda Item
Number 11 regarding a Transportation Demand Management (TDM)
program.

Mr. Aknin reported no TDM requirement was associated with architectural
review.

Council Member Holman inquired whether the item needed to be removed
from the Consent Calendar in order to request the applicant implement a
TDM program to the project.

Mr. Aknin stated without the applicant agreeing to a TDM program, there
was no nexus to require a TDM program.

Council Member Holman asked if the Council needed to remove the item
from the Consent Calendar to request the applicant agree to a TDM
program.

Ms. Stump did not believe the Council's approval would preclude Staff from
having discussions with the applicant. However, she needed to review the
Council's ability to impose a requirement when the project was Code
compliant.

Mr. Keene did not believe the item had to be removed from the Consent
Calendar.

Mayor Scharff felt the item did have to be removed from the Consent
Calendar.

Council Member Holman felt a Council vote in support of a TDM program
would indicate the Council's desire for a TDM program for the project.
