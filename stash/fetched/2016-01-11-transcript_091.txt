Vice Mayor Scharff:   Okay.   You can add that peak hour; that's perfectly
fine.

Mayor Burt: That's acceptable to the seconder?

Council Member Kniss: Yes.

INCORPORATED INTO MOTION2 WITH THE CONSENT OF THE MAKER
AND SECONDER to add to the Motion, “the Traffic Demand Management
(TDM) program will be designed to reduce single occupancy vehicle trips by
20 percent during the peak hour.” (new Part G)

Mayor Burt: Anything else?

Vice Mayor Schmid:    Is that singular or plural?   Is it one hour or is it the
morning commute?

Ms. Gitelman: One peak hour.

Mayor Burt: What we really mean is both of the peak periods of the day. I
would agree that it should be the A.M. and P.M. peak hours. Is that ...

Vice Mayor Scharff: That's how I understood it.          I think the Planning
Director was making a joke actually.

MOTION2 PART G RESTATED: The Traffic Demand Management (TDM)
program will reduce motor vehicle trips by 20 percent during A.M. and P.M.
peak hours.

Council Member Schmid: The way the Planning Director stated it, she left
out the design, said "will reduce."

Mayor Burt: Sorry? What'd you say?

Council Member Schmid: The Planning Director left out the words "be
designed to." Said "will reduce single occupancy vehicle trips."

Ms. Gitelman: That's right. I didn't say "single occupancy vehicle." I said
"motor vehicle trips."

Mayor Burt: By including or not including the words "be designed to," if
they're not there, what does it mean to you?

Ms. Gitelman: Not including "be designed to." This is the performance
standard we're going to hold them to, however they get there.
