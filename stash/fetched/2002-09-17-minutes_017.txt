Council Member Morton said that exemption was what the Council
would like staff to review.

Director of Planning and Community Environment Stephen Emslie
clarified that staff was directed to return to the Council with
changes to the housing fee so the shares of mixed-use projects
attributable to commercial fees and residential fees paid the
appropriate amounts of each, without averaging or exempting
those fees.

Council Member Morton said that was correct.

Mr. Emslie said staff would try to incorporate the changes to
the housing fees with those related to the BMR program already
scheduled to return to the Council.

AMENDMENT   PASSED   7-0,   Kleinberg   “not   participating,”   Mossar
absent.

AMENDMENT: Council Member Beecham moved, seconded by Kishimoto,
to establish 1,500-square-foot units for one-time development
impact fees and exempt all ground floor commercial units.

Council Member Beecham said the purpose of the amendment was to
encourage a strong ground floor element within the community.

Council Member Kishimoto asked whether the exemption was limited
to zoning, which required ground floor retail, or did it also
include ground floor retail that could be converted to other
uses.

Council Member Beecham said he wanted to limit it to those areas
that required ground floor uses.

Council Member Morton opposed the amendment because the benefit
of ground floor retail went to the owner of the building, not
the tenant.

Council Member Kishimoto asked the maker of the amendment
whether the intention was to limit the exemption fees for ground
floor retail to a permanent requirement or easement.

Council Member Beecham said his intention was to have the
exemption apply only to those areas that required ground floor
retail.

Council Member Burch clarified the amendment on the floor was an
exemption of all ground floor retail.
