Council Member Kleinberg concurred with Council Member Cordell’s
comments. She asked whether Ms. Coleman’s statement was correct in
saying the Junior Museum and Zoo staff were in agreement of the project
moving in the right direction.

Ms. Harrison said no.

Council Member Kleinberg said the Council was moving in the direction of
having staff examine the business model and development program without
evaluating the competency of the organization that would run the program.
Several major policy decisions had been overlooked and not publicly
discussed with the Council, such as organization competency and
composition, roles and responsibilities, fiduciary responsibilities, and
stewardship of public facilities. She was not convinced of the urgency to
move forward due to the uniqueness of the situation.

MOTION PASSED 5-3 Kleinberg, Cordell, Morton no, Barton absent.
