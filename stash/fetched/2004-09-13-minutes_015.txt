Council Member Cordell asked whether the concept was in Council Member
Mossar’s memo, which indicated improvements of water, greenery, and
seating.

Council Member Mossar confirmed that was the concept.             She said
preliminary studies did not provide detailed plans.

Council Member Cordell said Lytton Plaza was not one of the Top 5 priorities
for the City and there were many other projects where the monies could be
dedicated.

Council Member Morton suggested a change of words from “verification” to
“establish” cost estimates.

Council Member Kishimoto said she had questions about the sketch from the
previous study. She asked the meaning of a public/private partnership and
an explanation for the distinction between a partnership and a donation of
$250,000.

Ms. Harrison said the Council policy referred to private or non-profit
organizations that went forward with a proposal to improve City-owned
property.

Council Member Kishimoto asked whether the private partner was the
initiator of the first design.

Ms. Harrison said the policy contemplated it either way; however, the
private sector usually approached the City.

Council Member Kishimoto asked whether the public had access to the Plaza
24 hours a day.

Ms. Harrison said the focus would be on the Plaza as dedicated parkland.

Council Member Kishimoto said when the proposal went to the PARC, it
should go with no restraints, and she asked whether it would be the concept
of the private partner or from the earlier concept.

Ms. Harrison said she would ask staff to review both concepts.

Council Member Kishimoto asked whether operating and maintenance costs
would be examined.

Council Member Freeman said she was conflicted about the acceptance of
funds from the private party.
