would motivate the community to review better solutions. If traffic and
parking issues improved through other initiatives, the Council could be
willing to institute a moderately higher cap. He wanted a tool that would
allow the Council to differentiate among detrimental projects.      Some
exceptions in Zoning Ordinances were good, and some should be
reconsidered. He would not support the Motion or Substitute Motion. If
neither passed, then the Council should schedule a follow-up meeting after
framing the issues.

INCORPORATED INTO THE SUBSTITUTE MOTION WITH THE
CONSENT OF THE MAKER AND SECONDER to change “10,000 sq. ft.” to
“20,000 sq. ft.”

Council Member Scharff agreed with Council Member Burt for the most part.
Allowing 175 square feet would provide a third more parking. The cost of
the additional parking was the equivalent of a moratorium. The proposed
development cap was also the equivalent of a moratorium. The Council
needed to think through the issues. The City needed to work on congestion
and target SOV rates. The Council was focused on implementing initiatives
to improve traffic and parking problems. The City needed new revenues to
focus on initiatives.

INCORPORATED INTO THE SUBSTITUTE MOTION WITH THE
CONSENT OF THE MAKER AND SECONDER to change in Section A “125
sq. ft.” to “175 sq. ft.”

Council Member Wolbach would not support the Substitute Motion. The
Substitute Motion as amended was intended to be a moratorium. Office
development should be slowed because of its negative impacts.         If a
development project could mitigate all its negative impacts, it should be
approved.

Council Member Berman would not support the Substitute Motion.

Mayor Holman believed the Substitute Motion attempted to accomplish too
many objectives. Some exceptions in the Zoning Ordinance were beneficial
and should not be abolished. She favored preservation of retail space. The
Council did not have sufficient data to propose a number for item a).

SUBSTITUTE MOTION AS AMENDED FAILED:                 3-6 DuBois, Filseth,
Schmid yes

SUBSTITUTE MOTION: Council Member Scharff moved, seconded by
Council Member Berman to direct Staff to return with:
