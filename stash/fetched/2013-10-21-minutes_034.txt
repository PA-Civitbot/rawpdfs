Council Member Schmid asked why the study would not utilize point-to-point
measurements as recommended by the ITE and as used in Menlo Park's
latest traffic study.

Mr. Aknin indicated the study would consider both intersections and roadway
segments. The measurements pertained to the intersections themselves.
Another consideration was determining how intersections operated for
pedestrians and bicyclists.

MOTION TO CALL THE QUESTION:               Council Member Burt moved,
seconded by Vice Mayor Shepherd to call the question.

MOTION TO CALL THE QUESTION PASSED:               6-2 Schmid, Holman no,
Klein absent

MOTION PASSED: 7-1 Schmid no, Klein absent

ADJOURNMENT: The meeting was adjourned at 11:39 P.M.
