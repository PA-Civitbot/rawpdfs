Donna Grider, City Clerk reported the Council directed the matter regarding
1095 Channing Avenue be set for public hearing on December 17, 2012
rather than on the Consent Calendar. Notice appeared in the newspaper the
previous Friday as required by the Government Code.

Wynn Grcich referenced newspaper articles indicating breast cancer had
increased in the Bay area. Iodine radiation was the leading cause of breast
cancer. New studies indicated mammography could be the problem. Autism
and lower IQs were caused by radiation.

CONSENT CALENDAR

Council Member Holman noted that she would not participate in Agenda
Item Number 5 because she had a membership in the Golf and Country
Club. She also registered a no vote on Agenda Item Number 8.

Molly Stump, City Attorney stated that two current Council Members
typically recused themselves for items that impact Stanford University. She
stated Agenda Item Number 9 was related to the co-generation plant and
has come to Council before. She said it would be consistent for Council
Members to take the same approach with this item as when it was heard
previously.

Mayor Yeh noted that he would not participate in Agenda Item Number 9
because his wife was a recent student at Stanford University.

Council Member Klein stated Stanford did not have a $100,000 interest in
the issue and therefore it seemed to him there was no conflict.

Ms. Stump asked if he participated the first time the item came before
Council.

Council Member Klein said he did not participate last time.    The current
Agenda Item was a technical change with no financial impact.

Ms. Stump said that was a decision each Council Member could make
independently.
