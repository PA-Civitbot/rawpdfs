COUNCIL COMMENTS, QUESTIONS, AND ANNOUNCEMENTS

Council Member Beecham noted a recent article in the Palo Alto Daily
regarding Palo Alto’s energy contracts and, in particular, Enron, which
contained factual errors, innuendos and false allegations. The Daily has
offered him the opportunity to write a column for Sunday’s paper that would
not be edited and also that there would not be any other editorial comments
on the column on that date.

Council Member Mossar stated there was a summary of San Francisquito
Creek Joint Powers Authority (JPA) activities since inception (May 1999) at
places that evening, which was a good reminder of all the milestones of the
JPA.

Council Member Kishimoto commented on the impressive JPA chronology
and invited her Council colleagues to attend the tour of the San Francisquito
Creek watershed on Saturday May 14, 2005, from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.
