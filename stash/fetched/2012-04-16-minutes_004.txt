8.    Update on the Climate Protection Plan - Earth Day Staff Report.

Debra Van Duynhoven, the Sustainability Manager for the City of Palo Alto,
provided an update on the City’s Sustainability programs and the progress
made towards meeting the City’s GHG reduction goals set by Council. The
2012 GHG emissions reduction goal for municipal operations (also called City
operations) is 20 percent below the 2005 baseline levels. The corresponding
2012 GHG emissions reduction goal for the entire community was set at 5
percent below the 2005 baseline levels. At present, Staff estimates that
emissions from City operations could be reduced by 27 percent by the end of
2012, and community emissions could be reduced by 15 percent by the end
of 2012. These projected reductions far exceed the goals set for 2012 and
reaches the 2020 community reduction goal of 15 percent. These estimated
reductions will be primarily achieved with greater purchases of electricity
from renewable supplies, greater participation in the PaloAltoGreen program
and lower levels of waste to the landfill.
