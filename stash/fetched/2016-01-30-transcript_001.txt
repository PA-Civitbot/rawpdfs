Mayorâ€™s Welcome and Overview of the Day

Mayor Burt: Welcome, everyone, to the 2016 City Council Retreat for
Priority setting and related matters. We have agendas. I hope everybody
has seen, as they walked in, the pink-sheet agenda and related materials.
As you'll see from it, we have really four segments to this. The first is laying
the groundwork through the presentation by our City Auditor of the 2016
Performance Report and National Citizen Survey, which very much will
inform the discussion around the interests of the community and where the
community perceives that we are as a City today and where we should be
going, what we need to address the most. Second, we'll go into our Priority
setting which will begin with an overview essentially of some of the major
things that were accomplished or in progress last year, and how that is
setting the stage for where we are headed this year. Also a discussion
around really the process that we'll be using in this discussion today, and
then a Priority setting exercise by the Council with somewhat of a
presumption that given this is the same Council as we had last year, that we
are not expecting radical changes to our Priority setting. After lunch, we will
have a discussion around really how we would accomplish the work plan for
the year and what can be accomplished within the resources we have and
how we reconcile the Priorities with really our ability to get stuff done. Then,
we'll have a final discussion around what special meetings the Council wants
to have this year to address policy issues that really should be discussed
outside of a regular agendized meeting and trying to cram these things into
an hour within those regular meetings, but instead to have the opportunity
to be able to have thoughtful discussions and deeper considerations of some
of these important issues that we're wanting to grapple with this coming
