Council Member Scharff requested Staff determine whether violation would
necessarily result in a misdemeanor. He preferred a violation result in an
infraction. He also wanted the provision to define penalties.

Ms. Silver advised that the City Attorney had discretion to charge a violation
as an infraction. Staff could retain the provision with that discretion or
revise the provision to an infraction.

Council Member Scharff preferred the provision be revised to an infraction.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER change misdemeanor penalty to an infraction in
Section 10.50.100.

Vice Mayor Kniss was concerned about the time and whether more changes
would be proposed. The Council should approve the Ordinance. There
would be problems and changes. Eventually RPP Programs would be perfect
and create change in the community.

Council Member Burt asked if Resolutions would address transfer of permits.

Ms. Sullivan replied yes.

Council Member Burt recalled Council Member Holman's comments regarding
alternative language for Section 10.50.010.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER Section 10.50.010 be changed to "parking
programs that appropriately protect each neighborhoodâ€™s unique
characteristics."

Council Member Burt noted Section 10.50.070(d)(7) contained interspersed
references to school events. It was specific about the number of days and
two-block radius. He expected those details to be included in a Resolution.
He requested the City Attorney draft language for a broad description of the
type of events and the frequency of events and for those details to be
included in Resolutions.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER direct the City Attorney to draft language for
Section 10.50.070(d)(7) that included a broad description of types and
frequency of events and that such details would be contained in a
Resolution.
