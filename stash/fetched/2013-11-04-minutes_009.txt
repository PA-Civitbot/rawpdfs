9.   Update from Rail Committee.

Richard Hackmann, Management Analyst, reported the California High Speed
Rail Authority (CHSRA) identified the design build contractor for the initial
construction segment in the Central Valley. No construction had occurred
and construction likely would not begin in 2013. In accordance with Council
direction, Staff continued to oppose High Speed Rail (HSR) because the
project fundamentally contradicted the measure presented to voters under
Proposition 1A. Staff continued to work with the City's legislative advocate
to track legislation and to advocate on behalf of the City. Staff continued to
work with Caltrain and other regional agencies to communicate City
positions and remained involved in stakeholder meetings. On November 8,
2013, there would be a significant hearing on litigation. In November and
December 2013, Caltrain would begin installation of the Communications
Based Overlay Signal System (CBOSS) in Palo Alto. In late 2013 or early
                                                                              Page 9 of 24
