Ms. Arpan said BIDs needed to be reauthorized annually. Starting in May
2004, authorization for fiscal year July 1, 2004 to June 30, 2005 would be
implemented.

Council Member Kleinberg asked about the legal role of the BID as a
501(c)(3) corporate status.

Ms. Arpan said the Board of Directors would make the decisions regarding
the operation of the BID, and the City Council would authorize the BID
annually.

Council Member Kleinberg said the Council would partner and subsidize the
BID to some extent.     She acknowledged the BID would be its own
organization and not a City run organization except as an annual
reauthorization.

Ms. Arpan said she would prepare the annual reauthorization and work with
the BID.

Mr. Benest said a separate Board would operate the BID.
