AMENDMENT PASSED: 9-0

Mayor Espinosa stated one of the fundamental approaches of the
proposal was the location of the bicycle lanes. He inquired whether
there were any considerations on placing the bike lane in the center of
the street.

Mr. Rodriquez stated there were currently no bike lanes proposed on
California Avenue. The proposal currently contained share-arrows to
delineate the street. Share-arrows encouraged vehicles and bicyclists
to share the street. Staff was currently updating the Pedestrian and
Bicycle Master Plan. An alternative was to provide additional bicycle
lanes on Sherman Avenue or Cambridge Avenue. Staff’s intent was to
formulate a cost effective design while staying within the existing curb
to curb right-of-way.
