Council Member Freeman asked when the Saffron Club would break even.

Mr. Fellman said the Saffron Club would break even in the sixth year.

Council Member Morton said the choice was for a tenant that would be best
for the community.

Council Member Kishimoto said she would support the substitute motion
because the overall impact on the Downtown community needed to be taken
into consideration.

Council Member Ojakian asked Mr. Baum whether it would be possible in a
lease agreement to place a quota on the type of users that would use the
facility, such as teens.

Mr. Baum said the lease was based on terms already in place. There could
be voluntary agreements or conditions reached. He added the applicant
could make a commitment to the City and to the Council on the issue.

Council Member Ojakian said Council Member Morton spoke strongly about
the matter and said he would support asking staff to work with the
applicant.

AMENDMENT: Council Member Ojakian moved, seconded by Freeman, to
direct staff to work with the applicant to create an arrangement for up to
one-third membership to be designated for teens and younger.

Council Member Freeman said she would be open to flexibility in the one-
third-membership number.

Council Member Morton said a portion of the usage should not be
segregated.

Council Member Kleinberg said the amendment created a classification and
the business plan should not be changed.

Council Member Ojakian said it was a mistake for the Council to politicize a
bid process, and he would not support the motion.

Council Member Kishimoto said Council Member Ojakianâ€™s motion was to ask
staff during the option period to negotiate as many community benefits as
possible. She would support Form Fitness because of the verbal commitment
made to serving the youth.
