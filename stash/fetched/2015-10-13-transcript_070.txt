Council Member DuBois: I haven't touched it.

Mayor Holman: It just automatically pops up. I think we have a motion in
front of us that we can vote on. That passes unanimously with Council
Member Kniss absent.

MOTION AS AMENDED PASSED: 8-0 Kniss absent

Mayor Holman: Not bad, it's 10:02. That concludes our agenda items. I
had said earlier that I would like to adjourn this meeting in honor of Former
Mayor Dick Rosenbaum. Council Member Rosenbaum passed away this
weekend at the age of 81. He was on the City Council from 1971 to 1975
and again from 1992 to 1999. He served as Mayor in 1998. To add to his
years of community service, he also served on the Utilities Advisory
Commission from 2000 to 2009. He also served in a number of other roles
on nonprofit boards in the community. Just in elected and appointed roles
and official roles, he had 20 years of community service. I would like to
close this meeting in his honor.

Adjournment: The meeting was adjourned at 10:03 P.M. in memory of
Former Mayor Richard Rosenbaum who passed away on October 11, 2015.
