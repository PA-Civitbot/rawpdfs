when a gun could be pulled.

Mr. Larkin stated there is a distinction between a gun being drawn and a gun
being used. A gun could be drawn when an officer is unaware of what is
around a corner and that would not be considered a lethal force situation.

Council Member Cordell clarified that Tasers would be limited             to
circumstances under which the use of lethal force would be permitted.

Chief Johnson stated a member from the TTF wanted to make a comment.

Darryl Savage stated her concern was whether the Council read the minutes
from the TTF meetings. The TTF voted seven to two in favor of the Tasers.
She stated that in each situation, officers do not know what will happen and
it should not be limited to only lethal force.

AMENDMENT TO SUBSTITUTE MOTION:               Vice Mayor Klein moved,
seconded by Morton, to define that the use of Tasers would be limited to
those situations in which a gun may be drawn.

Mr. Baum stated this is an amendment to the substitute motion and you can
only have one amendment to the substitute motion. He stated he did not
understand the motion. He asked what was meant by situations where you
would draw a gun.

Mr. Larkin stated the standards of when you can draw a gun are not
consistent with the use of force standards

Chief Johnson stated there are many situations where an officer could draw
their gun such as a prowler in a backyard, or a fight that broke out and
people have weapons.

Vice Mayor Klein asked whether she would be comfortable in those situations
with an officer using a Taser.

Chief Johnson answered yes.

AMENDMENT TO THE SUBSTITUTE MOTION PASSED 5-4 Cordell,
Kishimoto, Kleinberg, Mossar no.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION AS AMENDED PASSED 5-4 Drekmeier, Kishimoto,
