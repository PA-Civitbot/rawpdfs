Mayor Holman: Our first item on the agenda tonight is actually Item
Number 19, to consider a continued appeal of the Director of Planning and
Community Environment's architectural review approval of a 31,407 square-
foot, four-story, mixed-use building with parking facilities on two
subterranean levels on an 11,000-square-foot site in the Downtown
Commercial Zone located at 429 University Avenue and approval of a
mitigated negative declaration. This is a quasi-judicial, so if any Council
Members have anything to declare? Council Members? I did have a brief
conversation with a couple of members of the public, not the appellant or
the applicant. Seeing no other lights, that is it. We'll go to Staff for a
presentation.
