AGENDA CHANGES, ADDITIONS, AND DELETIONS

20A. (Old Item 13) Approval of a Contract with Group 4 Architecture,
     Research Planning, Inc., in the amount of $257,325 for Architectural
     and Engineering Design Services for the Mitchell Park Library Space
     Study – Capital Improvement Program Project PE-07011

Council Member Klein asked what the $257,325 covered and how beneficial
would it be to move forward with the project. He said the proposed cost
ranged between $61,000 and $199,000. The amount being requested for
approval was $234,000 with an additional contingency of $24,000. He
questioned the $50,000 discrepancy.

Public Works Director Glenn Roberts said the proposed cost was for
professional services and was not a bid. The proposals in the $61,000 to
$80,000 or lower-end range did not have the concept or relationship to the
work needed. Group 4 ranked highest in terms of the quality of the
proposal, knowledge of the site, and the ability to complete the project
within the Council’s mandated timeframe.         Consequential issues were
addressed at the Main and Downtown Libraries to rebuild Mitchell Park
Library, which increased the scope above the original proposal.        The
contingency item was added to cover unforeseen issues, which may arise,
and was subject to specific authorization as needed.

Mr. Roberts advised staff is preparing for a bond measure in the future and
this work builds towards that ultimate goal. This work goes into more detail
