     DISCUSSION:
     The City of Palo Alto has been classified by the California Department of Conservation (DOC),
     Division of Mines and Geology (DMG) as a Mineral Resource Zone 1 (MRZ-1). This designation
     signifies that there are no aggregate resources in the area. The DMG has not classified the City for
     other resources. There is no indication in the 2010 Comprehensive Plan that there are locally or




                                                                                                                                               Attachment: Attachment A: Negative Declaration - CEQA Check List (1320 : California Avenue Neg Dec and CIP)
     regionally valuable mineral resources within the City of Palo Alto.

     Mitigation Measures: None Required.
