Council Member Klein asked if the rental charge was the only downside.

Mr. Roberts said yes.

INCORPORATED INTO MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE MAKER
AND SECONDER as part of the plan when returning in October that Staff is
to advise Council if selling compost is profitable and to include Staff costs in
the total costs.

MOTION PASSED: 7-0 Espinosa, Yeh absent

Mayor Burt advised he would combine discussion of Agenda Item Nos. 4 & 5
to be heard at the same time.

4.   Approval of a Contract with Alternative Resources Inc. in the Total
     Amount Not To Exceed $197,758 for Energy/Compost Feasibility Study
     and Environmental Impact Initial Study. (Item continued from August 2,
      2010)

5.    Utilities Advisory Commission Recommendation that Council Approve
      the Use of Up to $75,000 in Calaveras Reserve Funds to Partially Fund
      a $250,000 Energy/Compost Feasibility Study and Environmental
      Impact Initial Study. (Item continued from August 2, 2010)

Public Works Director, Glenn Roberts said the item was being brought back
to the Council resulting from a policy correction for Staff to perform the
Study and establish a timeline by early 2011 as recommended by the Blue
Ribbon Compost Task Force (Task Force).

Council Member Shepherd asked how would the anaerobic digestion facility
fit in time wise if there was another year before a Council election.

Mr. Roberts said he did not have a direct answer, but the direction Staff was
following was the Council wanted to be able to respond to a potential ballot
measure or initiative in the Fall 2011 Ballot regarding the future of an
anaerobic digestion (AD) facility.

Council Member Schmid said at the April 5 meeting the Motion was to follow
the Staffâ€™s recommendation to pursue local partnering opportunities or
organic waste companies for developing a private AD or energy conversion
facilities.
