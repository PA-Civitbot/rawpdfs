Mayor Scharff did not agree to split the Motion.

AMENDMENT:         Council Member Schmid moved, seconded by Council
Member Holman to remove part one in the Motion, “return to Council in June
with a review of the proposal for a private-public parking garage on Lot P,”
and direct Staff to return to Council in June to review a range of financing
options for downtown parking.

Council Member Schmid heard a number of Council Members identify the
need to explore a range of financing options. Rather than returning with one
option, Staff could identify a range of financing possibilities for the Council to
explore.

Mayor Scharff inquired whether Council Member Schmid's Amendment
excluded a review of the public-private partnership for Lot P.

Council Member Schmid indicated a public-private partnership for Lot P could
be one option.

Mayor Scharff suggested a review of financing options could be added as
part 4 of the Motion.

Mr. Keene stated the proposal for Lot P needed to be assessed.

Vice Mayor Shepherd did not believe Council Member Schmid wished to
remove review of the proposal for Lot P.

Council Member Schmid felt the Council needed to review a range of
financing options as part of the parking issue.

Mayor Scharff asked if Council Member Schmid would make the review of
financing options part 4 of the Motion.

Council Member Schmid wished to substitute it for part 1 of the Motion.

Mayor Scharff inquired whether the Amendment precluded Staff from
returning with a review of the proposal for Lot P.

Council Member Schmid suggested Staff include the proposal as an example
of a financing option.
