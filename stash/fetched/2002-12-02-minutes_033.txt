AMENDMENT: Council Member Beecham moved, seconded by Morton, in
Program H-5, page 10, second bullet under New Development Standards
and Zoning Districts, change third line from “standards that provide the
maximum amount of housing” to “standards that allow the maximum
amount of housing.”

Vice Mayor Mossar asked whether changing “provide” to “allow” change the
intent of the bullet point.

Ms. Furth said the change in wording made it clear that the City did not build
housing.

AMENDMENT PASSED 9-0.

AMENDMENT: Council Member Beecham moved, seconded by Morton, to
delete Program H-8 on page 11.

Council Member Beecham said he could support second dwelling units that
were frequently occupied by members or relatives of the main household,
but in general he could not support second dwelling units within what
otherwise were basically single-family homes.

Ms. Furth said the State might have preempted the City on that.

Mayor Ojakian clarified recently passed State Law preempted Program H-8.
Ms. Furth said staff thought it might. There was a requirement for ministerial
review, but the City could not require a conditional use permit or variance on
second units.

AMENDMENT FAILED 2-7, Beecham, Morton “yes.”

AMENDMENT: Council Member Beecham moved, seconded by Morton, in
Policy H-12, Program H-32, page 22, first sentence, change the word
“necessary” to “feasible.”

Mayor Ojakian did not support the motion because there was a dire need to
make sure the Terman Apartments were preserved.

Council Member Burch agreed that the Terman Apartments needed to be
preserved.

Council Member Beecham was not willing to commit the City to buy the
Terman Apartments, if that was the way the wording was interpreted.

AMENDMENT FAILED 3-6, Beecham, Lytle, Morton “yes.”
