Mr. Emslie said the staff recommendation included a one-year evaluation of
the streamlining process. Staff was reluctant to codify the online or email
notification procedures without more experience; however, they would if
asked to do so.

AMENDMENT: Council Member Kishimoto moved, seconded by Freeman, to
encourage early notice and/or communication to the public to the maximum
level possible.

Council Member Freeman said approximately 90 percent of Palo Alto
residents had access to the Internet and/or electronic mail (email). She
believed it was time the City took advantage of that method of
communication. She also suggested looking into active and passive
methodologies.

Council Member Kishimoto clarified the electronic noticing and posting could
be worded as a "courtesy" posting. The legal method of notification would
remain the same.

Mr. Emslie said that would be the understanding.

Council Member Morton said he would not support the amendment. To make
it a legal requirement on how staff communicated with the public would pose
additional challenges.

Vice Mayor Burch said he would support the motion with the understanding
“to the extent possible.”

Ms. Furth said if the Council wished to amend the ordinance, it needed more
specificity.

Mayor Beecham asked Council Member Kishimoto whether it was the intent
of the Council to urge staff to do it or should it be placed in the ordinance.

Council Member Kishimoto said she would ask staff to return by the Second
Reading with wording for the ordinance.

Ms. Furth said if the intent was to give direction to staff for early noticing,
web posting and electronic email, she recommended not putting that
language in the ordinance, but rather give direction to staff following
adoption of the ordinance.
