                              MINUTES
Mr. Rodriguez remarked that the ramp was a community concern as well.
Staff could construct a second ramp closer. Staff proposed a paved section
that would connect back towards Embarcadero Road.

Council Member Scharff felt that would be a better alternative.

Mr. Rodriguez could do that over the summer if the Council approved it.

Council Member Kniss believed the green line on the map was the new bike
route.

Mr. Rodriguez explained that would be the route for traveling east toward
Alma Street.

Council Member Kniss asked if there would be dual bike lanes.

Mr. Rodriguez clarified that an existing bike lane was located on the north
side of the street. The proposal would add a bike lane.

Council Member Kniss inquired whether a right-turn lane was proposed at El
Camino Real.

Mr. Rodriguez answered yes.

Council Member Kniss asked if Caltrans funded improvements to El Camino
Real.

Mr. Rodriguez reported Caltrans did not pay for anything.         If the City
wanted an improvement, the City had to design and fund it.

Council Member Kniss felt many streets would benefit from crossing lights,
and asked how residents could request crossing lights.

 Mr. Rodriguez was always interested in new crosswalks or lights to enhance
existing crosswalks. Residents could contact the Transportation Division and
make a request. The City set aside funds annually for improvements such
as flashing beacons.

Council Member Kniss inquired whether State law designated a crosswalk
without markings as a crosswalk.

Mr. Rodriguez replied yes. A crosswalk at an intersection did not have to be
marked to be defined as a legal crosswalk. From a cost perspective, flashing
beacons were difficult to apply across the City.
