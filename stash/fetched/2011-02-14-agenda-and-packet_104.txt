efforts at the December 3rd meeting. Task force meetings have been scheduled for the
first and third Thursdays of the month at the Lucie Stern Community Center. Staff has
also invited representatives of other stakeholder groups to attend the meetings.
Mountain View and Menlo Park, the neighboring communities along the rail corridor,
and Caltrain were invited to appoint liaisons to attend the meeting.

RESOURCE IMPACT
Funding for the project was allocated by the City Council when the Study was initiated.
$100,000 was budgeted during the 2010-2011 fiscal year. An additional $100,000 was
identified for the project in the 2011-2012 fiscal year.



POLICY IMPLICATIONS
The study will rely on the City’s Comprehensive Plan and other land use transportation
policies to guide the effort for the corridor.

ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW
Approving a contract for the study is not considered a project requiring environmental
review per the California Environmental Quality Act. It is anticipated that future
environmental review for the Rail Corridor Plan would be completed as part of the
Comprehensive Plan Environmental Impact Report.
