Council Member Mossar said it appeared the Council could not postpone
dealing with the issue.

Mr. Benest said staff was working with the County and the Airport Master
Plan.

Mayor Kleinberg said a letter from the Robert Trent Jones Architecture Firm
(attachment “E” of CMR:168:06) indicated a number of assumptions. The
first assumption stated the golf course would continue to serve the same
user groups. She asked where that information came from.

Mr. Emslie said there was not enough information to indicate a different
clientele.

Mayor Kleinberg said the second assumption was the golf course should
maintain its championship status. She asked where that information came
from.

Mr. Emslie said it had always been the goal to build a soccer field while
maintaining the golf course’s championship status.

Mayor Kleinberg asked how much more yardage was there that was not
included in the study.

Mr. Emslie said it was a significant number.

Mayor Kleinberg said there was no discussion of building up berms and the
type of design that included built-in safety nets.

Mr. Emslie said no specific design features were outlined. The topography,
vegetation and other safety devices would be used in the shorter course to
promote safety.

Mayor Kleinberg asked about the developers’ level of municipal golf course
experience.

Mr. Emslie said staff spoke with several developers including Eric
Brandenburg, who developed a private golf course/residential community in
the Evergreen Valley of San Jose, and stated there could be financial
feasibility provided there were a significant number of residential units.

Mayor Kleinberg said staff indicated a financially feasible development of the
golf course and playing fields required a large amount of residential
development offsite. She asked whether the information was based solely on
Mr. Brandenburg’s assessment.
