Mayor Kishimoto asked the City Attorney whether the neighborhood would
be allowed to choose a new appellant or whether the person previously
named as the official appellant would be the speaker.

Mr. Baum said the appellants could choose the speaker, who needed to be a
representative or a previously-named appellant.

Ms. Dijch-Bhodlkamkar stated the neighborhood would like to put the
subdivision on hold until rezoning of the area for 10,000 square foot lots.
She said many homeowners believed the process was flawed.

Council Member Beecham stated any other individuals who wanted to speak
would have his or her own independent three minutes to speak.

Mayor Kishimoto noted there were no more speaker cards and, therefore,
she would move on to the applicants.

Ha Nguyen, 897 Barron Avenue, urged approval of the subdivision, which is
being requested to take care of their parents. There would be two small lots
of approximately 8,000 square feet each and larger than the minimum 6,000
square foot lot size required by the zoning. He reviewed the data of two
storey homes in the neighborhood.

Lieu Nguyen, 897 Barron Avenue, requested approval of the subdivision.

Mayor Kishimoto asked why the applicants would not want to make the
corner lot larger to make more room to save the cedar trees.

Mr. Nguyen stated they would move the house from the current location to
accommodate the cedar trees.

Mrs. Nguyen stated the new house would face the direction of Laguna
Avenue for aesthetics.

Mayor Kishimoto asked Dave Dockter whether the moving of the house
would save the tree.

Managing Arborist Dave Dockter stated he had reviewed the plan and if the
recommended conditions were implemented the plan would be feasible.

Elizabeth Doyle, 3655 LaCalle Court, stated she opposed the subdivision.

Peter Waller stated he opposed the subdivision.

Ed Bugnion, 3675 LaCalle Court, stated he opposed the subdivision.
