MOTION PASSED 4-2, Burch, Ojakian “no,” Freeman, Morton, Mossar
“not participating.”

Council Member Ojakian noted one of the Planning and Transportation
Commissioners was present and asked whether his comments could be
heard.

Vice Mayor Beecham said the public hearing was closed, and boards
and commissions were not formally part of staff. There was no
opportunity for the P&TC to take an action on what the Council did.

Vice Mayor Beecham said the remaining item before the Council was to
verify the map and asked staff what was the best map to work from.

Mr. Emslie said the map was labeled, “South of Forest District Map.”
The recommendation of staff and the P&TC was to proceed with the
map.

Council Member Lytle said if 800 High Street and all historic buildings
were removed, the boundaries were the same. The Working Group cut
out 800 High Street and historic properties. The boundaries of the
Working Group complied with the Comp Plan policy, which meant that
boundaries were drawn down the back side of a parcel rather than
along a street. She suggested using the Working Group boundary for
RT-50, since the difference was historically designated properties in
800 High Street.

Council Member Burch said Ole’s Car Shop, the Peninsula Creamery
Store, property on High Street across from Reach, and the Palo Alto
Weekly would revert to RT-35, which he was opposed to.

MOTION: Council Member Burch moved, seconded by Ojakian, to
accept the staff recommendations for the South of Forest Area District
Map.

Council Member Burch said restricting Ole’s to RT-35 or eliminating the
Peninsula Creamery did not make sense.

Council Member Kishimoto favored the Working Group‘s version. The
Peninsula Creamery building sold its TDR rights to the property across
the street.

Council Member Kleinberg asked what was the delta in terms of units
lost for potential housing if some of the potentially RT-50 properties
