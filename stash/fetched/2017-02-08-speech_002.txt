We are here tonight at a moment, however, when our attention and concerns must

extend beyond Palo Alto.

   •   It is a moment when our awareness that the rights, freedoms and obligations we

       rely upon cannot be taken for granted.




   •   It is a moment when communication in the form of a 140-character Tweet is

       replacing thoughtful discourse on the most important issues facing our nation.




In this environment, it would have been tempting for me to Tweet the State of the City—

but I follow a long line of Palo Alto mayors whose respect for this role, and for the

citizens of our community, has been thoughtfully expressed in what they said at this

event each year. I am honored to be among them and to have the opportunity tonight to

express my own thoughts and ideas in greater depth than a Tweet.




This is also a moment when the quality of discourse in our national civic life has

deteriorated and when polarized views and divisiveness are pervasive. We take a great

risk in emulating this tone, or allowing it to seep into how we communicate with each

other, as we grapple with the challenges facing Palo Alto in the coming year.




One of the great moral voices of our time, Jonathan Sacks, has written:

“When the winds blow hardest, it is then that you need strong roots.”
