from the Consent Calendar at the request of staff.

Council Member Freeman registered a “no” vote on Item No. 10.

Council Member Council Member Lytle registered “no” votes on Item Nos. 9,

Mayor Mossar suggested Council Members register their “no” votes and
explain their votes during Council Comments.

Council Member Lytle asked Mayor Mossar for clarification of her directive.

Mayor Mossar explained Council had not been adhering to guidelines
regarding the Consent Calendar. She suggested the best way to handle the
Consent Calendar would be to register “no” votes and offer an explanation
during Council Comments.

Council Member Lytle said, given that explanation, she asked that Item Nos.
9, 10, and 11 be removed.

Mayor Mossar asked Assistant City Manager Harrison whether items 9 and
11 were time sensitive.
