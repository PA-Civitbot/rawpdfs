Mr. Williams said staff time was the only thing that was budgeted. The plan
was to take half of a Plannerâ€™s time to focus working on the Comp Plan and
the $240,000 was for consultant costs.

Council Member Klein said he was uncomfortable with the process and would
not support the Motion.

Council Member Shepherd said she wanted to see the project moved forward
and supported the Motion.

Council Member Price said she saw the importance of moving the project
forward and supported the Motion.

Council Member Holman supported the Motion.

MOTION FAILED:       3-3   Burt, Klein, Scharff no, Espinosa, Schmid, Yeh
absent

MOTION: Council Member Scharff moved, seconded by Council Member
Klein to have Staff modify 4-5 key components of the South El Camino Real
Design Guidelines (setbacks for different streets, land uses, height step
backs, break-up building length, and retail frontage) and authorize Staff to
spend $25k-$30k for a design consultant.

Council Member Holman asked whether the design concept would be
completed within a year.

Mr. Williams confirmed it would take a year.

Council Member Holman asked if it was feasible to implement one change in
the near-term of changing the sidewalk from 12 feet to 18 feet and to
address the remaining portion of the package within the year.

Mr. Williams said he was not in favor of that approach because the issue
could involve lengthy discussions. Additionally, he felt the Planning &
Transportation Commission would want to look at all parameters to see how
they worked together.

MOTION PASSED: 6-0 Espinosa, Schmid, Yeh absent

MOTION: Council Member Holman moved, seconded by Council Member
Klein for Staff to include the evaluation of area concept plans under LEED-
ND principles.
