Mayor Burt: I think it's okay. The main thrust is to get the concept for a
deep consideration at Policy and Services. I think it does that.

Council Member Holman: As long as that's clear, I'm good with that.

Mayor Burt: I think at this hour we want to be moving things forward. We
have another item on our agenda.

Council Member DuBois: (inaudible) real quick.

Mayor Burt: Council Member DuBois.

Council Member DuBois: I think originally you were trying to capture what
was in the report. This is for Fiscal Year '18, to refer it to Staff not to Policy
and Services. Item 4 would go to Policy and Services. Does that make it
clear? Instead of referring both of them to Policy and Services.

Council Member Holman: The fourth bullet is to Policy and Services in the
Staff Report.

Council Member DuBois: I'm talking about the second one.

Council Member Holman: You're talking about the second bullet only?

Council Member DuBois: I think the confusion was that maybe that should
just be referred to Staff as part of the Fiscal Year '18.

Vice Mayor Scharff: That's (inaudible) your motion.

Council Member DuBois: I thought that's the Motion you originally made.

Council Member Holman: No. I originally made the Motion to send it to
P&S, because I think it has more gravity if it goes to P&S with a referral.

Mayor Burt: The Motion is to refer it to P&S.

Vice Mayor Scharff: I have accepted that. I don't know if ...

Council Member Holman: Thank you.

Council Member Wolbach: I'll accept it too.
