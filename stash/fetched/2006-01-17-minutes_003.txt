the minutes of November 21, December 5 and 12, 2005.

MOTION PASSED 8-0, Barton abstaining.

City Attorney Gary Baum said Council Minutes were informal under Robert’s
Rules and Parliamentary Procedures, but standards were higher on Consent
items. Council Members could participate in second readings and items
brought before Council as long as they were comfortable and familiar with
the matter. Under State Law, Council Members were compelled to vote but
could abstain if they had legal conflicts or were unfamiliar with the matter.

Mayor Kleinberg said Council Members would be given two minutes to
explain their “no” votes after all votes were taken on Consent items.
