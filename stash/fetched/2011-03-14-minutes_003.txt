Mayor Espinosa asked Mr. Perez to explain Staff’s reaction to the 10 percent
infrastructure backlog.

Mr. Perez said he was working with the Public Works Department and the
Infrastructure Blue Ribbon Commission (IBRC) to update the numbers and
define the backlog in operational and capital maintenance. The dollar figure
was driven from the Kitchell Report which indicated that $160 million should
be spent. The first 5-year budget was $60 million. He said a review would
be made in getting closer to the $150 million mark.

Council Member Holman asked why changes No. 5 and 6 were not
incorporated into the Base Model scenario.

Council Member Schmid said he did not include No. 5 which was the $10
million per year because of IBRC’s work and being sensitive to the fact that
it was treated as a policy decision separate from the operating cost.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to include all units with 3-year salary freeze (one-
year deferral of PD increase).

Council Member Scharff said the $10 million for backlog should be a
placeholder and was necessary to help the IBRC know what was needed to
fund the infrastructure.

AMENDMENT: Council Member Scharff moved, seconded by Council
Member XXXX to include in the FY 2012-2014 a placeholder of $10 million
for the infrastructure backlog.

AMENDMENT FAILED DUE TO LACK OF SECOND

Council Member Burt did not accept the Amendment because the Finance
Committee had came forward with a step increase. He said there would be a
$10 million step increase in a year whether the increase was in FY2012 or
FY2013.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to direct the Finance Committee to return with a
strategic plan to build in maintenance of the infrastructure backlog at its
current level through ongoing revenues.
