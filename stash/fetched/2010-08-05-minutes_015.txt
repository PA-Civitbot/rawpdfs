considered in the High Speed Rail Authority’s Draft Environmental Impact
Report.

Council Member Holman said her reason for the Motion was because there
was a need for the City to be heard loud and clear that the tunneling option
was the preferred alternative and should be considered in the Authority’s
DEIR.

Mayor Burt asked Council Member Holman if she was referring to the deep
tunneling and not a Cut and Cover trench.

Council Member Holman said that was correct.

Council Member Shepherd asked to accept Cut and Cover and not remove
the deep tunnel option. Deep tunneling was only for the HSR which would
tunnel the train through the community and Caltrain would remain at grade.
She said when the community reviewed the alternatives it was determined
that the Cut and Cover option satisfied all three train systems below grade.

INCORPORATED INTO MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE MAKER
AND SECONDER to include Cut and Cover as a preferred alternative.

Council Member Schmid needed clarification on the Cut and Cover and
trenching options.

Mayor Burt said the Cut and Cover was a covered trench.

Council Member Schmid asked if it was included in the trench.

Mayor Burt said there was a difference between Open Trench and Cut and
Cover which was a covered trench.

Council Member Schmid said he needed clarification on a 2-track system
through Palo Alto.

Mayor Burt said it was a system the Authority was looking at to determine
perspective ridership and route connections where a 4-track system was not
required. There was the possibility of a combination between Caltrain and
HSR of a peak volume of 10 trains per hour per direction that would allow an
operation to accommodate the volume by having different areas of the
Peninsula with 2-track and 4-track sections.
