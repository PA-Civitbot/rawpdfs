                                        individual appellant be given less than five minutes for
                                        presentation and three minutes for rebuttal. In the event a
                                        request is made and the need for additional time is clearly
                                        established, the presiding officer shall independently, or may
                                        upon advice of the city attorney, grant sufficient additional
                                        time to allow an adequate presentation by the applicant or
                                        appellant in a hearing required by law.

                                        3) Addressing the Council after a Motion. Following the
                                        time for public input and once the matter is returned to the
                                        Council no person shall address the Council without first
                                        securing the permission of the Council so to do, subject to
                                        approval of the City Attorney with respect to any hearing




                                                                                                                       Attachment: 2.15.11 (1422 : Policy and Services Agenda 2/15/2011)
                                        required by law.

                              c) Decorum. The Palo Alto Municipal Code makes it unlawful
                              for any person to:

                                        1) Disrupt the conduct of a meeting;

                                        2) Make threats against any person or against public order
                                        and security while in the Council chamber.

                                        3) Use the Council Chambers during meetings for any
                                        purpose other than participation in or observation of City
                                        Council Meetings.

             Any Council Member may appeal the presiding officer’s decision on a
decorum violation to the full Council. Decorum violations are punishable as a
misdemeanor and may lead to a person being removed from the Council meeting.ii
