assumptions even if it would not be their recommendation. For example, on
the rolling amortization Council should be clear that they would not pay off
the unfunded liability. Bartel and Associates may put a caveat in the report
clarifying the amortization period was in name only and the City really was
not paying its unfunded liability off. Second were those items with a major
caveat. Those were assumptions that Bartel and Associates would not
consider to be within the range of acceptable practice. They would include a
caveat to the effect of “the assumption was selected by the City, but Bartel
Associates believes the assumption was not appropriate.” He said that they
split the eight assumptions into two groups. He also stated that for context
they were looking at an 2011-12 Actuarial Required Contribution (ARC) of
$13,478,000 a $3.7 million increase, $2.7 of which was General Fund, and
then the 2012-13 Annual Required Contribution (ARC), again prior to the
changes, $14.242 million, an extra $700,000. The first category had four
items. The first was the amortization method indicated on Agenda Packet
Page 449. The amortization method impacted the 2011-12 current fiscal
year by reducing the annual required contribution by $300,000. Item No. 2,
the asset smoothing, went to a market value rather than a smooth method
also reducing the contribution by about $300,000. Item No. 3, the actuarial
load, was included because they believed California Public Employees
Retirement (CalPERS) premiums had not risen consistent with claims. On
Item No. 4, he explained the discount rate increased from their
recommended 7.25 to the maximum discount rate, or that the maximum
investment return assumption that CalPERS would allow would decrease the
ARC by about a half a million dollars. He showed the respective amounts for
the next 4 items, the medical trend, CalPERS experience study, medical plan
at retirement, and the Medicare eligibility. Slide 6’s header was “Possible
Discount Rates.” He thought that the language should be different. Council
had the option to choose from one of three investment scenarios by
CalPERS. Those were the maximum discount rates for each of the three
options. Bartel and Associates believed that Council had selected Option No.
1, which had a maximum discount rate of 7.61. They recommended a
discount rate below that at 7.25.

Mr. Perez said the possible discount rates were 7.61, 7.06, or 6.39 percent.
If Council chose any of those options, the highest they could go in the rate
of return assumption was 7.61 percent.          Suggested changes in the
methodology had a City wide impact of a reduction in the ARC annual
required contribution of $900,000. Of that, about $600,000 was the General
Fund cost avoidance with the recommendation. In fiscal year 2011-12, they
were allowed to continue using 7.75 percent. There were no options. The
rates he gave started with fiscal year 2012-13. For 2011-12 there was no
impact. He disclosed that since the February 2012 Finance Committee
meeting CalPERS had made a change on the pension side so there were two
