Mr. Emslie said they would, provided they could meet all the requirements.

Council Member Kishimoto said she did not know how the subdivision could

Council Member Cordell asked if the motion went forward, would the Council

Mayor Beecham clarified the motion on the floor was to approve the

Council Member Cordell said the map included five parcels. The Council did
not know how many homes would be built on the five parcels.

Mayor Beecham said there would be one home per parcel. It was yet to be
decided whether there would be second homes allowed, per State

Council Member Cordell said there were potentially five homes.

Council Member Morton said the Council would approve five smaller houses,
opposed to three larger houses.

Mr. Emslie said the floor area was appropriate to the lot size.

Council Member Kleinberg said she had concerns about the density. Five
houses had concerned the more contiguous neighbors. She felt there would
be a congestion problem. Three lots invited larger homes plus second units.

Council Member Ojakian said it was important to determine how the project
