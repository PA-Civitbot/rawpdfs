City Manager Frank Benest said staff would return with more information,
and the Council would have another opportunity to make changes.

Council Member Morton said before an election, the City should be clear to
identify what was considered information. The information should not be
considered advocacy because it was positive.

AMENDMENT WITHDRAWN BY MAKER AND SECONDER

Mr. Baum said he would provide a memorandum to the Council and to staff.
There was a distinction between advocacy and providing information. There
were no prohibitions to providing information via the City and the City
Council. As individuals, a Council Member could, with their own campaign
committee, be for or against.

Assistant City Manager Emily Harrison said in order to have an election in
February or March, the Committee would need a solid proposal in a timely
manner.

Council Member Morton said he would decline adding to the fee.

AMENDMENT: Council Member Morton moved, seconded by Freeman, to
consider a second measure to request additional monies for gutters and
curbs.

Council Member Freeman asked whether there was a cost difference to have
one item versus two items on the ballot.

Ms. Harrison said she did not believe there would be a cost difference.

Council Member Mossar said storm drains meant property, transportation,
and natural resource protection. Upgrades were needed for clean water, the
bay, and creeks.

Mayor Beecham said his goal was to invest in infrastructure. The current
proposal had a defined timeframe, projects, and contribution. He felt, as
individuals, the Council Members needed to campaign for storm drains and
to explain the necessity for them.

Council Member Cordell said it was still unknown what residentsâ€™ thoughts
were on the subject. She queried whether the timeframe to adjust the
proposal was until December.

Ms. Harrison confirmed.
