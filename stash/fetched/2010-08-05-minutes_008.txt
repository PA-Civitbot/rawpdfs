City Manager to execute Amendment No. Two (Attachment C) to contract
C10131631 with Turner Construction, Inc., to add up to $3,008,250. This          Deleted: in the amount of

amount includes $2,737,500 for basic services and $270,750 for additional
services for a total contract amount not to exceed $3,578,448. Approval of
Amendment No. Two includes the following additional workscope:

         a. Construction management services for the Mitchell Park Library
            and Community Center (PE-09006), in the amount of
            $2,600,000 for basic services and $260,000 for additional
            services.

         b. Project administration services for the remodel and expansion of
            the Main Library (PE-11000), in the amount of $92,500 for basic
            services and $10,750 for additional services.

Mr. Roberts said the funds were necessary to allow Staff to proceed in
investigating options for a temporary facility. He asked if there was a way to
satisfy the Councilâ€™s concern without deleting the $15,000.

Council Member Scharff asked Staff if the design service was required. He
said he was still unclear why the money was being requested at this time
and preferred having Staff come back to the Council on September 13, 2010
with a plan for the $15,000.

Ms. Jennings said all of the information regarding facility size and its usage
would be given to an architect to determine and evaluate the feasibility of a
potential temporary site. Square footage, reconfiguration, cost or whether
to lease portables would be taken into consideration. The evaluation would
help in making a decision on whether to operate a temporary site at that
location and the resources necessary to pay for the evaluation service.

Council Member Scharff needed clarification on how the $75,000 was going
to be utilized.

Mr. Roberts said the entire $75,000 was not for a preliminary study and a
recommendation. It was to allow Staff to get through the design activities
for Mitchell and to proceed with the design for Main.

Council Member Scharff asked if there was any reason why this could not
come back to the Council with a plan in September 2010. He said he agreed
that if the City could save money and it made sense with library operations,
then Staff should move forward with it.
