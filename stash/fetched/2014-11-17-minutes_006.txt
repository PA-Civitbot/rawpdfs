Council Member Price inquired about the feasibility and cost of implementing
a mixed flow option and then moving toward a dedicated lane option.

Mr. Ristow indicated the cost would include removal of the outside bulb-outs
and construction of the interior median busway. Moving from a mixed flow
option to a dedicated lane option was possible; however, funds would be
expended twice for the same type of project.

Council Member Scharff asked if dedicated lanes would extend beyond
Embarcadero Road.

Mr. Ristow replied no.

Council Member Scharff understood VTA had agreed not to extend dedicated
lanes into Palo Alto.

Mr. Ristow advised that the City of Mountain View requested VTA study
dedicated lanes further into Mountain View and into Palo Alto; therefore, VTA
added the alternative.

Council Member Scharff inquired about the real impact of BRT on traffic in
Palo Alto.

Mr. Rodriguez reported initial analysis indicated significant impacts to vehicle
traffic at intersections crossing Alma Street.

Council Member Scharff believed extending BRT to Palo Alto would not be
beneficial.

Mr. Ristow indicated VTA could do nothing or one of the two options.
Ridership and effectiveness of a bus in a dedicated lane was important.

Council Member Scharff stated the presentation did not demonstrate the
impacts of dedicated lanes to the various locations.

Mr. Ristow explained that he summarized much of the material in the
interest of time.

Council Member Scharff remarked that VTA had not provided the City with
adequate time or information to review the impacts of dedicated lanes
through Palo Alto.

Mr. Ristow reported VTA staff would provide clarification and answer City
Staff questions regarding specific details. Information regarding level of
service, traffic delay, and traffic impact and diversion was contained in the
EIR.
