Council Member Questions, Comments and Announcements

Mayor Scharff: Now, my favorite part which is Council Member Comments,
Questions and Announcements. Council Member Holman.

Council Member Holman: I have a question please. We have a second
Retreat that is scheduled. At least some of us don't know the purpose of
that Retreat. We've had a consultant reach out to us wanting to have
conversations. I don't know how to prep for that conversation because I
don't know what the Retreat is for or about. Can we be enlightened on that
please?

Mayor Scharff: I think that's a good question. I think I'll have the Acting
City Manager, Ed Shikada, send out an email to all of Council regarding the
Retreat, so we can do it in a thoughtful and obviously get questions back
from Council Members. Seeing no other lights—I want to make sure—the
meeting's adjourned.

Adjournment: The meeting was adjourned at 11:24 P.M.
