moved by Kniss and seconded by Council Member Scharff to designate the

delegate and Council Member Kniss as alternate voting delegate—if the City
Clerk can correct that—for the National League of Cities Annual Business

Council Member Questions, Comments and Announcements

Mayor Holman: With that then, do we have any Council Member Comments,
Questions, Announcements? Council Member DuBois.

Council Member DuBois: I just wanted to say on Make a Difference Day I
worked on the duck pond. Some really great kids and some adults. I think
the Kiwanis Club has been doing this for ten years or more. A lot of great
work. I just want to say to Council Members, if you want to clean up some
crap in Palo Alto, the duck pond is a great place to do it.
