G.      The Traffic Demand Management (TDM) program will reduce motor
        vehicle trips by 20 percent during A.M. and P.M. peak hours.

Mayor Burt:       Let's first vote on what's listed here as "A," which is
certification of the Final EIR. That is approved on a 5-3 vote with Council
Members Schmid, Filseth and Holman voting no and DuBois recused. Now
let's vote on the balance of the motion, Sections B-G, on the board. That
passes on a 7-1 vote with Council Member Holman opposing and Council
Member DuBois recused. I think that concludes the item.
