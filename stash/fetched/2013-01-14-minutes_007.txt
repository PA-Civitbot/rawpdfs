CITY MANAGER COMMENTS

James Keene, City Manager reported a community meeting was held
January 8, 2013 regarding the Newell Road Bridge Project. More information
was available on the City's website. The Martin Luther King Jr. Holiday was
January 21, 2013, and the City would co-sponsor the third annual Day of
Service from 11:00 A.M. to 3:00 P.M. at Lytton Plaza. A large coast live oak
fell in Rinconada Park, and Public Works crews removed the tree. Because
root rot caused the tree to fall, inspections were scheduled for other large
oaks in the park. The City and Acterra thanked and honored Super Stream
Keeper James McCarthy for his advocacy of protection of Lower Adobe Creek
in Palo Alto.    Palo Alto Firefighters raised $12,000 for Breast Cancer
Connections.
