INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to add to the terms of the PC Ordinance that
there will only be six months of non-penalty every five years.

Mayor Shepherd inquired whether the Applicant would accept the additional
provision.

Mr. Spiers requested clarification of the provision. He asked if a subsequent
tenant would need to sign a minimum five-year lease.

Council Member Schmid explained that if one grocery tenant went out of
business, the Applicant would have six months to replace the tenant. A
penalty would not be imposed during that six-month period. The City would
provide only one-six-month period every five years free of penalty. He
wanted to ensure the Applicant was confident a subsequent tenant would be
successful.

Mr. Spiers inquired whether Council Member Schmid was suggesting the
Applicant utilize the full six months to select another tenant.

Council Member Schmid indicated the Applicant could utilize two, three, or
six months.

Mr. Spiers reiterated that the store could be vacant without a penalty only
six months in one five-year period. That sounded reasonable; however, he
hesitated to add more safeguards to the ones already in place.

Mr. Fox inquired whether the Applicant could utilize three months to find a
second tenant and, should the second tenant fail, another three months to
find a third tenant.

Council Member Schmid replied yes.

Mr. Spiers accepted the provision.

Council Member Berman found no provision for the use of penalty funds,
should any be collected. He asked if Staff considered whether penalty funds
could benefit the College Terrace area.

Ms. Gitelman assumed penalty funds would be used for Code enforcement
efforts. The Council could make that decision.

Council Member Berman asked how funds would be utilized for Code
enforcement.
