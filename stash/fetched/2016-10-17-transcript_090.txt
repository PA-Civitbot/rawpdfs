Council Member Holman: I guess that's a question for the Vice Mayor? I
want to protect the retail that exists also in SOFA II, but what is your ...

Vice Mayor Scharff: I'm happy ...

Council Member Holman: What was the original Motion?

Vice Mayor Scharff: The original Motion was the entire framework including
the SOFA stuff that's on there, but I think we should clarify that let's protect
the existing retail in all of SOFA.

Council Member Holman: Say it again.

Vice Mayor Scharff: Let's protect the existing retail in all of SOFA.

Council Member Holman: That clarifies that.

Vice Mayor Scharff: Liz, are you fine with that? That means we shouldn't
just say the Downtown Business District. We should say and SOFA.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to add to the end of the Motion Part B, “and SOFA
II.

Council Member Kniss: Just to clarify, there isn't a lot of retail in SOFA that
I’m seeing on this to protect.

Council Member Holman: There's quite a bit.          If you go around there,
there's quite a bit on the streets, quite frankly.

Council Member Kniss: It just doesn't show then.

Council Member Holman: They don't show what's in existing. Going back to
the CUP, I think we can just leave that out for now.

Mayor Burt: For me, if the Motion now includes all retail including in SOFA,
then I would want to allow certain uses under a conditional use.

Council Member DuBois: Which is in the framework.

Mayor Burt: Where is it?

Council Member DuBois: I think Council Member Scharff is including this
entire framework, which includes allowing private schools in RT-35.

Mayor Burt: 4B, is that what you're referring to?
