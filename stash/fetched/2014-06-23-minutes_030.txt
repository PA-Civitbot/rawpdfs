Council Member Burt felt that the applicant heard Council’s inclination to
approve the Category Two designation. The applicant qualified for TDR’s,
with the reclassification, but Council may want to revise the TDR’s in the
future.

Council Member Holman wondered if the application would go back to the
HRB if it were continued.

Ms. Silver answered that the project would return to the HRB.

Council Member Holman remarked that basements served as support space
for retail and if the basements continued to be converted, the retail would be
diminished. She requested that Staff bring forward clarification on “building
envelope” and “Grandfathering”.

Ms. Stump noted that the interpretation of building envelope applied to
projects going forward.

Council Member Holman differentiated between Council’s interpretation and
the Municipal Code definition.

Ms. Stump explained that the Council’s meaning served as the interpretation
of “building envelope” and did not require a Municipal Code amendment.

Council Member Holman wanted to ensure that this term was interpreted for
future reference.

Ms. Stump clarified this was an interpretation of the law and suggested
clarifying language.

Council Member Holman agreed and suggested the same with the term
“Grandfathering” so these terms were not open to interpretation. This was a
reasonable mode of explanation and a fair test for the applicant, the public,
and Staff; it helped people to feel like they were being treated fairly.
