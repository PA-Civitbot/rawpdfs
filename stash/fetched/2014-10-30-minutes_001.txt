AGENDA ITEMS

1.     Discussion of Recruitment for City Clerk.

Kathy Shen, Chief People Officer; People, Strategy and Operations,
articulated Staff had sent out Requests for Proposals (RFP) to four
recruitment firms and received responses from three; Bob Murray &
Associates, Peckham & McKenney and Ralph Andersen & Associates. All
three firms had participated in City recruitments in the prior five years. Staff
recommended using Peckham & McKenney because their firm had conducted
numerous City Clerk recruitments.

Vice Mayor Kniss asked what the differentiators were between the firms.

Ms. Shen stated while the differentiators were subjective, all three firms
were qualified for the specified recruitment.

Vice Mayor Kniss felt Ralph Andersen & Associates provided positive service
with the recruitment of the Planning and Community Environment Director.

Ms. Shen agreed with the assessment and recalled Ralph Andersen &
Associates was currently performing the recruitment for the Community
Services Director.
