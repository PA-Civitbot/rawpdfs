Chief Planning Official Lisa Grote replied offices could be built on it and that
was the approximate range.

Council Member Ojakian said the original project heard by Council was for a
74,000-square-foot building, and it was suggested the site could take
24,000 square feet.

Ms. Grote said that was correct.

Council Member Ojakian asked what other types of businesses could be built
other than a restaurant and did the present building have to remain on the
site.

Ms. Grote replied a restaurant was the only type of business allowed under
the PC zone.

Council Member Ojakian asked whether it was solely restricted to restaurant
use.

Ms. Grote replied that was correct.

Council Member Ojakian asked whether the present building could be
demolished.

Ms. Grote replied the PC could be abandoned.

Council Member Ojakian asked what would be allowed on the property if the
present building were demolished.

Ms. Grote said it could only be used for what was allowed in the PC or the PC
could be amended. The land use was very restrictive.

the  staff and     Planning and Transportation  Commission     (PTC)
