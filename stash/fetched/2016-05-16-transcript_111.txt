Ms. Gitelman: We already think the 8,000 and change that we included in
these options is pretty aggressive in terms of reducing the rate of job
growth. Remember jobs are in existing building space as well as new
building space.

Council Member Schmid:     I was using the monitored six areas of the City
from 2000 to 2015.

Mayor Burt:    This is all areas, monitored and non-monitored.        You're
comparing the rate in the monitored areas to what we would do in all areas.

Council Member Schmid: The number for just the monitored areas came to
around 50, and I am suggesting this ...

Mayor Burt: This job growth in the monitored areas ...

Council Member Schmid:     ... is 65.   It's well above the monitored growth
rate.

Mayor Burt: Within this proposal, in just the monitored areas, how much job
growth do we have?

Council Member Schmid: About 50 per year.

Mayor Burt: In "A" here? In the monitored areas.

Council Member Schmid: That's what the historical growth has been.

Mayor Burt: That's not what I'm asking. In this proposal ...

Council Member Schmid: This proposal ...

Mayor Burt: Just a sec. We have 2.7 million square feet total.

Council Member Schmid:       Of which 1.3 is standard, which is already
approved.

Mayor Burt: Just a second. What portion of that is in the monitored area
out of the 2.7?

Council Member Schmid: Except for the Stanford, I assume it's a substantial
(crosstalk).

Mayor Burt: Stanford's not in the monitored area.

Council Member Schmid: No, the Stanford Medical.
