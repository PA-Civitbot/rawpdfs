Council Member Kleinberg encouraged a follow-up on the individual who
spoke regarding the allegations of toxic waste being dumped.

Mayor Kishimoto noted that two weeks ago she was invited by the United
Kingdom to make a trip to London, South Hampton and working with Mayors
from Sacramento, Berkeley, Seattle, and Tucson. She noted in England
there was a lot of discussion about Combined Heat and Power (CHP) as it
was economically viable. One cityâ€™s approach was to provide high energy
efficiency of 80 percent sustainable energy, as opposed to 20 percent
renewable energy.

Council Member Beecham reported his attendance at the annual Northern
California Power Agency (NCPA); the preeminent energy meeting on the
West Coast. The focus of the meeting was on global warming. The NCPA
would be meeting with staff from Sacramento next week to help them work
on options on a financial basis. Decisions on how allocations of emissions are
made for CO2 from the electric industry needed to be made.


ADJOURNMENT: The meeting adjourned at 8:32 p.m.
