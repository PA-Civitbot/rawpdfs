Ms. Gitelman advised that the explanatory text below Finding 5, on packet
page 271, regarding protection of "nesting common birds" should state
"conditions to protect onsite trees."

Council Member Holman inquired whether she could ask about a topic other
than the subdivision.

Ms. Stump reported the subdivision was the topic agendized.        Incidental,
closely related, and brief inquiries were acceptable.

Council Member Holman asked if all exterior building and landscape
improvements, as stated on packet page 274, would be retained or kept in
good repair.

Ms. Gitelman indicated the intent was for improvements to be maintained in
good order for the life of the project.

MOTION: Council Member Holman moved, seconded by Vice Mayor Kniss
to accept the Planning and Transportation Commission recommendation and
approve the tentative map based on the Record of Land Use Action and
allowing the six approved units to be sold as condominiums rather than
rented.

Council Member Schmid noted the item had been included in the Housing
Elements for 2007-2014 and 2015-2023. He inquired whether Council
approval of the item would result in the loss of six units from the 2015-2023
Housing Element.

Ms. Gitelman reported the units would remain in the new Housing Element,
because they would be approved in the 2014 calendar year.

Council Member Schmid asked how Staff calculated the 0.9 unit for the in-
lieu housing fee mentioned on packet page 273.

Russ Reich, Senior Planner, explained that 0.9 was 15 percent of the six
dwelling units. Because it did not equal one dwelling unit, the applicant
would pay the fractional amount.
