model, and then the Council would consider them. The FY 2013 Proposed
Budget included a one-time savings of $2.7 million. This resulted from
freezing 15 Public Safety positions, 6 in the Fire Department and 7 in the
Police Department.        The Proposed Budget also included one-time
expenditures of $1.6 million for technology, election costs, and a loan to the
Airport Fund. The net one-time savings were approximately $1 million.
Outsourcing Animal Services was also included in the Proposed Budget. The
$600,000 in net annual savings assumed the exodus of Mountain View from
the partnership and outsourcing services. If the City did not outsource
Animals Services and maintained the facility, then the impact on the General
Fund would be $1.1 million. The FY 2013 Proposed Budget included a net
savings of $116,000 from the Library. Five positions in Library would be
frozen as a result of the remodeling in the Library System. Staff expected to
break even in FY 2014, and an estimated net cost increase of approximately
$1 million beginning in FY 2015. Over the next ten years, the average
increase in net revenues was $2.8 million and the increase in expenditures
was $3.4 million, resulting in a structural deficit. FY 2012 revenues had
exceeded FY 2008 revenues; however, FY 2012 expenditures had also
exceeded FY 2008 expenditures. The FC requested the inclusion of $2.2
million per year for infrastructure keep-up. Tax receipts, approximately 50
percent of the Budget, were less than the expenses for salary and benefits.
Medical costs were increasing by 10 percent.            The California Public
Employees Retirement System (CalPERS) had decreased its rate of return
assumption for the pension portfolio. Concessions from the Fire Fighter and
the Fire Chief Associations were approximately $1.6 million, and
approximately $1.5 million from the Police Officers Association. Staff had
included a 2 percent cost of living increase for miscellaneous or non-Public
Safety employees beginning in FY 2014 and going forward. Since 2000,
General Fund Full-Time Equivalents (FTE) had decreased by approximately
18 percent; however, salary and benefits had increased by 50 percent.
Since 2002, pension expense had increased six fold. The retiree medical
annual contribution had grown by $2 million in the General Fund. In the
Citywide pension trend, FY 2016 and 2017 included the direction of 3
percent growth per year. Staff included the 10 percent cost increase
assumption for healthcare. Staff had not included the Infrastructure Blue
Ribbon Commission (IBRC) recommendations of $4.2 million per year over
ten years for catch-up and $210 million for new construction of facilities.
Staff had not included revenues from new hotels at the FC's direction. The
FC also asked Staff to include only negotiated concessions from employee
groups. There were no assumptions for a revenue initiative related to
infrastructure. One alternative scenario assumed the frozen positions in
Public Safety became permanent reductions, which would reduce expense by
40 percent. A second scenario suggested changing the 3 percent rate of
return for CalPERS to 1.5 percent for those years without a CalPERS
