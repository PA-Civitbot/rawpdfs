Council Member Schmid asked if Staff had an idea of how many change
orders the major activities would bring.


Mr. Bobel said there were a substantial number of new change orders
forthcoming.


Council Member Schmid echoed Council Member Klein’s comments that the
operation was still below the estimated budget even with the onset of
change orders. He reiterated that the Council was dedicated to insure the
process was well-run.


Council Member Scharff asked that the next report be written broadly as
possible to allow the Council to take action, to make changes, or to give
policy directives.   A statement such as “please accept the report” was too
limiting.   He noted that the color chart had two different figures for the
project and needed clarification.


Mr. Bobel said the $32 million was for construction and the larger figure was
for design and other features such as permitting.


Council Member Scharff asked if the $32 million was still in line of the
budget.


Mr. Sartor said yes.     The City’s total project cost was awarded at $41
million, which included design, construction management, signage, and
other contracts associated with equipment and materials and still on track of
the awarded cost.
