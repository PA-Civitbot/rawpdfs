Council Member Morton inquired whether the neighborhood was being asked
to change its position.

Mayor Kishimoto responded she did not know if the neighborhood would
change its mind but this would give them notice so they could come and
speak before Council.

Council Member Cordell inquired if the only way Council can vote “no” on
this is if there is some factual basis.

Mr. Baum replied he did not have the subdivision map act findings in front of
him but there have to be specific findings that the Final Map did not match
the conditions of the Tentative Map in the project approval.

Council Member Cordell asked if Council has the Final Map.

Mr. Baum replied that is correct.

Council Member Cordell noted the indication is that the Final Map matches
the Tentative Map.

Mr. Baum said yes and it must also match the conditions of approval.

Council Member Cordell asked if the conditions of approval are met and the
Final Map matches the Tentative Map, there seems to be no legal way other
than to approve the map.

Mr. Baum replied that is correct.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION: Council Member Beecham moved, seconded by
Mossar, to approve staff and the Planning and Transportation Commission
(PTC) recommendation to approve the proposed Final Map to create two
single family residential parcels and a remainder lot.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION PASSED: 7-2, Drekmeier, Kishimoto no.
