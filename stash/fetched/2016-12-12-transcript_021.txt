Malcolm Beasley, regarding Agenda Item Number 5: Thank you, Council.
I'd like to express appreciation for Mayor Burt's wonderful summary of his
time and all the things you've done over the last few years. My only word to
him and Council Member Schmid who are stepping down is I hope you're
more successful in retirement than I have been. Hence, I'm here. I would
urge removal of Item 5 from the Consent Calendar. This relates to the Lot D
at Hamilton and Waverley, as I'm sure you know. I appreciate that this
would be one more delay in addressing this issue or its progress or lack
thereof. This project is part, as we all know, of a larger set of issues, really
the triangle of housing, parking and traffic. As I've thought about these
issues and been active, as some of you know, over the last few years, I've
come to the feeling and opinion that each action that relates to this triangle
really needs to be considered explicitly and publicly by Council in the triangle
with all the issues on the table at least in some sense. I think this public
consideration would lead to better decisions and to perhaps and hopefully
more civil discourse. I think that as part of this I've come to believe that our
collective failure to do this in these really thorny issues is frankly a weakness
