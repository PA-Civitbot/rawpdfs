Ms. Furth suggested, “The policies and programs for implementing this Goal
H-1 shall be implemented at locations identified in the Housing Sites
Inventory and to be identified in the upcoming Zoning Map and
Comprehensive Plan Land Use Map Amendments as part of the Zoning
Ordinance update.

AMENDMENT PASSED 9-0.

AMENDMENT: Council Member Lytle moved, seconded by Freeman, on
page 10, first bullet under New Development Standards and Zoning Districts,
to insert the language “The 50-foot height limit will continue to be respected
except through specific site applications and on an exception basis.”

Mr. Benest said staff was not throwing out all the development standards for
housing. Staff suggested flexibility in terms of height, FAR, and other
development standards for 100 percent affordable housing.

AMENDMENT FAILED 3-5, Freeman, Kishimoto, Lytle “yes,” Morton
absent.

AMENDMENT: Council Member Lytle moved, seconded by Freeman, to
insert language directing when there are changes in R-1 Districts, they are
to be done through overlay zones.

Council Member Lytle asked that the wording be placed universally.

Council Member Freeman suggested that the wording be placed in a
universal location rather than policy and program-by-program.

Vice Mayor Mossar would not support the motion, noting concern about not
adding density in residential neighborhoods.

Council Member Kishimoto said there were specific types of neighborhoods,
such as Eichler, which were less conducive to densification.

Ms. Furth said the Council had to decide on directives about considering zone
changes. The question was whether the Council wanted to establish a policy
at the current item that when zone changes were done, they were done
through overlay zones or whether the Council wanted to reserve the decision
for a later date.

AMENDMENT FAILED 3-6, Freeman, Kishimoto, Lytle, “yes.”
