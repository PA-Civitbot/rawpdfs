Vice Mayor Scharff: Thank you.

Mayor Burt: Council Member Holman.

Council Member Holman: I apologize for this. I just pulled up the map
that's in our Packet on Page 303 of the RT-35 zone. Understand that this

Alma"? Just to make sure (crosstalk).

Mayor Burt: (crosstalk) addresses.

MAKER AND SECONDER to add to the Amendment, “or abutting” after
“(RT-35), on.”

AMENDMENT RESTATED:        Mayor Burt moved, seconded by Council
Member Berman to add to the Motion, “and allow education and medical
