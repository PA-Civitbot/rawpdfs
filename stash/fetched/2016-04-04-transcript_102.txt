                         TRANSCRIPT
Ms. Nose: As part of the yearend Memorandum that went forward, there's
1.3 million sitting in the Budget Stabilization Reserve for the General Fund.
It's just there pending further direction from the Council.

Mr. Keene: This is what I wanted to be clear. At this point, I haven't
reached a conclusion that we are going to proactively advance an additional
contribution to the 115 Fund as part of the original FY '17 Budget. That's
what I sort of heard from your question.

Mr. Burt: I hear you. I'm looking forward to continuing to make those
payments as painful as that may be. Let's see if we have a Motion to accept
the Forecast.

Council Member Kniss: So moved.

Council Member Berman: So moved.

MOTION: Council Member Kniss moved, seconded by Council Member
Berman to accept the Fiscal Year 2017 to 2026 General Fund Long Range
Financial Forecast.

Mayor Burt: Council Member Kniss, did you wish to speak to your Motion?

Council Member Kniss: No (inaudible).

Mayor Burt:    Council Member Berman, did you want to speak to your
second?

Council Member Berman: No, I'm good.

Mayor Burt:   Anyone else want to speak to the Motion?       Council Member
DuBois.

Council Member DuBois: If Chair Filseth wanted to addâ€”he proposed a
couple of things that I'd be willing to support. I didn't know if he was going
to make a Motion.

Council Member Filseth: I'm not sure they belong in this Motion. I'm not
sure they belong in this Motion. I think one of them had to do with the 2017
Operating Budget which is coming in a month. The other really had to do
with the Long Range Forecast for next year.

Mayor Burt: please vote on the board. That passes unanimously.

MOTION PASSED: 9-0
