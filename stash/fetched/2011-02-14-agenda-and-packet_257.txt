                                                                                                            10.d




 1   So with that I would like to make a motion. My motion is to recommend approval of the
 2   proposed Negative Declaration for California Avenue’s streetscape project, and to recommend a
 3   Capital Improvement Program to fund the project improvements.

                                                                                                                   Attachment: Attachment D: P&TC Excerpt Minutes of January 12, 2011 (1320 : California Avenue Neg Dec and CIP)
 5   SECOND
 6
 7   Commissioner Keller: Second.
 8
 9   Chair Tuma: Okay, so that is a motion by Vice-Chair Lippert, seconded by Commissioner
10   Keller. Mr. Lippert, would you like to speak to your motion?
11
12   Vice-Chair Lippert: Yes. First of all I would like to address Commissioner Fineberg’s concern
13   with regard to there not being a CIP element yet for this project. The CIP is forward looking and
14   this project isn’t going to be built until 2012. So really the upcoming CIP can incorporate and
15   can contain this project. Even though we are looking at in piecemeal and we are beginning this
16   process now those numbers will be incorporated in the upcoming CIP for 2011-2012 and 2012-
17   2013, correct?
18
19   Mr. Rodriguez: What we will actually recommend to the Council is a mid-year budget
20   adjustment to create a brand new project out of the infrastructure reserve so that we can fund the
21   project. It is actually a very important thing to do, because if we had to wait until the five-year
22   ________ process was complete or the mid-year process was completed we would actually not
23   be able to start design in the March timeframe as we would like to do today. We opted to take
24   the grant funding in February of 2012 versus this year because we wanted to not be constrained
25   by Caltrans guidelines for the acceptance of the funds through the design stage. So we purposely
26   fund the design now through the local match and asked for the construction funding later so that
27   we wouldn’t have to go through the local or disabled business enterprise process that
28   construction requires through the Caltrans document process. Although we do something like
29   that already on our own we didn’t want to be constrained by Caltrans. Does that make sense?
30
31   Vice-Chair Lippert: It does. So I think that moving forward with this is particularly important
32   especially since we have started putting in the trees, and those are going to begin to mature. This
33   is really the second phase of that.
34
35   The second comment I would like to make is with regard to a comment that my colleague,
36   Commissioner Martinez, made. There are adequate examples out there, I think probably Santa
37   Cruz Avenue in Menlo Park, you look at Castro Street in Mountain View, you look at University
38   Avenue in terms of the improvements that were done there. Those have greatly improved each
39   of those shopping districts tremendously. The most impressive I think right now is probably
40   Menlo Park which managed to get a whole bunch of merchants from Stanford Shopping Center
41   to move to Menlo Park. They are eating our lunch because they did their street improvements.
42   Well, we need to do something about that here in Palo Alto. One of the things that we can do is
43   to put in a series of street improvements along California Avenue.
44
45   Then the last point that I would like to make is with regard to California Avenue and the whole
46   issue of narrowing the road there. This is not an arterial. This is not like Middlefield Road.
