COUNCIL COMMENTS, QUESTIONS, AND ANNOUNCEMENTS

Council Member Cordell questioned whether the public could be given more
time for the ZOU public hearing noticed for March 14, 2005.

Council Member Morton concurred with Cordell’s request.

Assistant City Manager Emily Harrison stated she would check to see if the
CMR for the ZOU could be given out and posted on the web the next day.

Council Member Beecham questioned the contents of the staff report for the
ZOU and noted the public had the opportunity to review the process for the
ZOU.

Ms. Harrison said there were alternatives in a couple of places. The staff
report was not lengthy. The backup document was lengthy, but a large
portion was previously placed in the packets and had been discussed. There
were issues where staff presented alternatives that Council might want to
consider in solving issues the public had during the hearings.

Mayor Burch noted the City Manager and he had two coffees set up along
with a “call in” program at the Media Center and Coupa Café the next
evening from 7 to 8 p.m. for budget questions.
