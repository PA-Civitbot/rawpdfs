PUBLIC HEARINGS

2.   Public Hearing: Considering Revisions to the Transfer of Development
     Rights (TDR) Ordinance for City-Owned Properties, and Revisions to
     the Downtown CD Zone Ordinance to Increase Residential Density
     Limits. 1) Proposed Revisions to the Zoning Code, Chapters 18.87,
     18.49 and 18.32. The Proposed Zone Changes Would Allow Eligible
     City-Owned Historic Properties (Category 1 or Category 2) Located in
     Any Zone District to be “Sender Sites” Under the TDR Ordinance,
     Transferring Historic or Seismic Rehabilitation Floor Area Bonuses from
     these Sites to Eligible “Receiver” Sites Located in the Downtown CD
     Zone District; and Modify the Procedures and Requirements for
     Granting Floor Area Bonuses. Proposed Changes to Chapter 18.49
     also Would Modify Site Development Requirements, and Replace
     Maximum Residential Density Limit with a Required Maximum Average
     Unit Size, for Residential and Mixed-Use Projects Located in the CD
     Zone District to Encourage Use of TDR to Provide Housing Units. The
     Residential Density on a Mixed Use or Residential Site Would be
     Limited by the Floor Area Ratio (FAR), Site Development
     Requirements, Parking Requirements, and Comprehensive Plan
     Density Limits.    2) Provide Direction to Staff Regarding Possible
     Changes to Chapter 18.87.040 and 18.87.055 to Increase the
     Maximum Parking Exemption for Bonus Floor Area from 5,000 Square
     Feet to 10,000 Square Feet, and to Reduce the Required Distance
     Between TDR “Receiver” Sites and Residentially Zoned Property.
