Member XXXX that the Greenhouse Gas Value (“CO2 Adder”) come as a
separate column and not be included in the costs.

Mr. Keene voiced his concerns about the ability to single out factors in the
scenarios.

AMENDMENT WITHDRAWN BY THE MAKER

Council Member Holman said the Motion was to include additional exports of
non-Palo Alto site alternatives in which wet anaerobic alternatives would be
used in place of incineration. She asked whether that would combine sewage
sludge.

Mr. Bobel stated yes, sewage sludge and food scraps. He clarified that
alternative would address all three components; although the food and the
yard waste would be exported while the bio-solids were placed in a wet
anaerobic digestion at the Sewage Treatment Plant.

Council Member Scharff stated he supported the Motion although he had
reservations regarding the path.

Council Member Shepherd stated she supported the Motion.

Council Member Holman asked for clarification that Staff did not have
enough information at this time to discuss refuse rates.

Mr. Bobel stated there would not be ample time by June to translate the
options into refuse rates.

Council Member Holman asked if Staff would return with some of the
scenarios that were in Palo Alto Sustainability Study and the economic cost.

Mr. Bobel asked if the question was the cost to get a ton of greenhouse gas
reduction from one of the other techniques.

Council Member Holman stated that was correct and she believed the
information was available.

Mr. Bobel stated he believed the information was available and Staff was
working with the Utilities Department.

Vice Mayor Yeh clarified in the event the Ballot Measure did not pass, there
were two regional facilities which involved regional partners where this
analysis would be beneficial to them. He noted the work Staff was doing
