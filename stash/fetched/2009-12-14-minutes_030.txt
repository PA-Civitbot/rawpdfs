Council Member Burt inquired on an explanation for the reason of the
increase in fees, and why the City was out of funds with the Law Firm of
Duncan Weinberg, Genzer & Pembroke, P.C. (Law Firm of Duncan Weinberg)

City Attorney, Gary Baum stated the Law Firm of Duncan Weinberg had been
conducting services with the City for several years and there was an increase
in joint projects with neighboring utility cities and individual projects. Staff
had been utilizing the Law Firm of Duncan Weinberg with extensive work
representing the Cityâ€™s electric utility in federal and regional regulatory
proceedings before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC),
Western Electricity Coordinating Council, and other agencies. He stated the
bills had increased, and Staff determined the Law Firm of Duncan Weinberg
had an additional need to intervene in a series of FERC proceedings. He
provided justification on the increase to the existing agreement with the Law
Firm of Duncan Weinberg to ensure the City remain in compliance with State
laws and regulations.

MOTION:      Vice Mayor Morton moved, seconded by Council Member
Kishimoto to authorize the increase to an existing agreement with the law
firm of Duncan Weinberg Genzer & Pembrock, P.C. by an additional
$155,000 for a total contract not to exceed amount of $215,000.
