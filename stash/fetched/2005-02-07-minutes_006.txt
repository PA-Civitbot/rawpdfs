Council Member Morton asked whether the property that sold the rights had
first rights on the monies or did staff determine where it was used.

Mr. Emslie said, by Ordinance, it must be pledged to the particular site even

and not leave it open to 10,000 square feet at staff’s discretion.

Mr. Emslie said staff was not recommending an increase. Staff would ask

Council Member Morton asked what the dollar value was on an additional
5,000 square feet exception from parking.
