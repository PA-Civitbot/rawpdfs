focused more on the process of what to do rather than the importance of the
location. He asked whether the interim solution was necessary.

Larry Shapiro said he supported the airport as well as composting. The
issue was location. The airport community suggested placing the new
composting operations south of Palo Alto Airport, across the street from the
airport, behind the trees, eliminating the cost of moving Embarcadero Road
and the underground pipes and disrupting the view. All could be done in the
Cityâ€™s desired timeframe.
