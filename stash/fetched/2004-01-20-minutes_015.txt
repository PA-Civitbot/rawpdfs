Vice Mayor Burch asked if it would occur when the moratorium ended.

Mr. Emslie said the moratorium had ended and it would not take an action
by the Council.

Council Member Morton said he was concerned if the funding was not
received for the adaptive system, a lesser level of signal coordination would
be implemented.

Mr. Emslie said the plan was set up as proposed. If the trial status were
uncertain, recommendations from the staff would be made as to how long
the trial would trail the traffic adaptive.

Mayor Beecham said there was not money in the budget for the plan and the
City could not spend money unless the staff returned to the Council and
requested a Budget Amendment Ordinance (BAO).

Interim City Attorney Wynne Furth confirmed the resolution staff proposed
contained a phasing plan and a set of instructions.

Mayor Beecham asked if that was the resolution.

Ms. Furth replied yes. She said the plan was being adopted as a whole from
one end of the Corridor to the other.

Council Member Freeman asked if the dedicated right-hand turn lane into
Terman would be evaluated.

Mr. Kott said it would be evaluated.

Mayor Beecham directed staff to find funding. If four lanes to three would
not work, it would be changed. Established performance measures were
needed.
