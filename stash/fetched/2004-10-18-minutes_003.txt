unit. He also identified a number of different types of "hourly" employees,
including continuous hourlies, seasonal employees, PERS exempt staff, PERS
retirees, and intermittent hourly employees. Finally, the City Manager
presented the legal process the City must follow in considering the petition
to form the bargaining unit.
