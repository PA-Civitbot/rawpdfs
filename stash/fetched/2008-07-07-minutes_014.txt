      $50,000 for a One Year Term with Police Auditor (OIR Group) to
      Investigate Childrenâ€™s Theatre Police Investigation.

Vice Mayor Drekmeier stated his concern for the cost of the investigation, he
asked whether the detail being requested was the cause for the cost.

Michael Gennaco stated yes, a more simplified report would be more cost
effective.

Council Member Kishimoto asked for comments regarding the scope of the
questions being asked.

Mr. Gennaco stated without review of the questions he could not explain
whether they could be combined.

Council Member Kishimoto asked whether it seemed reasonable to lower the
proposed dollar amount and return with a request for more funding if it was
necessary.

Council halfway for a revisit of the investigation and funding status.
