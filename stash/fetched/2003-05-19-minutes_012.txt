prototypes, which was in a more graphic form. The density discussions were
sometimes about transitions, mass, and compatibility with the surroundings.

Council Member Lytle stated she believed staff was agreeing that density
maximums had not been set. The tables for 800 High Street were far below
what Council had approved.

Mr. Emslie agreed.

Council Member Lytle said the sooner the questions were answered
regarding density maximums, the less anxiety the community would have.
The community felt there was an absence of the limits that were normally
part of City planning.

Mr. Emslie said the missing pieces were the prototypes, and he believed they
were a very important part of the discussion. It was also an opportunity to
have an informed discussion about density and the real impact.

Council Member Lytle said the second question was about process and the
use of focus groups, as opposed to a broader and open community forum.
She questioned if the focus groups were advertised for the public to attend.

Mr. Emslie replied a broad cross-section was sought for the focus group.
Focus groups, by definition, were limited in size and only reviewed a
particular issue. He believed for the larger issue of density and the form
code, organized groups should be contacted.

Council Member Lytle felt a broader, more inclusive discussion accelerated
the progress. She said her last question would be about why property
owners, who wanted to build affordable housing, were not being engaged in
the housing site density selection process. She was speaking to private
parties that own property. She questioned whether a list could be collected
and those individuals be part of the broader community process.

Mr. Emslie replied yes. He said staff was preparing land use surveys to see
where zoning changes would be appropriate and would consult with the
landowners.
