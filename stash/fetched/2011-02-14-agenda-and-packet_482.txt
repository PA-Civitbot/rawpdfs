the Plant and to the environment; the average effluent concentration for 2006 through
2009 declined 49 percent compared to the average effluent concentration for 2001
through 2004 (Table 4-5). These reductions are believed to result primarily from the
dental amalgam program, not from other residential and commercial programs addressing
mercury, because they occurred after the takeback programs for thermometers,
thermostats, and fluorescent lamps had been in place for a number of years.

As shown in Figures 4-6 and 4-7, influent mercury concentrations have decreased
significantly since 2004. Influent samples are collected on a weekly basis. Since the
ordinance required installation of amalgam separators by March 31, 2005, data from 2001
through 2004 are used as the “pre-separator” baseline. The average influent concentration
for 2006 through 2009 was 37 percent lower than the average influent concentration for
2001 through 2004.
With respect to influent data gathering, there is a data gap that must be acknowledged.
Mercury amalgam particles are very dense, and are more likely to travel along the bottom
of sewer pipes than to be suspended throughout the water column. Due to the
configuration of the RWQCP influent sampling location, it is believed that some mercury
amalgam particles would not be captured in the influent samples. These amalgam
particles would not enter the RWQCP’s primary treatment process, but would be trapped
in the “grit” channel at the headworks of the RWQCP. Because the grit is highly
irregular, it is not feasible to conduct accurate, representative sampling. The grit is
disposed of at a landfill, and its pollutant content has never been included in the various
mass balances that have been conducted. Therefore, we recognize that undetected
decreases in the mercury content of that material may have occurred.
