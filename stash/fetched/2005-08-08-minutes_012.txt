Council Member Mossar expressed support for the motion and said it was
worth studying the site for auto dealers.

Mayor Burch said the City Manager did not want staff to pursue the matter if
the Council would not consider an auto dealership for the site.

Council Member Morton said he did not believe the community would accept
an auto dealership in the Baylands. He asked staff the cost to purchase 17
acres of land.

Mr. Emslie said land would cost approximately $3.2 million per acre.

Council Member Morton said the cost would be approximately $51 million to
replace the land.

Vice Mayor Kleinberg said it was requested that the MSC location be reviewed
first. The property would be redeveloped, not sold.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER that the motion will not involve any transfer of title
of land.

Council Member Kishimoto asked whether the City had to charge a market
rate for the property.

City Attorney Gary Baum said new laws prevented auto dealers from outside
the Cityâ€™s market, a 40-mile range determined by the Highway 101 corridor,
to be brought in or subsidized. It was possible there were limits on leasing
below the market rate. The land could not be sold below market.

Council Member Kishimoto said the City should try to keep the auto
dealerships.

Council Member Freeman said the MSC property was surrounded by open
space and an auto dealership would be intrusive.

Council Member Ojakian said the auto dealers indicated they did not have
enough space. It was important to be proactive to keep the dealerships in
Palo Alto.

MOTION PASSED 5-4 Cordell, Freeman, Kishimoto, Morton no.
