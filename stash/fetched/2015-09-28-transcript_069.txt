Council Member DuBois: Yeah, that's fine.

Mayor Holman: That's okay ...

Council Member Burt: That's fine.

Mayor Holman: ... with the maker and seconder?

Council Member Burt: (crosstalk) well overdue.

Council Member Wolbach: I understand, but I think it's important to be
clear for the Staff and for the record.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to add to the Motion Part C, “to add dedicated
wireless communications to increase communication” after “Issue RFP.”

Mayor Holman: Does Clerk have the language? Can you repeat the
language please for the Clerk? Okay, I think you've got it. Anything else?

Council Member Wolbach: That's all. Thanks.

Mayor Holman: I have three more lights. Council Members, it is 9:00.
Council Member Scharff, Filseth and Kniss. To the motion.

Council Member Scharff: Where it says wireless plans will not use fiber
funds at this time, I'd like to add "but will be revisited when we get the
updated wireless network report."

Mayor Holman: Council Member DuBois?

Council Member DuBois: Are you suggesting that's not when we revisit the
fiber and goals?

Council Member Scharff: I'm happy to revisit when we do the fiber goals.

Council Member DuBois: I want it to be tied to that.

Council Member Scharff: Yeah, I just want it to be revisited. I don't want it
to be just policy that sits there and we never talk about it.
