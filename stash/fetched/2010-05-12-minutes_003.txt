MOTION: Council Member Scharff moved, seconded by Council Member
Holman to direct Staff and the Planning & Transportation Commission to
not allow rezoning of commercial to residential, but allow mixed use with no
decrease of retail sites throughout the city.

Council Member Scharff spoke about the importance in protecting the
economic viability of the City.

Council Member Price asked whether the Motion would preclude any serious
examination of the Fry’s Electronic site.

Director of Planning and Community Environment, Curtis Williams stated the
Fry’s site was not presently in play for the Housing Element since their lease
expired in 2013.

Chief Planning & Transportation Officer, Julie Caporgno stated the Fry’s site
was zoned for residential uses, although it was currently being used for
commercial.

Council Member Holman asked whether the intention of the Motion was not
to increase the building envelope but to consider a multitude of mixed uses
that would include housing.

Council Member Scharff stated his Motion had a broader direction in order to
not limit the Council on future decisions of larger mixed uses.

Council Member Holman stated larger projects were subject to a Planned
Community (PC) Zoning.
