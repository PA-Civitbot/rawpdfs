Council Member Cordell asked for clarification of the project.

Council Member Beecham said the project was consideration of a future
recycling facility at the current landfill. To stop the project meant when the
current landfill operation was closed, it would become a park.

Council Member Mossar said she was reluctant to jettison recycling from the
community.

Council Member Morton said an important part of being a responsible
member of the world community was to deal with waste. An EIR would
provide information about alternatives.

Council Member Kishimoto said she had four motions: 1) prior to an EIR,
adopt the Auditor’s recommendations with a cost benefit analysis; 2) decline
an EIR; 3) establish a policy to close the landfill by 2011; and 4) analyze
grading aspects.

City Attorney Gary Baum said by Robert’s Rules and the Council’s own rules,
Council Members needed to speak to the substitute motion not the original
motion.

Council Member Ojakian asked whether continuing a transfer station at
Byxbee Park required undedication of parkland.

Mr. Roberts said the transfer station would be implemented after 2021 if an
agreement with Sunnyvale were not attained.

Council Member Ojakian asked whether Mr. Roberts was speaking about the
1.58 acres.

Mr. Roberts confirmed.

Council Member Ojakian said the 1.5 acres would not be needed until 2021.

Mr. Roberts said the land needed to be preserved.

Council Member     Ojakian   stated   some    parkland   would   need   to   be
undedicated.

Mr. Roberts confirmed.

Council Member Ojakian asked the City Auditor for the impact to the General
Fund if the motion passed.

City Auditor Sharon Erickson said the Refuse Fund currently transferred $4.3
million per year to the General Fund for rent of 47 acres of active landfill;
the agreement ended in 2011, but one half the rent continued through
2013/2014.
