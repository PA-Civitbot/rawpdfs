       contamination by exposing future occupants or
       users of the site to contamination in excess of
       soil and ground water cleanup goals developed
       for the site?

     DISCUSSION:
     The proposed project is minor in scope and does not involve the use, creation or transportation of
     hazardous materials. California Avenue is not designated as an evacuation route nor located within or
     near the wildland fire danger area. The proposed project would have no impacts with regard to public
     safety, hazards and hazardous materials.
