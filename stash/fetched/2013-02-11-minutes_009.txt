Adina Levin, speaking as a Sierra Club Member and as an individual,
appreciated the Council's review of ABAG methodology. The State's metric
for housing affordability should include transportation. From a Sierra Club
perspective, cities should look for in-fill development opportunities rather
than using the built-out argument.

Council Member Holman indicated the City Attorney provided an at-places
communication regarding the two methods the Council could approach an
appeal. One ground for appeal was the basic formula used to determine
RHNA. A second ground was individual allocations assigned to the agency.
The RHMC recommended the appeal focus on the second ground, or
allocation of the Stanford units. She noted a typographical error on packet

appeal, provide a solid argument, and achieve the goal of reducing the
RHNA. He was concerned that taking on all disagreements would result in
the failure of all appeals.

Council Member Schmid believed the draft letter focused on the allocation
process with ABAG. He referenced California Code sections regarding the
process for appeal. It was important for the appeal to cite the problem in

AMENDMENT TO MOTION: Council Member Schmid moved, seconded by
Council Member Klein to add Point Number One from the City of Palo Alto
letter dated September 11, 2012 packet page 496 inserting an appeal based
on the population numbers and send copies to the Departments of Finance
and Housing.

Council Member Schmid favored appealing the transfer of 350 units;
however, this only slightly affected the impact on the City. Appealing on the
