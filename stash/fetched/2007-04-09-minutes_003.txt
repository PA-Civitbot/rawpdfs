The City Council of the City of Palo Alto met on this date in the Council

Mayor Kishimoto asked the City Manager for update on the Redwood City
fire.

City Manager Frank Benest stated on Saturday, April 7 there was a fire in an
auto yard in Redwood City. The Fire and Police Chiefs advised they were
trying to use outreach including the Teleminder System, which failed.
Through outreach to the newspapers, the neighborhood associations, as well
as other sources, citizens were requested to stay inside and close their
windows to minimize smoke inhalation. They have received a number of
proposals to get new technology to increase the number of calls made in an
hour.

Council Member Kleinberg stated with the Teleminder System not working,
why wasn’t the Winter Storm Watch strategy utilized and, also, is there a
schedule of testing the communications system to find out beforehand
whether it is operating.

Mr. Benest replied he would have a response after the investigation.

Council Member Kleinberg stated there was a task force that came up with a
strategy to have trucks travel through the neighborhoods to announce there
was an emergency.

Mr. Benest stated this would be evaluated as it would enhance the City’s
response.

Council Member Mossar said when the Teleminder System was activated the
Council should have been notified. She asked about the staff policy on
notification of the Council.
