Mayor Klein stated they are asking Council to authorize a cash flow and
needs assessment with a proposed budget for implementation, but that it
seemed this had already been done.

Mr. Emslie stated it has been done internally but has not been coordinated
with the Administrative Services Department (ASD).

Mayor Klein asked if they could have this at the first meeting in September.

Mr. Emslie stated they would find out and report back.

Mayor Klein stated they should get back to Council in August if they cannot
return in September, because he does not see the problem in proceeding.
He voiced concern over the LED technology not quite being ready for
deployment and asked where they were on this.

Ms. Weiss stated they are seeing the costs come down, with positives to
waiting on things as the costs continue to decrease. She stated there are
pilot LED spots in the City and they are looking on expanding locations.

Mayor Klein asked if this meant full implementation throughout the City
would stretch over a long time period.

Ms. Weiss stated the recommendation includes bringing the lights down and
working them into the LED replacement schedule.

Mayor Klein asked if there were problems with staff, in any department, on
technical grounds of the program.

Ms. Weiss stated there are concerns, but she felt the pilot projects have
boosted confidence in LED replacement and its benefits.

Mayor Klein asked if there were other cities they could look to for models.

Ms. Weiss stated staff would review San Jose, San Mateo City and County,
and Austin, Texas.

Mayor Klein asked if segways were being considered in vehicle replacement.

Ms. Nagel stated this was not considered.

Mayor Klein stated other communities use them, why not Palo Alto.

Ms. Nagel stated it had not come up in talks with the Fleet Manager.
