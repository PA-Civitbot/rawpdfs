Mr. Williams stated there were setbacks of approximately thirty feet from
property lines and there were limitations on impervious surfaces with no
requirements to maintain natural areas on private property.

Mayor Drekmeier asked who held the responsibility of clearing the land to
maintain the buffer with regard to private property.

Mr. Williams stated there was no requirement from the Planning
Department and noted there may be a Fire Department requirement.

Ms. Rice stated the City was not required to create the defensible space for
adjacent private land. She mentioned the City currently maintained the
perimeter for the private property in the area.

Mayor Drekmeier asked whether there were plans in place to create a
canopy for shade and aesthetics.

Ms. Rice stated yes, and noted the removal of the shrubbery around the
perimeter of trees created growth for trees.

Mayor Drekmeier asked whether there were plans to establish more tree
planting.

Ms. Rice stated there was an adequate number of existing trees and
therefore there had not been additional monies requested for tree planting.

Council Member Kishimoto asked for clarification of the roadside clearing.

Ms. Rice stated the fire intensity by roadside where shrubbery was
maintained at the minimum ten feet did not allow for safe evacuation.

Council Member Kishimoto asked whether twenty feet would be adequate.

Ms. Rice stated in some areas the clearing was restricted to twenty feet
although in areas where there were no restrictions, twenty feet was not
adequate for safety.

Council Member Kishimoto stated a twenty foot clearing could be workable.

Ms. Rice stated yes, dependent upon the shrubbery type.

Council Member Kishimoto asked what research had been compiled on the
treatment of fire management in surrounding areas.
