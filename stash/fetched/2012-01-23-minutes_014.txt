Ms. French explained the Master License Agreement concerned trees within
the street rights of way. She did not know of any reason to encourage
installations in backyards.

Council Member Schmid asked if the ARB's purview included making
decisions for emergencies.

Ms. French thought Staff tried to determine the minimum equipment that
needed to be on the pole and tried to add value to the recommendation by
requesting removal of the battery box. She stated the ARB heard the
applicant's reasoning and considered the City's goal for emergency services,
both of which outweighed the aesthetic component.

Council Member Schmid asked if legally the ARB was to consider aesthetics
only.

Ms. French indicated that was the thrust of the Architectural Review.

Council Member Schmid mentioned one statement that the State determined
the fee the City could charge for using the utility pole and another statement
that the City could create fees and incentives. He asked if the Council had
the discretion to set fees or costs of applications.

Assistant City Attorney, Don Larkin, referenced the new law limiting the
Council's discretion on the fees for pole attachments. He stated the City had
less discretion regarding the fees on pole attachments, but more discretion
regarding fees for poles on City substation sites.

Council Member Schmid asked if the City could charge application and
hearing fees.

Mr. Williams answered yes. He thought the application review fees stood on
their own, and applicants had to pay the cost of that service; however, the
cost to rent a pole for a pole attachment was different.

Council Member Schmid inquired whether the earlier comment regarding
incentives fit into the fact that the City could charge fees.

Mr. Williams agreed it would fit into that or, as Mr. Larkin indicated, the pole
was on City sites.
