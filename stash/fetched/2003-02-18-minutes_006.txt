Council Member Kishimoto registered a "no" vote on Item No. 8 and
commented she was surprised that the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise
(DBE) program (Item No. 3) dropped from 25 percent to 3 percent. She
hoped the City would look into the matter to see if there was anything they
could do differently.

Assistant Director of Administrative Services Lalo Perez clarified the DBE
program was not about minority or women-owned businesses; it was about
disadvantaged businesses that were perhaps owned by minorities or women.
A member of the DBE group would need to register with the State of
California. The City pulled its list from the State.

Council Member Freeman recommended the City extend its area in the
future to look for people who may fall into the group of a disadvantaged
business. She commented on Item No. 7 that with the increased number of
management positions in the City, she hoped it was the opposite direction
the City intended to go with the current budget crisis.

Mayor Mossar announced that Item Nos. 2, 5 and 8 would be removed from
the Consent Calendar to become Item Nos. 8A, 8B, and 8C respectively.

MOTION PASSED 9-0 for Item Nos. 1, 3, 4, 6 and 7.

8A.   (Old Item No. 2) Ordinance Amending Section 18.08.040 of the Palo
      Alto Municipal Code (The Zoning Map) to Change the Classification of
      Property Known as 800 High Street From CD-S(P) to PC Planned
      Community and Approving a Variance from a Height Requirement

Larry Hassett, 875 Alma Street, spoke against the rezoning of 800 High
Street to a Planned Community (PC). He believed the PC process in Palo Alto
was wrong. At the February 3, 2003 Council meeting, the City was faced
with the following: 1) an applicant not fully prepared to come before the
Council but pushed forward because of self-imposed timelines; 2) a staff
that allowed an incomplete application and an entirely new second proposal,
that was not reviewed or considered by staff, the public, or commissions;
