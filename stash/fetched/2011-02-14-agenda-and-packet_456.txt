combustion chamber during typical startup and shutdown sequences. Most malfunctions are addressed by
promptly shutting off the feed to the incinerator.




                                                                                                                   Attachment: PA Comments EPA HQ-OAR-2009-0559_Final (1297 : EPA Proposed Rule on Sewage Sludge Incinerators)

        Again, EPA’s Proposed Rule, if finalized, would have a significant negative impact on the POTWs that
rely on incineration and further constrain the list of available sludge management options. NACWA
encourages EPA to take the time now to develop a more thorough and accurate understanding of this sector
before finalizing emission standards for SSIs.

        We appreciate your consideration of these comments. Please do not hesitate to contact Chris Hornback
