free speech carries responsibilities. There are limits and it is hard for
Council to listen to scurrilous attacks made to staff and also Council
Members. Although she wouldn’t push the balance any other way because
free speech needs to be given extreme latitude, it is comforting to
sometimes stop and say we don’t like what we hear sometimes and we are
sorry that sometimes things are said the way they are said.

No action required.
