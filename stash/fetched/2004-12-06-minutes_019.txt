Vice Mayor Burch said the applicant mentioned the project would contain
three-bedroom houses.

Mr. Byrd said Mr. Midgal had not mentioned three-bedroom houses.

Mayor Beecham said the applicant had not made that testimony.

Mr. Byrd said he did not want to presume the bedroom count.

Mayor Beecham declared the Public Hearing closed at 10:50 p.m.

Planning and Transportation Commissioner Annette Bialson said the P&TC
did not feel comfortable with five homes on the parcel.

Council Member Morton asked about lot size and density.

Mr. Emslie said the gross figure included the creek easement.     The Code
excluded creek easements from lot areas for building purposes.

Council Member Morton said he had a problem with the density at 792
Matadero Avenue when the split was acceptable, but with similar lot sizes
across the street it became too dense. He asked for an explanation.

Ms. Bialson said there was concern about the size of the cul-de-sac and the
protected trees on the parcel.

Council Member Morton said the arborist and the clientâ€™s tree specialist had
answered those concerns but not to the satisfaction of the P&TC.

Ms. Bialson confirmed. There was substantial public testimony the P&TC had
listened to.

Council Member Morton asked how the traffic issue was measured.

Ms. Bialson said the generation of traffic was a minor issue. The impact
would be caused from lack of parking on the cul-de-sac, which would force
parking onto Matadero Avenue.

Council Member Morton said there were three houses where parking
overflowed directly onto Matadero. He asked how it could be worse where
there was a cul-de-sac where some of the traffic would be absorbed by the
cul-de-sac.
