Council Member Cordell asked whether the City Attorney felt there were any
legal problems in the event the Secretary of the Interior Standards were
changed later.

City Attorney Gary Baum said his understanding was that the document was
heavily negotiated. Secretary of the Interior Guidelines would be referred to as
opposed to regulations. The regulations had to be followed if they were in place
at the time the contract was entered into. Staff had to make sure the
contracting party, Palo Alto Stanford Heritage (PAST), was in agreement with
this change.

Assistant City Manager Emily Harrison said both staff and PAST agreed they
would work cooperatively on the project.

Council Member Klein said he supported the project and congratulated the
people who did a terrific job in fundraising.

MOTION PASSED 9-0.
