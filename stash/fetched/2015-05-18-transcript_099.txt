Mayor Holman: I don't remember any conversation about the definition of
eating and drinking.

Ms. Gitelman: I thought there was some earlier discussion by Council about
formula retail being defined to focus on restaurant and eating and drinking
uses and not hardware stores, paint stores.

Mayor Holman: Did I just totally miss that?

Council Member Burt: Let's take an example. Say hypothetically we had a
Walgreens that wanted to come in there. Would we want to limit it or not?

Mayor Holman: My intention was formula retail, so chains no matter
whether they're restaurants or whatever.

Ms. Gitelman: Thank you for clarifying that.

Mayor Holman: I had not caught any other discussion otherwise.             Maker
and seconder accepted formula retail on California Avenue.

Council Member Wolbach: I do accept that one.

Council Member Burt: My final one is to clarify that "q" is intended to be—is
it not any longer "q"? "P," is that what it is now? Yeah, that "p" is not
intended to be under the same urgency that the balance is. Maybe we just
direct Staff to analyze and return to Council on a less urgent basis—wait a
minute. Maybe at the end of the sentence, "and to do so on a less urgent
basis than the above directives."

Council Member Scharff: That was fine with me.

Council Member Burt: I don't know if my wording is ...

Mayor Holman: It's not your Motion.

Council Member Scharff: It was my Amendment.

Council Member Burt: It was accepted by the maker and the seconder, so
they would have to accept this change.

Mayor Holman: That's okay. Council Member Wolbach, you okay?

Council Member Wolbach: I'm comfortable with that change. I accept it.
