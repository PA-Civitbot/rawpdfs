Robert Moss spoke regarding AT&T postcards asking the public to provide
positive feedback regarding towers. He explained the Architectural Review
Board (ARB) had rejected AT&T's proposals regarding the towers. Mr. Moss
stated that AT&T was not complying with the ARB's comments and that its
technology was obsolete. He expressed his hope that the City Council and
Staff would reject AT&T's proposal. He stated he opposed their current
project, and hoped AT&T would implement a project that fit Palo Alto and
would not destroy the community.

Omar Chatty mentioned the deaths of two people on Caltrain tracks. He
asked how many additional people must die prior to opening discussions on
replacing Caltrain. He asked that the City Council investigate this with
respect to liability, health, and welfare of citizens. He provided information
on deaths related to trains in Palo Alto.
