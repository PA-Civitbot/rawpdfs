Thomas Jones said he received his Bachelors of Science of Civil Engineering
from California State University in 1992.

Council Member Cordell asked for his comments on the e-mail submitted by
the City Auditor.

Mr. Jones said there was a misunderstanding with the dependency on Direct
TV. 180 Connect was a public company and had the ability to work with
multiple companies at any given time. As far as the finances are concerned,
Steve Westberg was in attendance to answer those questions.

Council Member Cordell asked whether he disagreed with the findings or not.

Mr. Jones said he disagreed with the layout of the findings.

Bill Terry, 925 Laurel Glen Drive, said if the broadband network was not
available to cover the entire city; it should not be referred to as “citywide.”

Wayne Martin, 3687 Bryant, did not support the broadband movement at
this time.

MOTION: Council Member Beecham moved, seconded by Klein, to direct
staff concerning the Citywide Ultra-High-Speed Broadband system project,
based upon one of the two options below:

      1)    Confirm the City’s commitment to proceed with the project given
            that the City’s financial commitment to the project to:
            a)    Direct 180 Connect Network Services, Inc. to develop a
                  business plan at its own expense; and
            b)    Authorize the use of $65,000 in Council Contingency funds
                  to hire legal, financial and telecommunications consultants
                  to support the City’s role in the development of the
                  business plan.

Mr. Saccio said staff would meet weekly for follow-up.

Council Member Cordell asked what the $65,000 was funding.

Director of Administrative Services Carl Yeats said the funding was to
support staffs’ efforts towards the completion of the business plan and other
areas of the broadband movement.
