COUNCIL COMMENTS, QUESTIONS, AND ANNOUNCEMENTS

Council Member Kleinberg noted the challenge to find appropriate ways to
channel enthusiasm of new members to be appointed to various committees
and commissions.

Mayor Mossar noted most assignments aspired to were not appointed by the
Council but by other agencies.

Council Member Freeman noted on Item No. 5 that the Planning and
Transportation Commission minutes regarding residential units conforming
to R-1 were inaccurate. Transfer of Development Rights (TDR), which
allowed a person developing to transfer rights to a different property, were
intended to be bought and sold. She also congratulated Police Chief Lynne
Johnson on her promotion.

Council Member Kleinberg requested the meeting be adjourned in honor of
Community Association for Rehabilitation (C.A.R.) on its 40th Anniversary.

FINAL ADJOURNMENT: The meeting adjourned at 11:50 p.m. in honor of
CAR, which was celebrating its 40th year in Palo Alto and had served many in
the community with developmental disabilities.
