Council Member Burt asked if there were other instances where seismic
bonuses had not counted against the FAR.

Mr. Williams stated he would find out.

Council Member Burt stated it was odd for the basement to qualify as an
exemption for seismic bonus and not qualify for FAR exemption.

Council Member Morton asked if these had to be DEEâ€™s to be allowed, and if
they were determined to be Variances, does the terminology matter, with
one being legal and one not being legal.

Mr. Williams stated the terminology mattered in terms of the findings
required.     He stated both required that there be some unusual
circumstances making it difficult to achieve without the exception, but the
DEE criteria required enhanced design.

Council Member     Morton   asked   if   a   Variance   could   have   a   design
enhancement.

Mr. Williams stated the Variance also has to show that there was a hardship
situation if it was not approved.

Council Member Morton asked if there were multiple street corners with
setbacks and if one of those was intruded upon would that set a precedent.

Mr. Williams stated he did not believe so since they were looking at four
street corners as they relate physically to the project and that the three
other properties were not as narrow or constrained.

Council Member Morton asked if this was a unique change to the street
corner.

Mr. Williams replied yes.

Council Member Morton asked whether the change to the street corner
would bring the area into conformance.

Mr. Williams stated yes.

Council Member Morton asked about the merit of commercial main floors
being more successful with higher ceilings.
