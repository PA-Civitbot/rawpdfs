Mr. Williams stated the ARB review did include findings specific to the
policy’s relevant to the SOFA II Plan.

Council Member Kishimoto asked whether the elevator provided was easily
accessible from the exterior and large enough to support bicycles. She noted
concern the project was moving towards a bike friendly environment yet the
bike parking was not easily accessible.

Mr. Williams stated Staff would work with the Applicant on establishing more
accessibility for the bike parking, bike ramps, and ensure the elevator met
the size requirement.

Council Member Kishimoto asked whether the architecture was compatible to
the surrounding area.

Mr. Williams stated the architectural design was reviewed, compared, and
met the SOFA II compatibility requirements.

Council Member Kishimoto stated the project was designed as a family living
area but the play space was neither in site of the homes nor in a lit area.

Mr. Williams stated the ARB had commented on the play area and was
informed the open space area was viewable from the office buildings and the
community room.

Council Member Kishimoto stated the lack of balcony was still a concern for
her. She stated the SOFA II Plan was designed for the family’s to have open
air access and she asked why the balconies were not designed into the
housing proposal.

Mr. Quigley stated the project had floor to ceiling glass with large windows
which granted access to fresh air and light to the units. He clarified it was
architecturally feasible to add French Balconies.

Ms. Schmidt added, balconies were a maintenance issue and often times
residents would store items on the balcony which was why balconies were
not being proposed.

Council Member Kishimoto suggested adding French Balconies, the play area
being more visible to the homes, and more bike parking as an Amendment
to the Motion.
