Bob Moss, 4010 Orme Street, said libraries should be improved before storm
drains. He emphasized storm drains should be paid out of the Capital
Improvement Project Fund and not the General Fund.

Lynn Chiapella, 631 Colorado Avenue, spoke regarding the issue of street
repairs being done piecemeal. Streets would get repaired but not the
gutters making them unsuitable to handle the storm drain water. She said
there should have been more coordination between getting the streets,
sidewalks, curbs and gutters completed at the same time.      Completing
projects separately only resulted in spending more money on redoing the
work.

No action required.

ADJOURNMENT: The meeting adjourned at 7:40 p.m.
