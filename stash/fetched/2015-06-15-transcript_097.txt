Council Member Burt: That was not clear to me. I missed that one. Bottom
line is we can't resolve this tonight.

Council Member Wolbach: Where it says "is complete," if we change that to
"was complete" and inserted a date to cover those two projects, 2747 and
3045, a week ago, a month ago, whatever a date was, would that find
enough support that we could make a deal and move on?

Council Member Burt: I'd support that.

Mayor Holman: What is that date and how do we find that date?

Council Member Burt: Hillary, were you hearing what Cory said?

Council Member Wolbach: I don't know if it would get Scharff's support. It
still might not get the votes.

Ms. Gitelman: Again, I would need to research the timing of all these
applications and their completeness. The only thing I can say is as of
March 31st, this table accurately reflected what was complete and what
wasn't.

Council Member Wolbach: If we said March 31st, how would the maker and
seconder feel about that?

Council Member Scharff: I'm very uncomfortable with the notion that we're
now picking on two people and saying, "We've decided that we have too
much and we're going to cut them back."

Council Member Burt: That's a no.

Council Member Scharff: Yeah, it's a no. If you take the 3045 Park
Boulevard one, that was the one that we were going to put the fire station
on.

Council Member Wolbach: I will offer that as an amendment.

Council Member Burt: Second.

Mayor Holman: You'll offer what as an amendment?

Council Member Wolbach:    To change it to application was complete as of
March 31, 2015.
