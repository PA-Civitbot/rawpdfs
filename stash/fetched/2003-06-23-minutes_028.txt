Council Member Kishimoto stated she voted to approve Item No. 13, but
requested that staff provide alternatives when they returned with an
agreement with City of Cupertino. She had gone to an Association of Bay
Area Government (ABAG) meeting and rode the first new BART connection
to SFO.

Council Member Lytle noted she previously had requested information on
whether there was a contingency plan on IKEA, but she did not intend to
give direction to staff.

Council Member Freeman clarified her “no” vote on Item No. 9 was due to
her disagreement with the CIP on the Baylands Conversion Project involving
cable television lines in the Baylands.

Council Member Lytle questioned why the four public hearings were placed
on the agenda when they were all continued.

Assistant City Manager Emily Harrison responded many public hearings
needed to be placed on agendas within specific timelines.

Council Member Kleinberg noted that two Council Appointed Officers had
received recognition: City Manager Frank Benest was awarded the 2003
Clarence E. Ridley Memorial Award from the International City/County
Management Association (ICMA) for his work in the area of employee
training, and City Attorney Calonne was awarded “Public Lawyer of the Year”
from the California State Bar Association.

ADOURNMENT: The meeting adjourned at 11:00 p.m.
