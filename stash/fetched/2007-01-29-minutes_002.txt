Mayor Kishimoto requested clarification of       the   follow-up   information
regarding the hazardous materials leak at CPI.

Emily Harrison reported staff has met with CPI to try to have them reduce
the materials currently on site.

Fire Chief Nick Marinaro noted the Fire Marshal has been in touch with CPI
and, although there is no timeline, staff is working aggressively to take care
of several issues.

Ms. Harrison noted many issues have been identified, such as meeting with
the Barron Park Neighborhood Group, having the community understand
how staff responds to hazardous materials incidents and how staff is trained,
and how as a community member they would prepare and respond to
different levels of an event, and the notification issue (100 foot entitlement
for storage).
