Council Member Freeman asked about the administrative record of
compliance issues and complaints. She said when there had been
complaints, could an establishment be asked to follow stricter guidelines,
regardless of what other establishments were doing.

Mr. Emslie said the conditions Council deemed necessary to reduce the level
of impact to achieve objectives for compatibility between land uses were
within the discretion of the City Council.

limitation on a business establishment.

was legal.

for Council consideration be considered regarding the closure of Parking Lot
