                         TRANSCRIPT
Mayor Burt: I then clarified that we did give guidance to the CAC, but we
did not place it in formal Motions. It was in Council comments, extensive
and pretty clear comments amongst each of the Council Members that the
Staff can summarize for the CAC based upon the comments that were made.

Mr. Keene: We're going to come back with the feasibility assessment on this
directive. This items' going to be on your Agenda. You're going to have
another discussion and many more on this item.

Mayor Burt: Council Member Berman was raising the issue of in our
comments we really didn't talk about these other alternative housing sites
that were cited, Palo Alto Square and places like that. No, we didn't and I'm
not interested in taking it up at this hour. Not a bad topic, but we just have
our limits on what we can do here.
