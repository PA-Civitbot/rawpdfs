19, 1999 (CMR 284:99) and elements of the Comprehensive Plan, specifically:
    1. GOAL N-9: A clean, efficient, competitively-priced energy supply that makes use of
       cost-effective renewable resources, and Policies
    2. POLICY N-44: Maintain Palo Alto’s long-term supply of electricity and natural gas
       while addressing environmental and economic concerns.

ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW
Execution of the Agreement does not constitute a project for the purposes of the California
Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). Solano County is the lead agency for the Shiloh wind
generation facility, but the City is not a responsible agency, because it currently lacks any
responsibility for carrying out or approving the construction of the facility.
