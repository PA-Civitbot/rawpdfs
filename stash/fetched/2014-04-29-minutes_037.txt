Council Member Schmid believed there should be records of planes flying
lower than the minimum altitude. The City received a notice of complaints in
December 2013, and no complaints were submitted from Palo Alto. He
asked if data for Palo Alto was missing or if residents did not complain.

Mr. Carl indicated people had given up on the Roundtable because it did
nothing.

Council Member Holman encouraged Staff to continue collecting data. Noise
was a nuisance and a health issue. That should be prominent in comments.

Council Member Klein suggested Staff talk to the City's Federal lobbyist and
send a copy of letters to Congress Members Honda and Logfren.

Bert Ganoung, San Francisco Aircraft Noise Abatement Office Manager,
reported the San Francisco International Airport (SFO) would not comment
on the draft EA. One of the routes from the south was a direct overlay
according to the FAA. Changes to the route occurred over Monterey Bay to
provide fewer emissions, utilize less fuel, and create less noise. The FAA
was changing existing profiles and arrivals. Most of those changes were 20
miles and more from airports.

Mayor Shepherd asked if Mr. Ganoung meant Palo Alto residents were not
experiencing more airplane noise.

Mr. Ganoung could not say people were not experiencing something
different.

Mayor Shepherd asked if Mr. Ganoung could describe what residents
experienced.

Mr. Ganoung would have to interview residents individually to do that.

Mayor Shepherd inquired whether technically nothing had changed.

Mr. Ganoung responded yes. On a good day, the noise teardrop was closer
to the airport; on a bad day it would extend further south. That was a fact
of sequencing airplanes.

Mayor Shepherd inquired whether the City should have received notice of
issues.
