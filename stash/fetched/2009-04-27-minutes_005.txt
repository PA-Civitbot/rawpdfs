REPORTS OF OFFICIALS

13.   Update on City Sustainability and Environmental Initiatives.

Environmental Specialist Julie Weiss gave a presentation regarding the Less-
toxic Pest Control Program for City Operations as outlined in Staff Report
CMR:228:09.

Council Member Espinosa asked if Staff anticipated savings or additional
costs in switching over to alternative pest management techniques and was
the program’s effectiveness being measured.

Ms. Weiss said it depended on whether it was a landscaping or structural
pest control. The City was using a contractor that assisted with various
repairs that resulted in less frequent use for their services. The pest control
was a new decision and information would be tracked closely.

Council Member Barton said the chart used in the presentation noted a
decrease in insecticides and asked for clarification.
