Historical Resources Board (HRB) to have them look at whether this was
appropriate or not.

Council Member Cordell stated this was about the City making a statement
that we care about issues of civil rights, freedom of speech and recognizing
that these individuals brought certain issues to the forefront. The Kings did
have connections to Palo Alto through Stanford and through Clay Carson
who was a Professor at Stanford. She did support the renaming of the plaza.

Council Member Drekmeier stated that Palo Alto used to be a segregated
community and there were a number of neighborhoods where nonwhites
could not buy a home. He stated that the Kingâ€™s represented Palo Alto as a
tolerant community which was progressive in many ways and he did support
the renaming of the plaza.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION: Council Member Mossar moved, seconded by
Morton to refer the recommendation of the Policy and Services Commission
to the Historic Resources Board for their comments and suggestions
specifically the question, should the City Hall plaza be named for the Kings.

Assistant City Manager Emily Harrison stated it had already gone to the HRB.

Council Member Mossar asked whether the HRB was asked what should have
been named after the Kings.

Ms. Harrison stated that they had.

Council Member Mossar stated they should be asked what name the Plaza
should have.

Council Member Morton stated that the citizens had expressed to him that
the Council takes action without regard for the community. He stated there
was a very thin connection between the Kings and Palo Alto and he agreed
with the Substitute Motion.

Vice Mayor Klein stated he did not support the Motion or the Substitute
Motion.

Mayor Kishimoto stated this has been before a number of committees since
January and she did not support the Substitute Motion.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION FAILED:             3-5 Kleinberg, Morton, Mossar yes,
Beecham absent.
