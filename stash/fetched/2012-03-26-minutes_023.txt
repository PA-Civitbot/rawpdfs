redevelopment required a negotiated sale between the purchaser and seller.
He noted the redevelopment agencies could not deliver sites as they had
previously, and that was one of the factors working in Palo Alto's favor.

Council Member Klein asked if Staff had spoken with other dealerships, not
just Anderson.

Mr. Fehrenbach replied yes. He had spoken with Chrysler, Ford and Charlie
Burton who owned the Subaru and Audi dealerships.

Council Member Klein inquired if discussions had included the potential use
of the Los Altos Treatment Plant Site.

Mr. Fehrenbach answered yes, most specifically for the back-of-house
services of storage and service.

Council Member Klein asked if Mr. Anderson had indicated a willingness to
trade some of his land on Embarcadero as part of a transaction.

Mr. Fehrenbach reported he would need a certain portion of his current site
for service and storage, but he might not need the entire site. Some of that
land could be available for City use.

Council Member Klein suggested it could be used for an animal shelter.

Council Member Shepherd thought this was an interesting option. She said
the different locations of auto dealerships were illogical. She asked if Staff
tracked sales tax for Toyota, because they had a decent location in Palo Alto.

Mr. Fehrenbach indicated that was a good example of the grow-in-place
model, as they had improved with expansion over the past few years. He
stated almost all auto dealerships in Palo Alto between 2007 and 2009
experienced a decrease in overall sales.

Council Member Shepherd asked if the Toyota dealership was experiencing
an increase from the end of the recession.

Mr. Fehrenbach responded they were.

Mr. Emslie reported the tsunami in March 2011 had disrupted the supply
chain for Japanese car models, which had affected sales.
