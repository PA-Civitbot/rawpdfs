Vice Mayor Espinosa asked whether Agenda Item Nos. 26, 27 and 28 were of
an urgent nature.

Mr. Keene stated the items in question were of a contractual nature which
had been reviewed and were ready for Council approval. In the event they
were pushed out until September that would be a six week delay. Item No.
26, the Feasibility Study, had a timeline designated by the Council.

Mayor Burt stated there was a special Council meeting being held on
Thursday, August 05, 2010 and noted the time sensitive items could be
moved to that date.

21.   Resolution 9091 Calling a Special Election for November 2, 2010
      Submitting to the Electorate for Special Election a Measure to Amend
      Article III, Section 3 of the Charter to Change City Council Elections to
      Even-Numbered Years and Extend the Terms of Current Council
      Members to Five Years.

City Clerk, Donna Grider gave a brief introduction of the estimated cost
saving for an election transition. The Registrar of Voters estimated an
election in the year 2012 would cost approximately $111,000 while an
election in the year 2011 would range, depending on the number of
Measures on the Ballot, from $136,313 to $268,755. As a result there could
be a potential savings going to even year elections of approximately $26,313
to $157,755. She noted to place this Measure on the Ballot in 2010 there
would be a $100,000 fee and the School District would be impacted in
election costs since they were odd year elections.

Council Member Shepherd asked whether the School District and Foothill/De
Anza were allowed to move their election year.

City Manager, James Keene stated the School Superintendent had been
informed of the possibility of the City moving forward with changing their
election year and had been informed of the Council discussion for this
evening.

Council Member Shepherd asked for the School District to make an election
year change would they need to do so as their own body.

Ms. Grider stated yes.

Mayor Burt asked for clarification on the term by their own body, which
meant the School District and the Community College did or did not have to
go to the voters.
