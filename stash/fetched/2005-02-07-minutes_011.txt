Modify Page 2 of the Ordinance to give direction to staff that the TDR bids
return to the Council when the Request for Proposal (RFP) is issued and bids
accepted, as per the City’s formal bidding procedures.

     Ordinance 1st Reading entitled “Ordinance Amending Title 18 [Zoning]
     of the Palo Alto Municipal Code to Amend Chapters 18.32 [Public
     Facilities District Regulations], 18.49 [CD Commercial Downtown
     District Regulations], and 18.87 [Transferable Developments Rights] to
     Include Certain City-Owned Buildings as Sender Sites in the
     Transferable Development Rights Program”

City Attorney Gary Baum suggested the bidding process be directed to staff
because it was a process to be adopted under the Code and not be codified.
It would mean amending the Ordinance each time a change was made.

Council Member Morton suggested adding the words “the City’s formal
bidding procedures” to clarify a bidding procedure was already in place and
must be followed.

Mr. Baum agreed.

Council Member Kishimoto accepted the change to the motion.

Council Member Beecham asked for a summary on the history of TDR sales
in Palo Alto.

Mr. Emslie said there were six sales since the program started ten years
prior.

Council Member Beecham said the program had been around awhile but with
moderate activity. The process enabled the City to take advantage of what
the private sector was able to use. There were several buildings up for
renovation, but the process was slow and did not happen regularly. It gave
the City flexibility and offered funds for renovations to be made by the
community. He asked Council Member Kishimoto what her intentions were
on the SOFA 2 mixed use standards and the 5,000 to 10,000 square foot
