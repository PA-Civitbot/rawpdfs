to do all that is within their power to preserve Buena Vista. We are
extremely concerned especially about Buena Vista Children and how quickly
families will have to act in order to get them into new schools by August, at
the latest September of this year. Time is running out, but we the residents
are hoping for a better outcome like the one that Supervisor Simitian is
working on. This will only happen if everyone pulls together, including our
City, your City of Palo Alto. Please highly consider our situation. We need
your help. Our situation is urgent. Thank you.
