City Attorney Gary Baum suggested dividing it into two votes.

MOTION WITHDRAWN BY MAKER AND SECONDER

MOTION: Vice Mayor Burch moved, seconded by Kishimoto, to approve the
City Auditor’s 2004-05 Work Plan.

Council Member Morton stated he would not participate in the portion of the
item regarding Comcast due to a conflict of interest because he had family
holdings in telecommunications stock.

Council Member Ojakian stated he would not participate in the portion of the
item regarding Comcast due to a conflict of interest because he had family
holdings in telecommunications stock.

Council Member Freeman expressed her support for the motion, and
understood the City Auditor’s workload. She believed it was important to get
a handle on staffing or at least have the ability to clearly communicate the
rationale for higher than average ratio of staff to residents. She also hoped
staff continued with an audit of the Code to allow an open and inclusive
government of contracting practices and to eliminate sole sourcing.

Vice Mayor Burch asked whether the comments of Council Member Freeman
would come under Council Comments, or whether it was a directive to the
City Auditor.

Mayor Beecham said Council Member Freeman did not give staff a directive,
nor did she make any additions to the motion. She just expressed her
opinions.

MOTION PASSED 9-0.
