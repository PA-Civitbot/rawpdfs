Mr. Keene stated the data received showed the City had received a return on
investment; however, he could not recommend to the Council to continue
with Destination Palo Alto based on the metrics.

Council Member Espinosa asked whether there was a benchmark completed
prior to the program beginning in order to present a comparable return on
investment after the one year mark.

Ms. Le Clair stated the benchmarking process began last quarter. She stated
the first year there were no metrics due to the length of time it took to book
a room from the lead.

Council Member Espinosa stated what was requested was a baseline data to
compare the program now to verify there were increases.

Council Member Kishimoto asked what benefits would be reduced if the
budget to the program was reduced from $240,000 to $120,000.

Ms. Le Clair stated Palo Alto paid similar amounts as the surrounding cities.

Council Member Kishimoto clarified the amount requested was calculated
proportionate by the number of rooms available.

Ms. Le Clair stated yes, and it worked out to a similar amount with what the
other cities were paying.

Council Member Kishimoto asked about special assessments.

Ms. Le Clair stated a special assessment was a tourist fee passed on to the
visitor.

Council Member Kishimoto asked the basis of the fee.

Ms. Le Clair stated it was $0.15 to a $1.50 dependent upon the size of
meeting space and level of service.

Council Member Kishimoto asked whether it was a County-wide calculation.

Ms. Le Clair stated yes, there was a formula followed to achieve the specified
amount.

Council Member Kishimoto asked whether the fee was considered a tax.

Ms. Le Clair stated no, it was a tourist fee which fell under the California
Highway Code.
