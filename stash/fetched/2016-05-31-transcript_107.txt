sessions on their own, so you hit the ground running. We have some ways
to assign what things you may want higher, you're concerned about, what
things are lower. We could mine it quickly.

Mayor Burt: On that note, the meeting'sâ€”Cory.

Council Member Wolbach: I was just going to add that the only minor
complaint that I had was that we didn't get very much of this in our packet
in advance. It would have been useful to have it in advance to help prepare
and make this more efficient. Just tips for next time. Otherwise, this was
very productive.

NO ACTION TAKEN.

Adjournment: The meeting was adjourned at 11:17 P.M.

Mayor Burt: Good night all.
