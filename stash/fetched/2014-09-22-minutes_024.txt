Vice Mayor Kniss stated the complexity of the permitting process was
stunning. She was concerned about the funding.

MOTION: Vice Mayor Kniss moved, seconded by Council Member Scharff
to:
1.  Reject all construction bids received on April 15, 2014 for construction
    of the Palo Alto Municipal Golf Course Reconfiguration Project
    (Project), Capital Improvement Program Project PG-13003;

2.   Direct staff to re-advertise the Project for competitive bids, with timing
     contingent on securing the regulatory permits needed for the Project;
     and

3.   Adopt the attached Budget Amendment Ordinance (BAO) (Attachment
     A) amending the Community Services Department operating budget in
     the amount of $708,495 in revenues and $168,036 in expenses to
     fund operation of the Golf Course from September 1, 2014 to February
     28, 2015 and establish an FY 2016 Golf Course Operating Loss Reserve
     in the General Fund in the amount of $540,459.

Vice Mayor Kniss felt editorial comments could provide some assistance.
She asked if the delay occurred at the Regional Water Board.

Mr. Keene replied yes.

Vice Mayor Kniss was puzzled by the lack of understanding or coordination.

Council Member Scharff understood the JPA Project could not proceed if
State funding was lost.

Mr. Materman advised that the JPA Project as designed could not proceed
without State funding.

Council Member Scharff asked if the JPA had to begin construction or expend
funds by a certain date in 2016.

Mr. Materman reported the JPA had to expend funds by December 2016 and
could seek reimbursement in 2017, unless the JPA received an extension.

Council Member Scharff inquired whether Staff had performed outreach to all
people affected by the project.

Mr. Teresi coordinated a large group of residents, City Managers, engineers,
elected officials, and high-level managers to attend a Water Board workshop
                                                                         Page 24 of 31
