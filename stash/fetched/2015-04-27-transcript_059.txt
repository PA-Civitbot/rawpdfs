                         TRANSCRIPT
an opportunity to wade in on the Goals. If we have to bite the bullet and
have another meeting, I'm okay with that too.

Ms. Stump: Why don't I work with the Planning Director and figure out a
process, given what Council has said tonight, and get back to you with a
recommendation?

Mayor Holman: That sounds good.

Council Member Wolbach: I agree that we should have this discussion in
public. I'm okay with doing it tonight, especially if we're quick or at least
starting it. If we feel it needs to be continued and picked up further in the
future, then we do that. Iâ€™m fine with having a short discussion tonight
though.

Mayor Holman: I can't imagine there's any way it's going to be a short
discussion. It's ten to 11:00. If we could make it a short discussion, Council
Member Wolbach, I would be all for it, but it's not going to be a short
discussion. Look how we've been two-plus hours on Vision.

Council Member Filseth: I don't think it's a short discussion either. A Study
Session is the right approach.

Mayor Holman: We can look for an additional date, depending on what kind
of input we get. They are hard to come by; the calendar is full. We will get
some push back too. Be aware of that.
