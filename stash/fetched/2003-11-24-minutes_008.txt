Council Member Freeman said a matrix would be helpful to see all the
options available. She asked that responsibility be given to someone to
verify eligibility of candidates.

Ms. Furth said it was lawful for Council Member-Elect Cordell to take office.
The issue was the ability of the City to make contracts.

Vice Mayor Beecham said the issue could be referred to the Policy and
Services Committee.

Council Member Lytle said the election was valid.    The issue was the City
had a legal problem with contracts.

Council Member Kishimoto said the conflict of interest laws were important
and were taken seriously.

Council Member Freeman asked Ms. Furth the difference between a trust and
a corporation.

Ms. Furth said a corporation was an entity chartered by the state. A trust
was an agreement between the donor and a trustee who was handed
something of value.     The trust would be managed for the benefit of
beneficiaries under a set of instructions. Stanford was a tax-exempt trust
with corporate powers.
