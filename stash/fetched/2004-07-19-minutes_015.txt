Mr. Fellman said the Saffron Club would support the entire rental. Names
had been given to them of individuals who would be interested in a portion
of the facility.

Council Member Kleinberg asked whether the Saffron Club had indicated in
the bid process they were not going to use the entire space.

Mr. Fellman said they had indicated they would not use the entire space.

Council Member Kleinberg noted the two proposals had pros and cons. She
felt a restaurant was a risky enterprise as there were a large number of
restaurants that had opened and closed in the downtown area. She said the
fitness club would fill a community need and would benefit youth with their
services.

Council Member Morton said the bids of the two candidates who desired the
same space owned by the City should be reassessed. The decision was what
would be best for the City in the long term.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION: Council Member Morton moved, seconded by
Mossar, to reject staffâ€™s recommendation and direct staff to return with a
lease for the Form Fitness Club.

Council Member Mossar said as a landlord, the City should not add another
restaurant Downtown.

Council Member Cordell said it was important that income be generated.
There was an obligation to those who live and work in the City and said she
supported the substitute motion.

Mayor Beecham said both options presented risks to the City. Staff had
been told the primary criterion was cash flow to help fund the Teen Club.
The better offer for the City, would be the Form Fitness Club, and he would
support the substitute motion.

Council Member Freeman asked about the funding for the teen programs.
She asked if the $77,000 was for the Saffron Club or for either.

Mr. Fellman said it would be for the Saffron Club.

Council Member Freeman asked what it would be for Form Fitness.

Mr. Fellman said it would be less. Form Fitness would not break even until
the seventh year.
