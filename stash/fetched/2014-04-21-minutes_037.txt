Council Member Holman asked if Council Member Scharff agreed to include
in the Motion that impacts could be eliminated or effectively mitigated.

Council Member Scharff replied no. The letter stated that certain impacts
could not be eliminated or mitigated.

AMENDMENT: Council Member Holman moved, Council Member Schmid
seconded to add in the 1st paragraph, line 3 of the letter that "impacts can
be eliminated or effectively mitigated".

Council Member Holman felt this language was a stronger position for the
City. The City expected Caltrain to make an effort to not only mitigate but
also to eliminate impacts. Where impacts could not be eliminated, the City
expected effective mitigation. In EIRs, the City often did not speak strongly
or forcefully to eliminating impacts.

Council Member Schmid recalled Council Member Price suggested traffic
impacts be more forcefully stated. Stronger wording would be more
effective in this instance.

Council Member Holman noted the change was to the first paragraph of the
letter.

Council Member Klein remarked that the proposed language               would
undermine the City's position as it was not a credible statement.

Vice Mayor Kniss and Council Member Berman left the meeting at 11:45 P.M.

AMENDMENT FAILED: 2-5 Holman, Schmid yes, Berman, Kniss absent

Mayor Shepherd asked if extending station platforms would require separate
EIRs for each platform.

Marian Lee, Caltrain explained that Caltrain performed an environmental
assessment to determine whether a project required a full EIR. Given the
location, size, and challenges of platforms, she assumed extending platforms
would need a full environmental document.

Mayor Shepherd inquired about a reason for not including platform extension
in the current EIR.
