MOTION: Council Member Beecham moved, seconded by Klein, to: 1)
Approve creation of Capital Improvement Program (CIP) Project PF-07011,
Roth Building Maintenance (Attachment A); and 2) Approve the Budget
Amendment Ordinance (BAO) in the amount of $415,000 to provide an
appropriation for CIP Project PF–07011, Roth Building Maintenance
(Attachment B).

Council Member Cordell said the Council needed to authorize the money to
get the work done.

Beth Bunnenberg, 2351 Ramona Street, said there were two basic problems;
one had to do with the roof and the other was the gutter system.

Karen Holman, 725 Homer Avenue, said PAHA had submitted its proposal
two years prior. The Council had unanimously approved PAHA’s proposal to
develop the Roth Building as a history museum. Palo Alto lacked a facility for
cultural, societal, economical, technological, and environmental education.

MOTION PASSED 7-1, Mossar no, Kishimoto absent.
