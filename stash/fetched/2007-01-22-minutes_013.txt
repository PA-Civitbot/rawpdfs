Council Member Drekmeier stated his understanding was that Title 19 did
not allow a certain amount of hazardous chemicals but only required
reporting.

Mr. Firth stated that was correct.

Council Member Drekmeier stated he noticed in the report that the City had
ten sites with bio-safety level 2 or 3 labs and asked whether bio-hazards and
genetically modified materials were covered by Title 19.

Mr. Firth stated to his knowledge they were not covered.

Council Member Drekmeier questioned whether there was anything in Title
19 about cumulative impacts.

Mr. Firth stated he did not believe so.

Council Member Drekmeier questioned how the City would go about phasing
out hazardous chemicals if that were a goal of the City.

Mr. Emslie stated the City would look at groups or types of businesses that
tended to used hazardous materials, and the City had broad discretion in
determining location and permitted uses.

Mr. Keller pointed out there were two locations in Palo Alto with Title 19
hazardous materials: CPI and the Regional Water Quality Control Plant. The
City needed to make sure that whatever regulation implemented with
respect to CPI, the City had to be careful about how the regulation affected
the Regional Water Quality Control Plan.

Council Member Mossar stated the ordinance was designed to make sure
that new projects and significantly renewed projects were compatible and
well designed.

Council Member Cordell stated staff indicated under Title 19, the facility that
housed the hazardous waste had to come up with a worst case scenario,
which resulted in notification of residents who would be impacted.

Mr. Williams stated that was correct.

Council Member Cordell questioned who came up with the worst case
scenario.

Mr. Firth explained that businesses generally hired third party consulting
firms to come up with the worst case scenario.
