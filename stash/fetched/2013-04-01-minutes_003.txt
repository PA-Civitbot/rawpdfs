2.   Selection of Candidates to be Interviewed for the Library Bond

MOTION: Council Member Kniss moved, seconded by Council Member Price
to interview all the candidates for Library Bond Oversight Committee.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION: Council Member Klein moved, seconded by Mayor
Scharff to not interview any applicant, but place on the April 8, 2013
Consent Calendar, the appointment of the five incumbents; Sandra Hirsh,
John Melton, Dena Mossar, James Schmidt, and Alice Smith.

Council Member Klein felt the five incumbents were well known citizens, and
had performed well on the Library Bond Oversight Committee. Interviewing
applicants was not an efficient use of Council time as the Library Bond
Oversight Committee was scheduled to cease work in a few years.

Council Member Kniss agreed with Council Member Klein's comments.

Donna Grider, City Clerk, suggested an item to reappoint the five
incumbents could be placed on the Consent Calendar for April 8, 2013.

Council Member Holman requested Council Members comment on having
solicited applicants and now wishing to reappoint the incumbent members.
