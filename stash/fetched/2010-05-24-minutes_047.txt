MOTION RESTATED: Council Member Shepherd moved, seconded by
Council Member Klein to: 1) Support legislation securing funding for Caltrain
Electrification; 2) Support the Peninsula Cities Consortium (PCC) Core
Message, and have the HSR Committee review the Core Message and send
comments to PCC; and 3) Clarify the language that support of SB95 or other
legislation pertaining to Caltrain electrification funding is not support of High
Speed Rail favoring a particular alignment along the Caltrain right-of-way.

Council Member Holman stated she would be supporting the Motion with the
commitment on the part of the Committee to convey to the legislature the
concerns of the environmental impacts due to the electrification project.

Vice Mayor Espinosa stated that request needed to be in the form of an
Amendment to the Motion on the table or as a separate Motion.

Council Member Holman stated her understanding was the Committee was in
contact with the legislature and she felt as part of their communication the
concerns could be conveyed.

Council Member Klein stated the language appeared to be similar to the
failed Amendment and he felt uncomfortable considering language that was
inconsistent with the Motion.

MOTION PASSED: 7-1 Schmid no, Burt absent
