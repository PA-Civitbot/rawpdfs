“substantially” before the word “greater public benefit” in the fourth
sentence.

Council Member Lytle said the National Standards were substantially
stricter than the Council might think.

MOTION PASSED 7-0, Morton, Mossar “not participating.”

Council Member Freeman asked staff what the possibility was of
including the opportunity of making Homer and Channing Avenues
two-ways in the ordinance. The Council passed the Homer Avenue
undercrossing, which had a great affect on the area. Action by the
Council would be a completion of the area without having to bring it
back.

Mr. Emslie did not believe staff was able to bring back a resolution by
the time the ordinance came back. The study took longer than the
drafting period.

Council Member Freeman asked about the drafting period.

Mr. Emslie responded the drafting period was mid- to late October.

Council Member Freeman asked whether there was a date certain that
addressed the issue.

Ms. Furth said the Council’s decision on what to do on the streets did
not have to be in the ordinance.

MOTION: Council Member Freeman moved, seconded by Lytle, that
staff return with a timeframe when the Council will address the two-
way direction on Homer and Channing Avenues.

Council Member Lytle said the Council needed to move forward with
the conversion to a regular residential street and not reinforce the
commute speeds through a residential area. A timeframe to get the
work done was important.

Vice Mayor Beecham said the motion was for Homer and Channing
Avenues within SOFA 2. A motion by Council Member Freeman, who
lived on Channing would not include Channing Avenue within 500 feet
of Council Member Freeman’s residence in terms of conflict of interest.
