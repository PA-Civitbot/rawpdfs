noted in previous correspondence to EPA, the legislative history of CAA § 129 is silent as to both POTWs and
SSIs. See Attachment A.




                                                                                                                       Attachment: PA Comments EPA HQ-OAR-2009-0559_Final (1297 : EPA Proposed Rule on Sewage Sludge Incinerators)
        Further demonstrating Congress’ clear direction, EPA has already regulated SSIs as intended under
CAA § 112 by identifying SSIs as an area source category under this section. EPA examined the issue of the CAA
regulation of SSIs in 1992, when it issued its initial list of major and area source categories under § 112. See 57
Fed. Reg. 31576 (July 16, 1992). That initial list included SSIs as a § 112 source category. In this notice EPA
expressly states “the Agency does not consider sewage sludge incineration units to be covered under § 129 so it
has authority to list and set standards for these units under § 112.” See also 58 Fed. Reg. 9248, 9262, 9276-77
(Feb. 19, 1993) (noting that SSIs are regulated under § 112 of the CAA).

         In 1999, EPA promulgated a NESHAP under § 112 for POTW treatment plants. See 64 Fed. Reg. 57572
(Oct. 26, 1999). Significantly, while the definition of “POTW treatment plant” is appropriately focused on the
treatment part of a POTW, the definition of POTW in that rule is much broader and encompasses everything
that is eligible to receive grant assistance under Title II of the CWA. See 40 CFR § 63.1595. While EPA’s
rulemaking preamble inexplicably stated that EPA then believed that SSIs were subject to regulation under CAA
§ 129, EPA nowhere elaborated on the rationale for this change from its prior approach or justified this new
interpretation of the statute. See 62 Fed. Reg. 1868 (Jan. 14 1997).

        NACWA has previously raised this issue with EPA, including in the September 2009 correspondence
mentioned in the preamble to the Proposed Rule. See Attachment A. Now EPA claims that it “has taken the
position in its regulation of POTWs under the CAA that § 112(e)(5) does not apply to SSI units and for this
reason did not regulate them in its POTW § 112(d) emission standards.” 75 Fed. Reg. at 63264. Yet EPA still
offers nothing but this bare statement to justify its interpretation. EPA does not explain how it reaches the
conclusion that SSIs are not covered by the expansive CWA definition of “treatment works” incorporated into
CAA § 112(e)(5), how its interpretation is possible in light of the integral role SSIs play in the management of
sewage sludge, or how SSIs could have been built and improved using CWA Title II funds if they are not part of
the CWA definition of “treatment works.”

        Further, EPA also fails to recognize its own contrary statements and actions. In fact, shortly after EPA
promulgated the POTW NESHAP, EPA reversed its position and expressly stated that SSIs would be regulated
under § 112 instead of §129. See Unified Agenda 65 Fed. Reg. 23459-01 (Apr. 24, 2000). Then, in February 2002,
EPA revised its list of source categories under § 112 to delete SSIs, not because they were not covered by § 112,
but because there were no major sources in that category. See 67 Fed. Reg. 6521 (Feb. 12, 2002). EPA then added
SSIs to the list of area source categories under §§ 112(c) and 112(k) of the CAA. See 67 Fed. Reg. 43112 (Jun. 26,
2002); 67 Fed. Reg. 70427 (Nov. 22, 2002). SSIs remain on EPA’s current list of area source categories. See
http://www.epa.gov/ttn/atw/area/70list.pdf (last visited Nov. 29, 2010).

        CAA § 129(h)(2) states that: “no solid waste incineration units subject to performance standards under
[§§ 129 and 111] shall be subject to standards under [§ 112(d)].” Thus, the language of CAA § 129(h) makes
clear that EPA’s regulation of sources under CAA § 129 or CAA § 112 is mutually exclusive. EPA has
consistently recognized that sources regulated under CAA § 112 cannot also be regulated under CAA § 129.
Since area source categories are subject to the promulgation of emission standards under CAA § 112(d), SSIs
cannot also be regulated under CAA § 129. As the D.C. Circuit directed EPA in NRDC v. EPA, 489 F.3d 1250
