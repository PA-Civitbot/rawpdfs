MOTION: Council Member Burt moved, seconded by Council Member Barton
to approve the draft Negative Declaration and the proposed Ordinance
amending Chapter 18.28 of the City of Palo Alto Municipal Code.

Council Member Burt stated his overall support of the Motion. He stated the
proposed OS Zone District Ordinance contained several trade-offs. The
preceding Ordinance was problematic because it was a one-size-fits-all
Ordinance. He felt the proposed OS Zone District Ordinance was a good
compromise that addressed concerns from Staff, P&TC, and residents. He
indicated it would provide property owners with latitude. He spoke on the
proposed OS Zone District Ordinanceâ€™s bonus that would encourage a
greater amount of natural vegetation.

Council Member Barton addressed his concern of comparing R-1 zoned
parcels and OS Zone District parcels. He felt they should not be compared
because they were intended for different purposes.

AMENDMENT: Vice Mayor Morton moved, seconded by Mayor Drekmeier
that a second dwelling would be permitted only if the minimum lot size is ten
(10) acres or greater.
