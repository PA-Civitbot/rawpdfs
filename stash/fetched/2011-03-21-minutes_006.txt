COUNCIL MEMBER QUESTIONS, COMMENTS, AND ANNOUNCEMENTS

Council Member Shepherd inquired whether the Downtown Parking Study
would include other impacted neighborhoods.

Director of Planning and Community Environment, Curtis Williams stated
yes. The six month analysis would look at areas around downtown, and
would include permit parking programs and additional parking areas.

Council Member Holman asked if the Downtown Parking Study would include
the South of Palo Alto Area (SOFA).

Mr. Williams stated yes.

Council Member Holman inquired on a meeting this past week, where the
topic centered around the proposed AT&T cell site.

Mr. Williams stated there was an internal Staff meeting held last week.

Council Member Klein reported on attending the Bay Area Water Supply and
Conservation Agency (BAWSCA) meeting last week. The precipitation in the
Hetch Hetchy catch basin was 159 percent of normal as of last week. The
Audit, with the City of San Francisco, had been resolved for Fiscal Year
2007/2008 and the City received a $120,000 credit. BAWSCA’s budget, for
Fiscal Year 2011/2012, would show no increase in Staff which meant the
City’s contribution would be flat.

Mayor Espinosa advised that the City continued to monitor water levels in
City creeks. He spoke on the Youth Community Services organization and
the 8th Annual Family Service Day scheduled on April 2.

ADJOURNMENT: The meeting was adjourned at 11:37 p.m.
