Council Member Wolbach: My next one is—I think it relates to how we
provide for our safety in the City. I'd suggest adding whether in the Vision
Statement or a goal to have the Safety Element reflect Palo Alto's priority of
protecting and respecting civil liberties, civil rights and privacy.

Mayor Holman: Vice Mayor Schmid?

Vice Mayor Schmid: Is that part of the Vision Statement for the element?

Council Member Wolbach: At this point, I will leave it to Staff and CAC to
consider whether they feel it's appropriate to put it in the vision or the goals.

Vice Mayor Schmid: That's fine.

Mayor Holman: As well. Did you have another?

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to add to the Motion, “the Safety Element should
reflect protection and respect for civil rights, civil liberties, and privacy.”

Council Member Wolbach: Yeah. Also emphasize the importance of safe
and secure water supply for the community.

Mayor Holman: Vice Mayor, accept that?

Vice Mayor Schmid: Yes.

Mayor Holman: Likewise.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to add to the Motion, “emphasize a safe and
secure water supply.”

Council Member Wolbach:      My last one is to incorporate safety from
dangerous threats as a result of climate change such as but not limited to
flooding and fire risk.

Mayor Holman: I think we already included that in the last round, but we
can add it again.

Council Member Wolbach: This is one that I thought should be included in
both elements.

Mayor Holman: Vice Mayor Schmid?

Vice Mayor Schmid: Okay.
