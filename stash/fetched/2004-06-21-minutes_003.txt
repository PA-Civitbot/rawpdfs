STUDY SESSION

1.   Emergency Preparedness

Staff provided an update on Emergency Preparedness activities during the
last year using the new governance model. Staff described how the Steering
Committee and Working groups operate; provided a summary of the
accomplishments of the last year, including training, equipment
purchases, assertiveness in pursuing alternative funding sources, and
participation in regional activities. While much has been accomplished,
there was still more work planned especially in the areas of training,
including training for City Council Members, and the Standby Emergency
Council Members. The emphasis during the past year had been on
terrorism, but the plan for the coming year was to hold an earthquake
exercise that would include assistance from the Palo Alto Unified School
District (PAUSD).

No action required.

ADJOURNMENT: The meeting adjourned at 6:55 p.m.
