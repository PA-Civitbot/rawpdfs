AMENDMENT FAILED: 3-5 Berman, Scharff, Wolbach no, Kniss absent

Mayor Holman: We return to the main Motion. I have just one thing, to add
to expand Natural Resources Conservation as one of the categories to
include open space and habitat.

Council Member DuBois: I'd accept that.

Council Member Scharff: No, I don't.

Mayor Holman: Seriously?

Council Member Scharff: Seriously.

Council Member DuBois: I'll second it.

Mayor Holman: Moved and seconded by Council Member DuBois to expand
Natural Resources Conservation to include open space and habitat.

AMENDMENT: Mayor Holman moved, seconded by Council Member DuBois
to add to the Motion, “expand Natural Resources Conservation category to
include expertise in open space and habitat.”

Council Member Scharff: You're saying that's not in the Comp Plan, that
category does not include these things already? That's what you're saying?
I find that hard to believe.

Mayor Holman: All of this stuff is in the Comp Plan. We're clarifying.

Council Member DuBois: Mayor Holman, I thought you were proposing that
a member of the committee have that expertise.

Mayor Holman: Yes.

Council Member DuBois:      Would you say "expertise in open space and
habitat"?

Mayor Holman: Sure, that's fine. That's what the list is, that I'm referring
to.

Council Member Wolbach: I'm trying to be sure I understand what you're
talking about being expanded. Does that mean we're talking about ...

Mayor Holman: The list on page 838 is that list of representatives.

Council Member Wolbach:      You're looking at page 4, 838 of the packet.
Thanks.
