visibility at that location. Part of it is tree blockage and all those things.
There are tradeoffs like we have any time. It's a discussion that, I think, we
should have. Finally, when we talk about PCs and the failure of PCs, it's
important to remember that—if we look at the PCs in our community, they're
not just the failures.      Certainly, our affordable housing projects are
overwhelmingly PCs. We would have almost no affordable housing in this
community without PCs. Neighborhood shopping centers are generally PCs,
and we're very limited on ability to create this. Without a PC, I don't know
how we would have retained a neighborhood shopping center there albeit
this one is vacant. Without the PC, I don't know that we'd have one. We
need to think about when we see a failure PC and say, "Throw the whole
thing out. They're a total failure," we're only focusing on the places they've
failed and not where they have had significant community benefit for
decades. We clearly need to fix them, but I'm not sure abolishing them is
the right fix. Having said that, I think we're ready to vote.
