Council Member Beecham concurred with the new language.

Council Member Kishimoto said one of the most important jobs of the
Council was to hire, evaluate, and terminate a CAO. She felt the 90-days
provided a cooling off period and allowed the Council to terminate a CAO
with cause at anytime.

MOTION PASSED 8-1 Freeman no.

Council Member Beecham congratulated Vice Mayor Kleinberg on being
elected the Peninsula League President, and noted the San Francisco Public
Utilities Commission (SFPUC) approved the Water System Improvement Plan
(WSIP), which committed $4.3 billion to upgrade the Hetch-Hetchy water
system over the next ten years to make it reliable for seismic issues,
drought and overall supply.
