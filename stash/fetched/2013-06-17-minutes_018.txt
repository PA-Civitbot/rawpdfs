Council Member Price did not believe senior affordable housing residents
were unlikely to own electric vehicles; however, the charging stations were
appropriate as a benefit for the community.

MOTION AS AMENDED PASSED: 9-0

MOTION: Council Member Burt moved, seconded by Council Member
Berman to direct Staff to commence a traffic calming and pedestrian safety
evaluation for Maybell Avenue that would go to the Planning and
Transportation Commission prior to returning to Council for consideration.

Mayor Scharff noted Vice Mayor Shepherd inquired whether the Motion
included review of the Arastradero Road project.

Council Member Burt answered no. He wanted to focus on Maybell Avenue
to address the neighborhood's concerns.

Council Member Berman concurred.

Council took a five minute break at 10:38 P.M. and returned at 10:43 P.M.

Council Member Klein inquired about the difference between Staff's current
traffic project and the Motion's proposed traffic project.

Mr. Aknin reported the initial outreach for the Maybell Bicycle Boulevard
would be sent to the community. Staff had not scheduled a meeting with
the Planning and Transportation Commission, but could do so.

Council Member Klein asked if the Motion would expand the bike study to
include other forms of transportation.

Mr. Aknin responded yes. Staff would look at other forms of transportation
as part of the study.

Council Member Klein inquired whether the Motion would fold the existing
program into the Motion's proposed project.

Council Member Burt replied yes. A second purpose of the Motion was to
demonstrate the Council's commitment to the community.
