Council Member Burt asked if the Agenda Item would allow discussion of
improving or modifying existing enforcement regulations.

Ms. Stump answered no.       Enforcement was related to unlawful conduct
rather than homelessness.

Council Member Burt asked if vehicle dwelling would be acceptable for both
support and enforcement programs.

Ms. Stump inquired whether Council Member Burt wished to discuss vehicle
dwelling.

Council Member Burt understood vehicle dwelling was going to be the
primary focus of the Agenda Item.

Mr. Keene believed vehicle dwelling should be included.

Ms. Stump preferred the term vehicle dwelling to the term homelessness,
and recommended substituting the terms.

Council Member Burt inquired whether the Council could discuss social
service initiatives to support needs as well as potential ways to support
neighborhoods under the Agenda Item.

Ms. Stump replied yes.

Council Member Price felt the earlier statement was more global and would
allow more discussion.

Mr. Keene understood the Council's intent was to allow a discussion of issues
pertaining to vehicle dwelling, homelessness, and related services.

Council Member Schmid noted homelessness was in both his and Council
Member Price's original comments.

Ms. Stump suggested substituting vehicle dwelling for homelessness because
of Council Member Burt's interest in quality of life, criminal enforcement.
Enforcement was not and should not be directly related to homelessness.
She asked if Council Member Schmid wanted to discuss other types of social
services related to community people without homes.

Mr. Keene suggested "county services and related homeless services."

Council Member Schmid reiterated that both Council Member Price and he
specifically stated homelessness.
