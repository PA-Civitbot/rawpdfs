8.    Policy and Services Committee Recommendations for Approval of
      Updated Below Market Rate (BMR) Program

Director of Planning and Community Environment Steve Emslie presented a
brief overview of the BMR program under the recently completed study.

Planning & Transportation Commissioner Paula Sandas discussed the
retroactive Consumer Price Index (CPI).

Planning Manager Cathy Siegel explained the CPI process as the most
commonly used measure of inflation in prices for consumer goods including
housing costs. The term one-third CPI refers to one-third of the percentage
change in the CPI over a period in time. When the rate of inflation is stated,
it is stated as a percentage change over a specific period. For example, the
Bay Area inflation for the year 2007 was 3.3%, which means the CPI Index
increased over the calendar year by 3.3%. One-third of the full CPI increase
is thus 1.1%.

Council Member Barton asked why the CPI model was being utilized instead
of the Area Median Income (AMI) model as is with most surrounding Cities.

Mr. Emslie stated the CPI model was more stable.

Council Member Barton stated the CPI model had inflation influxes influx.

Mr. Emslie stated the history of both programs showed CPI being more
stable than the AMI.

Council Member Barton stated with the variability in the AMI, the stability
should be built into the system. He stated the primary goal was to maintain
affordability within a particular group with allowable flexibility.

Mr. Emslie stated there were pros and cons to using both methods.

Council Member Burt stated based on the formula staff had proposed, it
seemed the income group had been altered from the original intent.
