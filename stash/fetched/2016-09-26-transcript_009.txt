MOTION FOR AGENDA ITEM NUMBER 5 PASSED: 8-1 Filseth, no

MOTION FOR AGENDA ITEM NUMBERS 4, 6-7 PASSED: 9-0

Mayor Burt:   Council Member Filseth, you're welcome to speak to your no
vote.

Council Member Filseth: Just very briefly, it looks like—I apologize for not
having asked this in advance. It looks to me like it's about $500,000 of City
money to subsidize outreach, marketing and buying LED light bulbs for two
areas. One is a medical center expansion, which I assume is the Stanford
Med Center, and the other is multiunit apartment complexes. I think I would
feel differently if it were limited to below market rate housing or Palo Alto
Housing Corporation housing, but it looks like anybody. I think those folks
should buy their own LED light bulbs. I don't think the City should buy them
for them. Thank you.

Mayor Burt: Thank you.
