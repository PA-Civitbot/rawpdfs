                      FINAL MINUTES
John Fredrich spoke regarding Agenda Item Number 2. While the amount of
the contract was small in comparison to many contracts, the funds could be
better spent. Outsourcing a job did not increase Staff capacity. The
contract defeated the purpose of the scope of services.

Sea Reddy spoke regarding Agenda Item Number 2. The money for the
contract should be donated to the Ebola crisis. The services outlined in the
contract were not needed.

Stephanie Munoz spoke regarding Agenda Item Number 3.                 It was
counterproductive for the water utility to force residents to retain a larger
meter in times of drought.      The Council should review Water Utility
operations.
