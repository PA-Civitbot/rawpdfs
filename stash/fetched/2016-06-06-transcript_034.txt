Council Member DuBois: My comment is I'm concerned about the lack of
CEQA review and public participation.

Mayor Burt: Council Member Holman.

Council Member Holman: I'm sorry. I do have one more question. When
we get to motions, we're not looking for exact language; we're just looking
for what we want the letter to include or not. I just want to be clear on that.

Mayor Burt:    I think that'd be correct.   It'd be with adequate clarity that

Council Member Holman: Thank you.

Mayor Burt: ... understands it. Council Member Wolbach.

Council Member Wolbach: I actually realized I did have one question.

Council Member Wolbach:       Thank you.    We just got it, so I was trying to
read it fast. Thank you.

Mayor Burt: We have two members of public who wish to speak. Our first
speaker is Stephanie Munoz, to be followed by Bob Moss. Welcome.

Stephanie Munoz: Good evening, Mayor Burt and Council Members. I'd like
to speak to this and suggest to you that you also want what the Governor
and the Legislature wants. You should be thinking very seriously. You have
a member who's running for Assembly and a concerned citizen in this very
