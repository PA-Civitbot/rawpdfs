                        The City Council will not take action on the night that a
                        colleague memo is introduced if it has any implications for
                        staff resources or current work priorities which are not
                        addressed in the memo. The Council will discuss the
                        colleague memo and then direct the City Manager to
                        agendize the matter for Council action within two
                        meetings, allowing City staff time to prepare a summary of
                        staffing and resource impacts. Action may be taken
                        immediately by the Council on colleague memos where
                        there are no resource or staffing implications or where
                        these are fully outlined in the colleagues memo.       The
                        Brown Act requires that the public be fully informed of the
                        potential action by the Council via the Agenda 72 hours




                                                                                                     Attachment: 2.15.11 (1422 : Policy and Services Agenda 2/15/2011)
                        before a scheduled Council meeting. In order to satisfy the
                        Brown Act requirements, the Council should consult with
                        the City Attorney to ensure that the proposed title to the
                        colleague memo contains all actions that the Council
                        Members want completed on the night of the Council
                        review.

                    9) Council         member      Questions,     Comments       and
                    Announcements. The purpose of this agenda item is to allow
                    Council to question staff briefly on matters upon which Council
                    has taken action or given direction, make general comments as a
                    reference to staff on factual matters of community concern, or
                    make brief announcements in a manner consistent with
                    Government Code section 54952.2. New assignments will not
                    be given nor will major policy issues be discussed or
                    considered. To the extent possible, Council will confer with
                    staff before raising matters under this agenda item. This agenda
                    item will generally be limited to 15 minutes in length and the
                    public may not speak to matters discussed;

                    10) Closed Sessions;

                    11) Special closed sessions will be scheduled before or after
                    regular or special Council meetings to the extent possible and
                    appropriate. Closed sessions may be scheduled during a regular
                    or special Council meeting, but this is discouraged by Council;

                    12) Adjournment.

                 d) Unfinished and Continued Business. When the Council is unable
                 to complete its agenda the remaining business will generally be
