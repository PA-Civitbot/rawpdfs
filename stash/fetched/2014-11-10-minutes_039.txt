Council Member Burt believed metrics flowed from well-defined objectives.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND to add “well-defined objectives and metrics” after “… request
is to contain the appropriate”.

Council Member Burt felt Staff had provided a decent explanation for the
concept; however, the proposal did not contain sufficient information
regarding work resulting from the project.    The Palo Alto community
expected and needed more and better engagement than the average
community. Engagement was two-way and meaningful dialog. He believed
that was the intent of the proposal.
