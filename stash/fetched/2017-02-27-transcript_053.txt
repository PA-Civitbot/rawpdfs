Council Member Kou: I did send a note to our Assistant City Manager to ask
to have Agenda Item 8 pulled from the Consent Calendar. May I say why or
how does that work?

Mayor Scharff: You just ask to pull it; you don't say anything further. You
need to get two Council Members.

MOTION:     Council Member Kou moved, seconded by Council Member
Holman, third by Council Member DuBois to pull Agenda Item Number 8 -

Mayor Scharff: The item is pulled from Consent and will be rescheduled to a

Calendar, we need a Motion to approve.
