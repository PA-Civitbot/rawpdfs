about the travel expenses and inquired whether the expense would be in
addition to the contract or included therein.

City Attorney Gary Baum said it would occur however the Council directed.

Council Member Morton said the Council should be made aware if the City
intended to pay significant travel expenses as opposed to hiring someone
locally.

Mr. Baum said travel expenses would be negotiated.

Mayor Kleinberg clarified it would be a one year experiment.

Council Member Barton recalled the OIR Group did not represent an ongoing
relationship with the City Attorney’s Office in Oakland. He believed they were
doing work on a regular basis with the special assistant to Judge Felton
Henderson, who was located in San Francisco.

MOTION PASSED 9-0.

Mr. Baum said the City’s Attorney’s Office would put together a contract and
bring it to Council before the summer break. He inquired whether the
Council preferred negotiations on the travel issue.

Council Member Cordell said the OIR Group had presented a maximum
amount of approximately $20,000.

Mayor Kleinberg asked whether the other applicants would be contacted.

Mr. Baum said his office would take care of it.

Mayor Kleinberg said that would be great.
