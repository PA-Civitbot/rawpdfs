Mr. Fellman confirmed the Council had approved the eligibility categories.

Council Member Kleinberg said the eligibility categories had been approved
in 2001, not the criteria. She asked whether there was prohibition against
sub-leasing.

Mr. Fellman said there was no prohibition.

Council Member Kleinberg asked whether either proposal planned to sub-
lease.

Mr. Fellman said the Saffron Club planned to sub-lease.

Council Member Kleinberg asked how much they planned to sub-lease. She
also asked whether the City staff took into account who the sub-lessees
were and how much of the rent would be contingent on financially
competence and sustainable sub-leases.

Mr. Fellman said the Saffron Club had assumed all the rent responsibilities.

Council Member Kleinberg asked whether the associated sub-lease numbers
had been reviewed by City staff.

Mr. Fellman said the sub-lease numbers would be looked at when the sub-
tenants were approved.

Council Member Kleinberg said the numbers were based on an assumption
that the main lessee would be sub-leasing to substantial sub-lessees to meet
the financial goals.

Mr. Fellman said it was based on the Saffron Club paying the rent for the
entire facility.

Council Member Kleinberg said legally it was known who was responsible,
but economically and financially it was not known where the money would
come from.

Mr. Fellman said it was known. He noted those who proposed for partial
leasing of the facility would have been approved on an individual basis. The
names had been given to the Saffron Club.

Council Member Kleinberg asked whether the Saffron Club knew in advance
they would not be able to support the entire lease amount.
