1.   Resolution 8400 entitled “Resolution of the Council of the City of Palo
     Alto Expressing Appreciation to Paul Thiltgen for Outstanding Public
     Service to the City of Palo Alto”

MOTION: Council Member Morton moved, seconded by Ojakian, to adopt
the resolution.

Council Member Morton said Paul Thiltgen had blessed Palo Alto with 20-plus
years of incredible growth in community programs. Mr. Thiltgen gave City
staff the chance to meet repeated challenges and the opportunity to
succeed. He was saddened to see the City lose such a special resource.

Council Member Ojakian thanked Paul Thiltgen for his efforts in renovating
the City parks, his ability to get things done, and his sense of humor.

MOTION PASSED 9-0.

Paul Thiltgen said in December 2003, the Council recognized Del Thorpe who
served the City for 38 years. He felt it was important that a person who had
committed so much time to the City, and who had fostered the Cubberley
Community Center through its growth and improvements should have the
opportunity to be recognized.

Del Thorpe expressed appreciation for the many opportunities he had during
his 38 years with the City.

Mr. Thiltgen expressed appreciation to his parents for the foundation they
established. He enjoyed the staff he had worked with, and their commitment
to serving the City and citizens of Palo Alto. He thanked the many volunteers
who helped make community services so successful.

Vice Mayor Burch expressed appreciation to Maureen Thiltgen for the love
and support of her husband.
