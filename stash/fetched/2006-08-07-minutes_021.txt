Council Member Cordell expressed concern about other options should staff’s
progress fall short.

Mr. Emslie said staff had already begun contacting the owners and initiating
discussions. He suggested returning to Council with a status report prior to
November 7 if acceptable options had not been reached.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to remove Fry’s from the list, leaving the last
three properties on the list, since staff was directed to work further with
Fry’s.

Vice Mayor Kishimoto asked whether there would be a specific commercial
zoning designation.

Council Member Klein said he would leave that for staff’s recommendation.

Vice Mayor Kishimoto said while she expressed support for the motion, the
Council was open to listening to the community’s input.

Council Member Mossar clarified Palo Alto currently allowed housing in areas
zoned commercial.

Mr. Emslie said that was correct.

Council Member Mossar asked whether housing could be built if the three
sites were changed to commercial use.

Mr. Emslie said no. The first part of the motion was to eliminate or restrict
housing from commercial zones. Restricted housing would be limited to
mixed-use with ground floor retail. Staff was on track to have the latter in
place before November 7.

Council Member Morton clarified Council’s direction to staff was to find a way
to preserve Fry’s and asked that it be included in Option A1.

Mr. Emslie said Council’s direction was to preserve commercial and retail
uses in that area and it would be possible to include the site in Option A1.

Council Member Morton clarified by removing the Fry’s site from the motion
did not negate the possibility of modifying zoning to eliminate housing in
commercial zones.

Mr. Emslie said that was correct.
