Mayor Drekmeier said Council Member Barton commented that 50 building
Green points was not challenging. The City was at 70 points and asked if it
had changed.

Mr. Williams explained there was only one category and a sub-category that
had 50 points for additions on multi-family. It was at 70 points and
increased depending on the size of the house. The baseline was for 2,550
square feet and for every 70 square feet above that required 1 point.

Ms. Heinen said most projects were beyond the minimum requirement. The
Build It Green rating had updated itself from 77 points to 70 points and
became less stringent. The decision was to maintain that rate because
buildings were performing higher and Build It Green was set on
recommendations of not going above the 50 points.

Mayor Drekmeier asked what the average points were for new construction.

Ms. Heinen said she could not give a definite answer but found homes
coming in well over 100 points.

Council Member Barton left the meeting at 12:05 a.m.
