Vice Mayor Schmid:      Yes, it's on page 19 under Goal T-1, sustainable
transportation.

Mayor Holman: Where are you wanting to insert?

Vice Mayor Schmid:        Emphasizes walking, bicycling,        use    of    public
transportation in mixed use zoning and other methods.

Mayor Holman: Council Member DuBois, are you accepting that?

Council Member DuBois: It feels like it belongs in the Housing Element. I'm
just not sure.

Vice Mayor Schmid: The programs and policies under there include things
like housing near employment centers, housing near stations.

Council Member DuBois: I'm sorry, say that again. What includes that?

Vice Mayor Schmid: The policies and programs under Goal T-1.

Council Member DuBois: I guess if they're in the policies, I'll accept it.

Mayor Holman: Council Member Scharff?

Council Member Scharff: We're talking about putting the words "mixed use"
...

Vice Mayor Schmid: Zoning.

Council Member Scharff: Mixed use zoning. Have we ever put something

place to put this stuff, I'd (inaudible) but it feels wrong. It just feels
intuitively wrong to me.

Ms. Gitelman: I mean, there is a nexus. I guess we could work with the
wording a little. Having a mix of uses tends to reduce car trips because
they're more link trips.

Council Member Scharff: That's true.

Ms. Gitelman: I think if you could give us the direction, we'll find a way to
make it—I wouldn't say maybe zoning, but a mix of uses does encourage
(crosstalk).
