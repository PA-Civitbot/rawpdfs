SUBSTITUTE MOTION: Council Member Klein moved, seconded by Morton,
to hear agenda Item 9A (old Item 4) at this point in the agenda.

MOTION PASSED 9-0.

9a.   (Old Item 4.) Request by Greenbriar Homes Communities, Inc. and
      McNellis Partners for Approval of City Council to Conduct a Preliminary
      Review of a Mixed-Use Residential and Retail Development at 3401,
      3415 and 3445 Alma Street (Alma Plaza) [05-PLN-00416]

Sheri Furman, 3094 Greer Road, suggested the item was a major land use
issue better studied first by the Planning and Transportation Commission.
The Council was urged to consider requiring the entire area to be ground
floor retail with housing above the retail.

Arthur Keller, 3881 Corina Way, spoke on the importance of retaining Alma
Plaza as neighborhood-serving retail.

Bob Moss, 4010 Orme Street, spoke about the importance of getting retail in
a viable center in Alma Plaza and recommended the option to have the
Planning and Transportation Commission and City Council to fully discuss the
issue.

Jim Baer, 172 University Avenue, spoke in favor of orderly, extensive,
organized outreach.

Council Member Klein clarified the item would be a study session.

Director of Planning and Community Environment Steve Emslie said that was
correct.

City Manager Frank Benest said the study session was currently set for one
and one half hours, but the Council could set however much time it wished.
The Council could share values and perspectives so that the developer could
proceed in developing an application responsive to the interests of the City.

Council Member Klein clarified the Planning and Transportation Commission
(P&TC) would not take action but would only hear individual Commission
memberâ€™s comments.

Mr. Benest said that was correct.
