Mayor Scharff asked if Staff had comments.

Mike Nafziger, Senior Engineer, indicated the at-places memorandum
described changes to the estimated assessment roll which occurred between
publication of the Council packet for the June 10, 2013 meeting and the
beginning of the current meeting. The adjustments resulted from a data
input error and the addition of a recently completed commercial parcel
within the Assessment District. The net effect of the corrections was a
decrease in the estimated assessment for one parcel affected by the input
error and a nominal increase in the other District parcels in the range of
$0.30-$150.00.
