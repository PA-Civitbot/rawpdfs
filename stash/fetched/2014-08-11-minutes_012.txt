Council Member Scharff would not support the Motion. The Agenda for the
August 18, 2014 meeting was full. Satellite parking was an independent
issue. The public was present for the discussion.

Council Member     Berman    concurred    with   Council   Member     Scharff's
comments.

Council Member Price also concurred with Council Member Scharff's
comments.

Vice Mayor Kniss felt the Council should discuss individual issues and would
not support the Motion.

Council Member Burt inquired whether the intention of the Motion was to
preclude further Council Member questions and comments or to preclude
Council action.

Council Member Klein indicated the intention was to preclude Council action.

Council Member Burt asked if Council Member Klein would continue the item
to the September meeting given Ms. Gitelman's description of the topic for
discussion.

Council Member Klein indicated the Motion would not be approved;
therefore, the Council should vote on the Motion and begin discussion of the
item.

Council Member Burt asked if Council Member Klein would continue the item
to the following week or September.

Council Member Klein preferred one meeting devoted to a variety of
solutions.

Council Member Burt reiterated his question.

Council Member Klein answered September.

Council Member Burt believed action on the item was contingent upon other
considerations. The item was more contentious than other actions. The
Council should discuss it at the current time and then defer it to the
September meeting for action.
