Mr. Keene repeated that everything was thrown together and labeled
backlog. He indicated the need for a Public Safety Building wasn't treated as
a new and replacement item, it was in backlog just as other items were. He
thought it was more about establishing the new vernacular based on the
IBRC's work.

Council Member Burt inquired if keep-up were pulled out from backlog, then
they were looking at approximately $250 million in backlog including new
and replacement.

Mr. Bobel stated that would be a better way to use the word backlog.

Council Member Burt wanted to emphasize that, because this other number
had been floating out for a long period of time. He stated the Council would
need to recalibrate and educate the community and press that the IBRC had
more effectively defined backlog, such that there were discrete elements
comprising the total and they could be separated.

Mr. Keene restated that the difference wasn't a change in the amount of
work that needed to be done over the 25-year period, rather the IBRC had
focused on where new funding sources needed to be found knowing there
were annual commitments to Infrastructure.      He explained the Street
Maintenance Program had doubled in the last couple of years and was now
included in the current numbers in the Long Range Forecast and in these
projections.

Council Member Klein recalled that the Public Safety Building was never
included in the $500 million backlog.

Mr. Perez indicated $60 million was the figure.

Council Member Klein stated that was not included in the $500 million.

Mr. Perez said it was.

Council Member Klein asked if it was included.

Mr. Perez replied yes, on page 276. He noted Council Members didn't have
that information. He stated it included items such as the MSC, Fire Stations
3 and 4, Animal Shelter, Junior Museum.
