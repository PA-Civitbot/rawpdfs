Oral Communications

Lynn Huidekoper thanked the Council for rescinding the Living in Vehicles
Ordinance. The City needed a plan for vehicle dwellers to park in the
community and not be cited. One vehicle dweller was parking in a church
parking lot with permission.

Roberta Alquist hoped the City would promote low-income housing and play
a role in building housing. The City should provide opportunities for more
low-income housing and a rent stabilization program in order to promote a
diverse community.

Herb Borock read comments made by Richard Hackmann, City of Palo Alto,
and David Schonbrunn, TRANSDEF, to the Caltrain Board at its January 2015
meeting to certify the Electrification Project Environmental Impact Report
(EIR). Mr. Schonbrunn's comments to challenge certification of the EIR were
consistent with Palo Alto's adopted guidelines.

Mark Weiss appreciated the Council's ability to address a wide variety of
issues. Local press was not covering Gunn High School football.

Cybele LoVuolo-Bhushan was not sure what type of program was needed for
vehicle dwellers; however, the City should retain ethnic and economic
diversity in the community.
