Ms. Hernandez advised that the Council could submit the application for MAP
funding of $150,000 and direct Staff to provide additional information on
how to spend the $150,000.

Council Member Scharff asked if the Council could refer a BAO to the Finance
Committee for review.

Ms. Hernandez indicated a BAO would not be necessary if funding remained
at $150,000. Staff would simply add a program under MAP.

Council Member Schmid recalled that CDBG funding was usually presented
with HSRAP funding. The Staff Report did not contain a comparison of FY
2014 allocations to FY 2015 allocations. He requested Staff comment on any
notable differences in allocations.

Ms. Hernandez noted the allocation for the Public Service category decreased
$8,200 in FY 2015.

Council Member Schmid inquired whether the proportionate share for each
agency would remain the same.

Ms. Hernandez stated the percentage of funding for each agency within
Public Service remained the same.

Council Member Schmid asked if any agencies also applied for HSRAP
funding.

Ms. Hernandez understood two agencies applied for both programs. The
Community Services Department (CSD) Budget contained allocations for
HSRAP.

Council Member Schmid inquired whether Staff would have a separate
presentation for HSRAP funding.

Ms. Hernandez replied no. HSRAP funding was based on a two-year cycle
and not contingent upon HUD funding.

Council Member Schmid felt the time could be appropriate for the Council to
consider an increase.

James Keene, City Manager, reported the Council had discretion to revise
funding during the Budget process.
