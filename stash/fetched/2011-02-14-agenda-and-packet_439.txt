industrial dischargers come and go. Sewage sludge constituents and concentrations vary because the discharge
to each POTW is unique. Without the use of long-term data to support the level of emission standards, this

variability makes numeric technology-based limits impractical and infeasible and should provide EPA strong
motivation to look to other regulatory options.

         POTWs also face significant regional and seasonal variability that is not captured by EPAâ€™s dataset.
Initial high flow periods in the spring often scour the sewers and dislodge heavier material that has settled in
the sewer system during low-flow periods, which often results in a spike in metals concentrations (e.g., mercury,
cadmium, lead) in the sewage sludge. The ICR stack tests in January and February that were used for the EPA
database would not have captured these events. In addition, northern cities that use salt for de-icing roadways
experience significant increases in chlorides during the winter months. High chloride concentrations are
known to improve the effectiveness of mercury control at existing wet scrubbers. See 2009 WERF Report at 2-4
(Attachment B). Stack test results during January and February in these communities may not be replicable
during other times of year.

        EPA has the data it needs to examine sludge variability for metals. Most POTWs have been required to
collect weekly sludge samples and test them for the Part 503 metals. In the Table 3 NEORSD has compiled the
monthly average sewage sludge content of cadmium, lead, and mercury at two of its facilities. Even when
averaged over an entire month, the range of average metal concentrations varies by a factor of three or more.

Data collected in January and February from these sources could not be considered representative of the sewage
sludge during other months or seasons. NACWA has every reason to believe that other POTWs face variability
at this level or greater and that this degree of variability applies to other constituents as well. EPA should
consider the Part 503 data that POTWs submit to the Agency regularly to account for variability when setting
emission limits.

      In the Proposed Rule, EPA bases its MACT floor analysis solely on a limited set of emission test data.
However, nothing in the CAA restricts EPA to emission test data when determining MACT emission rates and
