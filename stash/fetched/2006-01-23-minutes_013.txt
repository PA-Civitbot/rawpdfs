Council Member Mossar asked for clarification of whether the motion, if
passed, was Council’s approval of the item or Council’s approval to move
forward with the item.

Mr. Baum said Council’s approval of the motion would direct staff to return
with language to place the item on the November 2007 ballot. It would
require a 50 percent plus one vote unless designated as a special tax, which
increased the requirement to 66 percent.

Council Member Mossar opposed to the motion. She felt it was precipitous to
expect voter approval when there were potentially other items on the
November 2007 ballot.

Council Member Barton agreed the timing was wrong to move forward with
placing the item on the ballot. Studying the idea of increasing the TOT made
better sense.

Council Member Beecham concurred with the comments of Council Members
Mossar and Barton.

Council Member Morton encouraged his colleagues to think the matter
through before deciding to place it on the November 2007 ballot. He was
opposed to the motion.

Council Member Klein said he was not worried about having the TOT on the
November 2007 ballot when there may or may not be the bond issue. He
believed it was advantageous to show the community there was a
comprehensive infrastructure plan.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION FAILED 3-6, Cordell, Drekmeier, Klein yes.

Council Member Beecham expressed support for the original motion. There
was plenty of time between now and the November 2007 ballot. It was
important to conduct outreach to the business community to ask their
support or solicit information.

Mayor Kleinberg concurred with the comments of Council Member Beecham.

MOTION PASSED 9-0.

RECESS: 9:20 to 9:27 p.m.
