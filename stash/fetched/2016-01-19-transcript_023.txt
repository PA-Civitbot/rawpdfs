restroom." I would add "2" in as well.      Are you good with that, Council
Member Wolbach?

Council Member Wolbach: Yes. "2" gives us two different options. It's ...

Mayor Burt: He's just ...

Council Member Wolbach: Maybe we should just do it one at a time.

Mayor Burt: ... done the one, and now he's going to speak on two.

Council Member Wolbach: It wasn't clear. Thank you. Yes, on Number 1,
I'd agree to that. I'll hear your thoughts on Number 2.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to add to the Motion, “amend Section IXB of the
Lease between the City of Palo Alto and EV to release EV from the
development and construction obligations of building a public restroom in
the Baylands Parkland and authorize the City to assume and manage the
construction of the public restroom.” (New Part E)

Vice Mayor Scharff: I would go with the second option; I don't really have a
strong preference. A reduction in the payment from EV to the City for the
cost of construction of the public rooms from 75 to 35, giving them the

perfectly acceptable. I would suggest that we do that, that we lower their
obligation from 75 to 35,000.

Council Member Wolbach: I'd be fine with that as well.
