STUDY SESSION

1.   Study Session Regarding the Valley Transportation Authority's El
     Camino Real Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Project.

Staff from Valley Transportation Authority presented the El Camino - Bus
Rapid Transit (BRT) project in a Study Session to the City Council. The
proposed El Camino Real BRT Corridor extends from Downtown San Jose
(Arena Station) to Downtown Palo Alto (Palo Alto Transit Center) passing
through the cities of Santa Clara, Sunnyvale, Los Altos, and Mountain View.
The goal of the project is to improve transit access along the El Camino Real
corridor by providing faster and more reliable bus transit service with target
stops using specialized transit vehicles and enhanced station facilities. VTA
staff is recommending that the project include a combination of BRT
operations in either a “Mixed Flow Lane” or “Dedicated Center Median Lanes”
through the corridor. Mixed Flow Lane operations preserve existing lane
configurations along El Camino Real while Dedicated Center Median
operations require a reduction in lanes along El Camino Real to provided the
dedicated roadway right-of-way to sustain BRT operations. In Palo Alto, the
VTA is proposing BRT to operate within a Mixed Flow Lane operation with
stations at California Avenue and near Charleston Road-Arastradero Road
(Maybell Avenue). The City Council indicated a preference for the VTA to
                                   1                              6/20/2011
