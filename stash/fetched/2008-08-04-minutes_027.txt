about the BART extension and the carbon reduction/air pollution reduction
for BART and other small projects.

Council Member Espinosa spoke about being on the Valley Transportation
Authority (VTA) PAC and that representatives on the VTA Board think
regionally and how that manifests when it comes to representation of
smaller cities. There would need to be legislative changes in Sacramento to
change how representatives are put on the Board.

Mayor Klein reported that on August 5, 2008 at 7:00 PM there is the
unveiling of the Color of Palo Alto at City Hall. He also reported that he and
several Council Members attended the Peninsula Division of the California
League of Cities and the focus was on gangs. They also discussed the
ongoing problems with the State budget. He stated that he represented the
City at an event that the Museum of American Heritage had at Palo Alto High
School on Sunday, August 3, 2008. He also represented the City at the

of issues for the City to consider over the next year for this event to occur
and be involved in it.
