because it's being addressed in the Comprehensive Plan, so is housing. How
is it any different?

Mayor Scharff: You're asking a question of why is housing different?
Housing is different because it's an area of particular focus of where we're
talking about getting affordable housing projects and market-rate housing
projects built this year. That's why it's different. We're not talking about
doing commercial development this year.

Council Member Holman: We're talking about how much to do and what it
looks like and stuff.

Mr. Keene: You have a cap. You've adopted a cap.

Mayor Scharff: I guess we'll probably end up at 2:10 if people can tolerate
that for a little bit.

Vice Mayor Kniss: May I just explain that I had a 1:30 commitment?

Mayor Scharff: Before you go, why don't you tell us if there's anything you
want to add or anything that you want to take or anything you have an issue
with? We're going to have to limit this to really short â€¦

Vice Mayor Kniss: Of all this over here?
