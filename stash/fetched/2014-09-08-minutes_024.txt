process. It would be reviewed by all Boards and Commissions.

Council Member Scharff asked if the Council was changing the regular
process.

Mr. Keene understood the regular process would not change.

Council Member Scharff inquired whether the Motion was confirming the
regular process.

Mr. Keene replied yes.

Council Member Scharff asked why the Council did not confirm the regular
process in every Motion regarding construction projects. The Council should
follow the regular process.

Vice Mayor Kniss advised the Council should confirm the usual process in
this instance because a juried competition was not typical for construction
projects.

Council Member Scharff inquired whether including a role for the PARC and
P&TC in the Motion made any difference.

Mr. Eggleston reported based on Council comments, Staff could build in an
effort to go to those Boards and Commissions before presenting a
recommendation to the Council.

Council Member Scharff interpreted Mr. Eggleston's comment as including
the language did make a difference. He inquired whether Staff would not
have followed the usual process because it was not the regular process or
because Staff did not follow the regular process.

Mr. Eggleston stated the City did not have a regular process for a design
competition.

Council Member Scharff indicated the Motion should contain the language
because the City did not have a regular process for a design competition

Mr. Eggleston agreed with including the language in the Motion.

Council Member Scharff withdrew his second to the Amendment.
