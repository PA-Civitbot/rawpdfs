District (CC(2)), 18.45 (Service Commercial), and 18.49 (Commercial
Downtown), adding Portions of a New Chapter 18.16 (Neighborhood,
Community, and Service Commercial Districts), adding a New Chapter 18.18
(Downtown Commercial District), and Amending Section 18.94.970
(Nonconforming Uses and Noncomplying Facilities) of the Palo Alto Municipal
Code (Zoning Ordinance), and medical/dental offices would be permitted by
a Conditional Use Permit.

Council Member Cordell recommended eliminating the termination date for
the nonconforming use. The recommendation was supported by the owner of
the property.

Mr. Emslie said the understanding provided more flexibility for the future use
of the site.

Council Member Cordell asked Mr. Smithâ€™s views on the zoning changes.

Boyd Smith said this property was zoned residential and the use had
proceeded in a residential manner to date, rezoning would not affect him.

Council Member Cordell asked Mr. Smith how not having an amortization
and a nonconforming use termination date would affect his interest in the
property.

Mr. Smith said it would not affect it.

Mayor Kleinberg asked for clarification on the section dealing with
sustainability with the green building design.

Mr. Williams said the Architectural Review Board has its own set of
sustainability issues.

Mayor Kleinberg asked whether the Architectural Review Board or the
Planning and Transportation Commission would handle it.

Mr. Williams said the Architectural Review Board would review and respond,
the Planning Department would receive it along with the Planning and
Transportation Commission or the Council.

Mayor Kleinberg said she would like more consideration placed on
ordinances about green building design in the future.

Council Member Klein requested proposals be received by Earth Day 2007 on
the what and how of green building design.
