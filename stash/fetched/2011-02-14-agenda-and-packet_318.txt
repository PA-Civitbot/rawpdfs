     C. Debate and Voting.

           1. Presiding officer to state motion. The presiding officer shall assure that
           all motions are clearly stated before allowing debate to begin. The presiding
           officer may restate the motion or may direct the City Clerk to restate the
           motion before allowing debate to begin. The presiding officer shall restate
           the motion or direct the City Clerk to restate the motion prior to voting.

            2. Presiding officer may debate and vote. The presiding officer may move,
            second and debate from the chair, subject only to such limitations of debate
            as are by these rules imposed on all Council Members. The presiding officer
            shall not be deprived of any of the rights and privileges of a Council
            Member.




                                                                                                          Attachment: 2.15.11 (1422 : Policy and Services Agenda 2/15/2011)
            3. Division of question. If the question contains two or more divisible
            propositions, each of which is capable of standing as a complete proposition
            if the others are removed, the presiding officer may, and upon request of a
            member shall, divide the same. The presiding officer's determination shall
            be appealable by any Council Member.

            4. Withdrawal of motion. A motion may not be withdrawn by the maker
            without the consent of the Council Member seconding it.

            5. Change of vote. Council Members may change their votes before the
            next item on the agenda is called.

            6. Voting. On the passage of every motion, the vote shall be taken by voice
            or roll call or electronic voting device and entered in full upon the record.

            7. Silence constitutes affirmative vote. Council Members who are silent
            during a voice vote shall have their vote recorded as an affirmative vote,
            except when individual Council Members have stated in advance that they
            will not be voting.

            8. Failure to vote. It is the responsibility of every Council Member to vote
            unless disqualified for cause accepted by the Council or by opinion of the
            City Attorney. No Council Member can be compelled to vote.

            9. Abstaining from vote. Council Members should only abstain if they are
            not sufficiently informed about an item, e.g. when there was a prior hearing
            and they were unable to view the prior meeting before the current meeting.
            In the event of an abstention the abstainer in effect, "consents" that a
            majority of the quorum of the Council Members present may act for him or
            her.
