STUDY SESSION

1.   Joint City Council/Planning & Transportation Commission Study
     Session Regarding the Comprehensive Plan Amendment and Housing
     Element Update.

Director of Planning and Community Environment, Curtis Williams provided
an overview of the purpose of comprehensive plans, discussed some of the
positives and negative outcomes resulting under the City's 1998-2010
Comprehensive Plan, and recounted the Comprehensive Plan Amendment
work program approved by Council in 2006. He outlined four key issues for
City    Council     and     Planning    and     Transportation     Commission
(PTC) consideration for the Amendment, including: 1) growth projections, 2)
the Housing Element, and particularly the housing allocation by the
Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) and the City's approach to
compliance, 3) the Vision Statements, goals, and policies of the Plan and the
extent of potential revisions, and 4) possible components of the Amendment
(e.g., area plans for downtown and south El Camino Real, high speed rail,
and sea level rise) that would be outside the current scope of work. Staff
suggested that the Council and PTC ask questions about these topics and
then return at a second session to provide direction to staff and the PTC.
