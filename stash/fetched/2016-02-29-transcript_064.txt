religious denominations, from a range of Christian and Jewish and a whole
range of other religious bodies all came together and expressed that our
region has a value structure that is embracing of diversity and caring for one
another. I think this, in this climate, is something that's increasingly

Adjournment: The meeting was adjourned at 9:18 P.M.
