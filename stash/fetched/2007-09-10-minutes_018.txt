Council Member Morton asked whether waiving the fee for a subset of the
applicants would then be considered denying people the right to run.

City Attorney Gary Baum stated it was a voluntary program and the City was
not required to pay for that statement.

Council Member Morton said the City was not required to pay could choose
to set a limitation on the amount of money they raised and asked whether it
was challengeable.

Mr. Baum stated there were systems utilized by other communities.

Council Member Mossar asked whether the total expenditures would be
capped at $30,000.

Mr. Baum stated it was possible but it was the direction of P&S to have it
capped and it could be adjusted by the Council.

Council Member Drekmeier stated there was no limit on how much money
was raised but there was a limit to how much was spent.

Council Member Kleinberg stated that P&S asked for the limit to be adjusted
annually.

Mr. Baum stated the minutes said the $300 per contributor was adjusted by
the Consumer Price Index (CPI) but he believed the cap would come back to
the Council.

Council Member Drekmeier stated it was decided that it was not a legal issue
and it was not necessary to raise it to keep up with the economy.

Council Member Kleinberg stated she was referring to the $30,000.

Council Member Drekmeier stated it was the same for that and it could be
changed to reflect concern.

Council Member Kleinberg stated there was concern for the language and
that amount being a cap. She asked whether this was a requirement that
you must opt out of in order to save money.

Mr. Baum stated that not every system had a pledge.

Council Member Kleinberg stated this looked like a system asking to
involuntarily tell whether you are or are not going to observe the system and
you cannot file without doing so.
