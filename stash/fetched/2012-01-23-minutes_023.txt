Mr. Larkin thought the Council could set a policy to require new batteries.
He felt it would become an issue if the Council's requirements were not
feasible.

Council Member Burt noted the concern of setting a precedence with regard
to the Master Plan and the prospect of 80 additional poles.

Mr. Williams indicated it was 60 additional poles for a total of 80.

Council Member Burt inquired if approval of the design could be worded such
that it wouldn't set a precedence.

Mr. Larkin stated the proposal tonight was for 20 poles only. He indicated it
was a minor Architectural Review and as such the Director could ask for a
full ARB hearing. He thought the Council could express a wish for a full ARB
hearing for every application.

Council Member Burt stated the Council did not want a full ARB hearing for
every application; yet the Council needed to push this forward through
either a Master Plan or progress the design or the technology without being
constrained by tonight's decision.

Mr. Williams did not feel the Council would be constrained by that. He
suggested it was a separate application and could be viewed relative to the
situation at that time.

Council Member Burt asked whether significant trimming of the tree at 1960
Park was a feasible alternative to cutting it down.

Ms. French said the tree appeared to be growing on the park and there was
a concern about cutting trees in the park.

Council Member Burt reminded her his question concerned trimming not
removal.

Ms. French mentioned consulting with arborists.

Council Member Burt asked if that was an alternative.

Ms. French said they hadn't consulted with an arborist.
