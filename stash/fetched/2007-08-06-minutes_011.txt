Council Member Morton questioned the possibility to adjust the map to not
incorporate the Fry’s Electronics property.

Director of Planning and Community Environment Steve Emslie stated the
map could be adjusted to eliminate the Fry’s Electronics area.

Council Member Morton asked for staff’s position.

Mr. Emslie stated staff’s position was that the area be included in the map
since the PDA and the Focus Program are about transportation and
connection and not exclusively about redevelopment.

Council Member Morton asked whether the chance of qualification for State
bonds would be impaired if the area was removed.

Mr. Emslie stated no.

Council Member Morton stated Fry’s Electronics could be added in later.

Mr. Emslie stated the program recommended the area be 100 acres.
Removing Fry’s Electronics from the map would leave approximately 88
acres.

Council Member Morton requested that consideration be given to removing
Fry’s Electronics from the designation.

Vice Mayor Klein moved to strike the Fry’s Electronics area from the PDA.

MOTION: Council Member Morton moved, seconded by Klein, to approve
the staff recommendation with the removal of Fry’s Electronics site from the
Priority Development Area (PDA) and Pedestrian Transient Oriented
Development (PTOD).

Council Member Mossar stated the larger area, including Fry’s Electronics,
had been a study area in the Comprehensive Plan from the beginning.

Council Member Morton encouraged the removal of Fry’s Electronics, which
could be added at a future time.

Herb Borock, P.O. Box 632, stated this issue is a serious planning issue and
requires a recommendation from the Planning and Transportation
Commission.

Mayor Kishimoto stated the item will go through the Planning and
Transportation Commission.
