records. It's a calendar year number, so this is actually the number that
was from the end of 2015. The number from the end of 2016 wasn't
available yet. Some interesting things from the Performance Report related
to street repair is that the number of potholes repaired increased about 15
percent, but the percent repaired within 15 days increased from 81 percent
to 94 percent. We're doing more of them, but we're also doing them
quicker. The number of lane miles resurfaced increased about 35 percent,
from 28.9 to 39. I think that's reflected in that increase in the Pavement
Condition Index. Residents have noticed that change; their ratings in the
past 5 years on street repair has increased from 40 percent to 57 percent.
Another thing related to what you see out on the streets is the sidewalks.
The number of square feet of sidewalks repaired or replaced has also
increased. Again, the respondents to the National Citizens Survey noticed
that with a 10 point increase in the ratings from 2011 to 2016. Just for a
side comment. When you have questions after, I do have in my notes where
these numbers come from in the survey. If you have questions about a
specific point in here, I'll be able to refer you to it fairly quickly as we go
through this. Still related to the built environment. When we talk about
building permits, the number of building permits issued declined about 2
percent. The average number of days to first response to plan checks also
declined; it was about 40 percent from 35 days to 21 days. That's a big
improvement. Even though it says declined, it means improvement. You
want those days to decline. The average days to issue a permit also
declined, about 51 percent. They've cut the amount of time needed to issue
a permit slightly more than half. They've also increased the number of
inspections completed, about 64 percent, from almost 17,000 to almost
28,000. However, the NCS ratings, the National Citizens Survey ratings, of
excellent or good for the overall built environment declined from 67 percent
to 59 percent. That was since 2014 because the question wasn't asked prior
to that. One thing that's important to note about the survey is that even
though we have these scores, we don't ask why people think what they
think. We get these points of interest from them, but we don't really know
why they responded the way they did. That's something to think about as
you think about these percentages.           Planning applications have also
increased from 359 to 393, and the completed planning applications
increased about 61 percent, from 238 to 383.             The number of ARB
applications declined from 121 to 46. That was a 62 percent decline. The
average weeks to complete staff-level applications increased by about 8
weeks. The number of excellent or good ratings for land use planning and
zoning declined 8 percentage points, from 45 percent to 37 percent. The
number of new Code enforcement cases has declined about 50 percent. The
number of cases resolved within 120 days increased about 3 percentage
points.    Citizens are still not recognizing Code enforcement as being
excellent or good; it continues on a downward trend and went from 56
