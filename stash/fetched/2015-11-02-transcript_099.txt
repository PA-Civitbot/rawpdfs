Council Member DuBois: I hope this is the last one. L-8 is really important,
and we've spent a lot of time on this. I'm hoping we'll get to a vote here.
I'll accept that one.

Mayor Holman: Council Member Burt?

Council Member Burt: Yeah.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to add to the Motion, “direct Staff and the CAC to
Maintain and strengthen the existing language supporting housing supply for
diverse family sizes, ages, ability levels, and income levels.”

Mayor Holman: Anything else?

Council Member Wolbach: Let me just make sure you got all that. Actually,
"for diverse family sizes." Actually I'll just take it (inaudible) I can show it to
him.

Mayor Holman: Council Member Filseth. Seeing no other lights, I have one
question for Council Member Burt, since this amendment has been accepted.
Council Member Burt, on "H," did you want that to really be University
Avenue and California Avenue and exclude El Camino? You could just say
"small unit residential in appropriate areas including."

Council Member Burt: I was intending for the focus to be on those two
areas. It's a reasonable question whether we would want to broaden it
beyond that.

Mayor Holman: That is my question. I'm asking for an amendment ...

Council Member Burt: Why don't we—how about "with particular emphasis
on University Avenue and California Avenue"? That doesn't exclude this.

Mayor Holman: I can go for that.

Council Member DuBois: I would support that.             I don't really want to
broaden it further right now.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to replace in the Motion Part H, “residential in
the” with “residential with particular emphasis on.”

Mayor Holman: "With particular emphasis," there you go. "With particular
emphasis on University Avenue and California Avenue." That makes me
complete. Council Member Filseth.
