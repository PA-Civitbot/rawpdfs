40 CFR Part 503, Subpart E.

        Furthermore, in the course of developing the Part 503 regulations, EPA also proposed to establish
requirements for dioxins (including specific congeners of dioxin, dibenzofuran, and coplanar PCBs).1 However,
after evaluating the emissions of dioxins from sewage sludge incineration, as well as surface disposal and land
application, EPA decided such requirements were not warranted.2 This decision was based on the results of a
comprehensive risk assessment that demonstrated that dioxin levels in biosolids and biosolids incinerator
exhaust gases do not pose a significant risk to human health or the environment.3

        As explained in detail in NACWA’s 1997 comments to EPA (pages 15-17), the numeric emission limits
and management practices requirements established under the Part 503 regulations were derived from years of
study and evaluation of the potential risks to human health and the environment which could be posed by the
incineration of sewage sludge.4 (Attachment A – Compendium of NACWA Correspondence to EPA) The
regulation of SSIs under this existing regime is via risk-based standards that were developed to protect human
health and the environment from any reasonably anticipated adverse effects from pollutants that may be
present in sewage sludge. In fact, the Part 503 regulations for SSIs were developed through a partnership
between EPA’s water and air offices – a partnership that continues today as EPA conducts its mandated review
of the Part 503 standards. As a result, SSIs can clearly demonstrate that the emissions from their units are not
adversely impacting human health and the environment by maintaining compliance with the Part 503
requirements. Moreover, the statutory framework of this regime provides ample means for EPA to identify and
regulate additional concerns if supported by scientific evidence. For example, CWA § 405 provides for a
biennial review process that was specifically established for identifying and regulating any additional pollutants
of concern. EPA has repeatedly emphasized its confidence that the Part 503 regulations are adequately
protective of public health and the environment.5

        Additionally, since 1975 EPA has imposed NESHAPs for mercury and beryllium emissions that apply to
certain SSIs. See 40 CFR Part 61, Subpart E and C. The mercury NESHAP applies, in relevant part, to any
source that incinerates sludges from wastewater treatment plants. The NESHAP imposes emission limits for
mercury, as well as stack testing, sampling, and monitoring requirements. See 40 CFR Part 61, Subpart E. The
beryllium NESHAP applies, in relevant part, to incinerators that process beryllium-containing waste. This
