Mr. Keene stated the goal was not to rush the project but to stop removing
any further trees until Staff could return to Council in early November with a
report.

Council Member Klein asked what the expected timing was to have the
report completed.

Mr. Keene stated his expectation was to have the report released in phases
but he would keep the Council informed.

Council Member Klein stated his concern was the investigation would focus
on lower level Staff members and he asked whether the report would be
thorough through the entire chain of command.

Mr. Keene stated the newspapers and internal Staff had not been
communicating accurate information as to what would be in the report.

Council Member Klein asked whether the report would consider what it was
in the Department’s culture that would have enabled the involved parties to
believe they could venture so far out in violating the City’s adopted policies.

Mr. Keene stated yes, the report incorporated all aspects of the how’s and
why’s such an incident could occur.

Council Member Klein asked whether the process of the watering system
would be brought to Council.

Mr. Emslie stated the current plan was for the trees to be hand watered by
the water truck which traveled throughout the City and watered a number of
the trees currently planted.

Council Member Klein asked whether there would be a cost analysis
comparison for the water truck versus an automated system.

Mr. Emslie stated yes, when Staff returned to Council.

Council Member Klein asked for clarification on the third recommendation,
the approval of recommended action. He stated there was no action shown
to be approved.

Mr. Emslie stated Staff was asking for more time to work up a more
comprehensive program.

Council Member Klein stated he understood Staff needed time; however, he
was concerned he was being asked to approve something that was not
formulated as of yet.
