Council Member Kniss: Thank you for that clarification. The last is far more
pertinent to my neighborhood. Ever since Oregon got fixed, it has been
extremely hard to cross from north to south or south to north. The lights
are very peculiarly set up. I'm not quite sure how. I told Jim about this
before, so I'm going to presume that that will be a County/City issue.

James Keene, City Manager: We're already reaching out to the County. It's
their lead on that.

Council Member Kniss: I see near collisions there a lot where they've got
the awkward lighting. That's my wish list, just three little things.

Mayor Holman: I want to quickly report that Council Members Kniss, DuBois
and I were in Monterrey this last week for a conference there. I found
myself saying as yet another presenter was giving a nod to City Manager,
"Jim, is there anybody you don't know?" It was worthwhile I'm sure. The
three of us will be sending comments and information to you all as we catch
up and catch our breaths after tonight about what all we learned there.
Prior to that I was the U.S. Conference of Mayors in San Francisco, and
same with that. It's been a remarkable last week with Supreme Court
decisions.

Adjournment: The meeting was adjourned at 10:18 P.M.
