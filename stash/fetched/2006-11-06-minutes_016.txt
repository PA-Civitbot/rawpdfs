Council Member Klein asked what the cost and time would be to go through
the process again to add the PF-D designation.

Mr. Emslie said he would have to analyze the time required.

Council Member Klein asked what the cost would be to re-advertise the
public hearing.

City Clerk Donna Rogers said it would be approximately $200.

Council Member Klein agreed with Mr. Borock and recalled that years ago
notices used to read “or such other zone as the P&TC and the Council found
appropriate.”

Mr. Baum said he was not aware of how notices read in the past, but he
confirmed the current notice did not include the language.

Council Member Klein asked if there was a policy in place not to use such
language.

Mr. Emslie said that had been the wording in the notice for the past five
years.

Council Member Klein said he would support the motion.

Mr. Baum said he would verify the language.
