Mr. Stephens said staff had set the standard.

Mayor Burch said he wanted to go to the public for comments.

Ellen Gold, 3980 El Camino Real, said the owner of the property where the
cell tower was to be installed would not maintain the plantings installed.

Harold Stephenson, 4054 Villa Vista, said it was not a good location for the
cell tower. He did not believe the owner would maintain the tower.

Ed Jones, 543 Military Way, said information had not been available as to
the reason T-Mobile needed a tower.

Bob Moss, 4010 Orme Street, said fines should be imposed if Mr. Jisser
failed to comply with the installation and maintenance of the landscaping
and irrigation systems.

Mr. Stephens asked whether there were any questions.

Council Member Kishimoto asked why the coverage maps had not been
provided prior to that evening.

Mr. Stephens said Cingular prepared the original coverage maps and T-
Mobile had enhanced them for the meeting.

Council Member Kishimoto asked whether the maps were one and the same
and if the map submitted for Cingular applied to T-Mobile.

Mr. Stephens confirmed and advised Cingular merged with AT&T. T-Mobile
acquired the Cingular network with exceptions.

Council Member Kishimoto asked whether Cingular and T-Mobile were one
network.

Vice Mayor Kleinberg commented that T-Mobile took over some of the
Cingular sites because Cingular had to divest.

Mr. Stephens said he did not know whether Cingular had to divest.

Vice Mayor Kleinberg said they had to divest. She asked whether T-Mobile
owned all the sites in Barron Park.

Mr. Stephens said they did not.
