Council Member Ojakian said he wanted to stay with the present option. The
basketball poles would be placed in a manner that would not interfere with
fire access.

Council Member Lytle asked if there was another place that could be
considered.

Council Member Ojakian replied not at the present time.

Council Member Kishimoto said she was pleased the PAUSD supported
keeping the pathway open and believed the case was strengthened for

Mr. Benest said he would like the PARC to consider the cost effectiveness of
