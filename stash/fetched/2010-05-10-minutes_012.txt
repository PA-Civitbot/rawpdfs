Council Member Scharff asked what was meant by scoping analysis of
adjacency issues.

Council Member Holman said she was looking for compatibility and typical
land use planning adjacency issues.

Council Member Scharff asked whether the analysis would incur additional
cost.

Mr. Roberts said in Staffâ€™s opinion the adjacency between the HHW Facility
and the RWCQCP was not an issue and there would be an extra cost in
having to perform an analysis. He said the Resource Recovery Park was not
being developed at this time and did not understand the need for an
analysis.

AMENDMENT RESTATED: Council Member Holman moved, seconded by
Council Member Schmid that adjacency issues be addressed for the
compatibility of the bike path, resource recovery park, and the issues of the
household hazardous waste being adjacent to the RWQCP.

Council Member Holman said if the land was being preserved for future use
it was important to know compatibility issues ahead of time.

Vice Mayor Espinosa questioned the placement of trees indicated in the plan.

Mr. Roberts clarified the plans set before the Council this evening were
conceptual plans for informational purposes only and to not be locked in to
the design. He clarified what Council was being asked to approve was the
usage of the entire site for the Household Hazardous Waste Program,
Recycling Center, and the future potential use of Resource Recovery Park.

AMENDMENT TO THE AMENDMENT:               Council Member Klein moved,
seconded by Council Member Price to remove from the Amendment
evaluating issues of the household hazardous waste being adjacent to the
RWQCP.
