Chief Marinaro said the second fire occurred on a high fire day.

Council Member Kleinberg asked the number of acres of the “dish” burned
on the low fire day.

Chief Marinaro said 171 acres were burned.

Council Member Morton asked for the travel time from Station 8 to the
“dish.”

Chief Marinaro said it was approximately 8 to 10 minutes.

Mayor Kishimoto asked why the first fire at the “dish” was not considered a
high fire danger day.

Chief Marinaro stated the burn index had not exceeded 60.

Mayor Kishimoto asked where the City was with standards of coverage for
allocating limited resources for Station 8.

Mr. Benest said the study had not been undertaken.

Mayor Kishimoto asked whether the Union was resistant to prevent less
coverage elsewhere throughout the City.

Mr. Benest said the Fire and City Management believed cross-staffing was
rational and the Fire Union did not concur.

Council Member Morton asked whether mediation was an option for coming
to a compromise with the Union.

Mr. Benest said there was a minimum staffing provision in the contract. If
Station 8 was opened the minimum level of staffing required to be increased
by two.

Council Member Kleinberg asked whether there was a policy in place that
required overtime for staff specifically for Station 8.

Chief Marinaro said the contract states when Station 8 was open, minimum
staffing increased by two and had been staffed with overtime personnel.
