SUBSTITUTE MOTION PASSED 8-0, Ojakian absent.

Council Member Kishimoto added another recommendation to the program to
change the emphasis from only electronic to encompass multi-modal streets and
livable corridors.

Council Member Lytle said it was a good direction if there was leeway for more
than just electronics to try and expand the content of the program.

Mr. Emslie said adding electronic components would make the streets more
multi-modal

Council Member Kishimoto asked if there was an objection to adding “multi-
modal.”

Mr. Emslie agreed to the title change.

Council Member Morton said he wanted to present a substitute motion to
approve staff’s proposed recommendation.

Council Member Kleinberg asked if the title change would have any impact other
than descriptive.

Mr. Kott said it would not.

Council Member Ojakian said he supported the Resolution and introduced VTA
representatives, Chris Augenstein and Adam Berger.
