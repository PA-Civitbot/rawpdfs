Council Member Morton asked to remove the item from the Consent
Calendar due to the attendance of the press and the volume of public
discussion at the meeting. He was in support of hearing the appeal because
the community needed a forum to hear the issues.            Council had a
responsibility to hear neighbors’ differences when issues reached a certain
level.

Council Member Cordell said in listening to all the statements made, she
would not comment on the merit but looked to whether or not there was
procedural due process and concluded there was procedural due process in
getting to that point. She had not heard a basis for going forward with a
hearing on the merits and would listen for her colleagues’ additional
comments on whether to go forward or not.

Council Member Kishimoto upheld staff’s recommendation and did not
support a hearing.

Vice Mayor Kleinberg said procedural fairness had been accomplished, and
she did not support another hearing.

Mayor Burch did not support another hearing.

Mr. Baum asked the Mayor to repeat the motion.

Mayor Burch said the motion was to decline to hear the appeal.

Council Member Morton requested a point of order and thought the
additional remark was if it passed it would return to the Council.

MOTION PASSED 5-1, Morton no, Freeman, Mossar, Ojakian absent.

MOTION: Council Member Beecham moved to have the item return on the
next Council agenda for a full Council vote without public testimony.

Ms. Harrison advised Council Member Beecham the next scheduled meeting
was to discuss the Zoning Ordinance Update (ZOU), which would be a
lengthy meeting. She felt it was not the best time to have the item return to
Council.
