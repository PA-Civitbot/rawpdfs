Council Member Kniss: I agree that they're happening fast. The question
will be can our Staff move fast enough on that or are we going to all end up
being frustrated.

Council Member DuBois: Council Member ...

Mayor Holman:     Council Member Kniss, could I ask Staff to answer your
question?

Council Member Kniss:      Thank you.     That's probably a better idea than
asking Tom.

Mr. Reichental: Can you say it one more time? Sorry.

Council Member Burt: What's your question?

Mr. Reichental: I didn't capture it all. Sorry.

Council Member Kniss: I went through the "A" and said that if we're really
talking about this by the end of the first—we're talking about this by
December 31st, that we adopt the goal, that we agree to City ownership of

ambitious goal.

Council Member DuBois:        Council Member Burt is proposing different
language of "preferred alternative" instead of "goal."
