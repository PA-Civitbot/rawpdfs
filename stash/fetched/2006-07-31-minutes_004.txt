MOTION WITHDRAWN BY MAKER AND SECONDER

MOTION: Council Member Drekmeier moved, seconded by Cordell, that the
Council Members rank their choices number 1, 2, or 3, with a roll up of
votes.

Council Member Mossar stated due to the inability to agree on the second
candidate she suggested another round of applications.

Council Member Klein agreed with Council Member Mossar and said he
believes Council should not change the procedure at this time, as suggested
by Council Member Drekmeier.

Council Member Cordell stated she does not agree with advertising again for
candidates.

MOTION PASSED 5-3 Barton, Klein, Mossar voting no, Morton not
participating.
