Mayor Burt clarified his reference was to the contractual agreement the
Cityâ€™s had throughout the State with landfills.

Mr. Dornell stated in order to attempt to accomplish the goal, Staff had
recommended sub-leasing the area not being used by the City to outside
agencies; therefore, bringing in a revenue source for the use of the landfill.

Mayor Burt stated that recommendation had been discussed previously and
was halted because there were no perspective buyers. He asked if there
were perspective buyers available at present.

Mr. Dornell stated a number of agencies were locked into long-term
contracts and were uninterested in making payments for the contracts
currently in play.

Mayor Burt asked if there was a calculation on the cost for the extra street
sweeping.

Mr. Dornell stated that was one of the factors being studied by the Cost of
Services Study.

Mr. Keene stated Staff could provide an estimated cost having knowledge of
the number of customers and the cost of street sweeping.

Mayor Burt asked how it was possible to have had a 17 percent rate increase
in 2009 and merely a 2 percent revenue increase while the cost for
household had essentially remained level.

Mr. Dornell stated the cost per household had gone down which explained
the decrease in revenue.

Mayor Burt stated Staff cited a 2 percent revenue increase.

Mr. Dornell stated that was correct, he intended to say expenses. The
expenses had remained the same while the revenue had increased.

Mayor Burt asked if the revenue went up 2 percent was that not on average
what was being paid per household and business.

Ms. Eyerly stated yes. There was a 17 percent increase across the board
while a majority of the revenue shortfall came from the commercial
accounts.
