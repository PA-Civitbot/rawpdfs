with the School Board and with a whole variety. There should be some long-
term sustenance of how we fund this. I hope we will be heading in that
direction.

Council Member Scharff: I wanted to understand where we were. I'd like to
see this wrapped up. Are we going to make a Motion to approve the budget
tentatively? Is that the time to do that?

Mayor Holman: A tentative Motion.

Council Member Scharff: Is that the time to make the tentative Motion?

Mayor Holman: You may.

Council Member Scharff: Let me ask a question first before I make it. In
your memorandum, you had two other changes. You had the Technology
person and the parking person. If I make a Motion to approve the budget
as set forth on Page 1, starting with "A," a Budget Amendment Ordinance
which includes. That's the Motion you're looking for, right?

Mr. Keene: That includes these cost savings.

Council Member Scharff: That includes them. I will make the Motion that
we approve the Budget Amendment Ordinance as set forth on packet Page
191.

Council Member Kniss: I would second it.

Council Member Scharff: Do I need to include all of the Amendments we
made? Is that how we do it?

Mr. Keene: All of the Amendments that have been made so far?

Council Member Scharff: Yeah. Do I say that or it's not necessary? We just
know that it's in there. I wasn't sure if you need it all in there or not.

Mayor Holman: Just say "as Amended."

Mr. Perez: Yes. The only question I have—and maybe me, not the rest of
the table—I’m not sure we got to the AEDs.

Mayor Holman: What Council Member Scharff is doing is the main Motion.
We can still amend it and add Amendments to it.

Mr. Perez: Yeah.
