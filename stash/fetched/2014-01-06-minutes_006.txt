ACTION ITEMS

2.   Election of the Mayor for 2014.

Mayor Scharff said Council Members were able to nominate themselves or
other Council Members for the position of Mayor; there was no second
required for the nomination. After collecting the nominations he planned on
inviting people to speak in the following order: Council Members who made
the nomination, Council Members that were nominated, any other Council
Members, and members of the public. After the discussion there would be a
vote for Mayor. The appointment of the Vice Mayor was to be handled in the
same way, and then the meeting was to be handed over to the new Mayor.

NOMINATION: Council Member Kniss nominated, seconded by Council
Member Klein to elect Vice Mayor Shepherd for Mayor for 2014.

Council Member Kniss noted that if Vice Mayor Nancy Shepherd was elected,
she would be the 12th woman Mayor.            She spoke about Vice Mayor
Shepherdâ€™s history, experience, credentials, and qualifications. She felt that
the new Mayor needed to be tough and resilient, and that described Vice
Mayor Nancy Shepherd.

Council Member Klein agreed with Council Member Kniss and said one
problem that Council faced was meeting length. Vice Mayor Nancy Shepherd
was a good candidate because she responded to citizens, she reached out to
people, she was energetic, and was diplomatic regarding major issues that
faced the Council in past; she was able to disagree without being
disagreeable.
