Action Items

16.   City of Palo Alto Appeal of Adopted Regional Housing Needs Allocation
      (RHNA) for the 2014-2022 Housing Element Cycle.

Curtis Williams, Director of Planning and Community Environment reported a
letter had been drafted to the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG)
to appeal the Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) made to Palo Alto
specifically.     The Regional Housing Mandate Committee (RHMC)
recommended approval of the letter on a 3-1 vote. The appeal focused on
transferring 350 units located at the Stanford University campus from the
City of Palo Alto to the County, because of the close location of those units
to the University Avenue train station. Discussions between Staff and
County Staff were somewhat promising; however the City needed to
preserve its right to appeal.

Robert Moss agreed an appeal should be filed. The appeal should also
include an objection regarding incorrect population growth estimates.
