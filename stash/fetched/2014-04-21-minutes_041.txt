Council Member Burt suggested the Council raise the issue as it would rally
Peninsula cities around a common position. He advocated for the Council to
include language that funds should be used for purposes within the corridor.

James Keene, City Manager, read information provided by Ms. Levin
regarding the original decisions and the project.

Council Member Burt inquired whether the information referred to the
Peninsula Rail Corridor.

Mr. Keene understood it to reference the corridor across the Bay.

Council Member Burt asked if the Santa Clara Valley Transportation
Authority (VTA) discussed the proposal and took a position on it.

Mr. Hackmann advised VTA had not taken a position opposing the loan
forgiveness.

Council Member Burt asked if VTA took a position supporting it.

Mr. Hackmann understood VTA did.

Council Member Price reported the last official action by the VTA Board
regarding the corridor was approval of the 2013-2015 Budget in June 2013.
The Dumbarton Rail Corridor item was zeroed out with a carryover
appropriation of $141,000. That amount was decreased from the original
budgeted amount of $2.4 million. PAC agreed that VTA would not support
money allocated to the project. The VTA Board voted in that manner. She
did not believe VTA had taken a specific position on the item recently.

Council Member Burt inquired about the position Council Member Price took
as the City's representative to the VTA.

Council Member Price noted the vote occurred prior to her joining the VTA
Board.

Council Member Burt asked what position she took as a member of PAC.

Council Member Price believed the majority of PAC agreed with the staff
recommendation.

Council Member Burt asked what position Council Member Price took as the
City's representative.
