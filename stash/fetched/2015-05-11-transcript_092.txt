Council Member Questions, Comments and Announcements

Council Member Burt: I just wanted to share that Council Member Wolbach
and I attended the drought summit on Saturday. It was a very significant
regional most-of-the-day conference.       Frankly, this last discussion
intertwines with this. The messages were not only what we have to do as
cities and can do as cities to do our share in addressing the short-term
drought, but it was also what we need to do in long-term strategies to have
sustainable water systems and water supplies. What did become apparent
through a lot of the comments were that Palo Alto has a lot more that we've
been doing in policies and programs concretely to address our water usage.
There's a lot more that we can and need to do. Compared to other cities,
we're doing quite a lot. It gives us a great foundation to achieving our
goals.

Adjournment: The meeting was adjourned at 12:21 A.M.
