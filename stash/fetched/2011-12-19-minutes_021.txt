Council Member Holman agreed, but noted the concluding paragraph did
not.

Council Member Burt indicated he and Council Member Shepherd tried to be
concise, and listed some but not all significant requirements.

Council Member Schmid inquired if the motion concerned the Guiding
Principles.

Mayor Espinosa responded affirmatively.

Council Member Schmid asked whether it included the 15 listed Principles.

Council Member Shepherd referenced the introduction on the next page
concerning the City's positions on the HSR Project should the State move
forward with the Project. She stated the bulk of it was making a new overall
policy statement.

Council Member Schmid asked to amend Principle 14, substituting seek for
consider in the statement "if Caltrain and/or High Speed Rail increases train
service, Palo Alto will consider grade separation solutions."

Council Member Shepherd noted her motion did not include all of the Guiding
Principles. She suggested the Council discuss each separately to allow
discussion of overall policy now.

Council Member Schmid agreed.

Mayor Espinosa stated he would come back to Council Member Schmid when
they discussed Principle 14.

Council Member Price believed members of the public wanted to speak
before the vote, after which she would like to comment.

Mayor Espinosa noted public comment for the report portion of Item No. 8
had closed; therefore, he would allow public comment concerning the
Guiding Principles.

Bill Nugteren stated he was a civil engineer, had lived in the City since 1964,
and had used Caltrain to commute to San Francisco. He felt the proposed
statements were elitist. He recommended adoption of either statement, and
suggested a premise that the community considered HSR as important for
the State of California. He believed California was 50 years late in building
HSR.
