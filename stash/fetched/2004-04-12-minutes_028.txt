COUNCIL COMMENTS, QUESTIONS, AND ANNOUNCEMENTS

Council Member Mossar stated she recently attended a Gateway Corridor
Outreach meeting in East Palo Alto, which was an outstanding opportunity to
hear concerns of both Palo Alto and East Palo Alto.

Council Member Freeman spoke to the two quarterly demographic reports of
complaints from the Police Department and asked why the format and timing
of the data collection were substantially different and would they be
quarterly.

Assistant City Manager Emily Harrison said there was a delay in order for
accuracy in the analysis.

Service Contracts awarded by the City Manager from 7/2003 â€“ 12/2003,

timeframe.
