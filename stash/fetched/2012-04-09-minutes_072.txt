                      DRAFT MINUTES

Council Member Schmid said they had heard repeatedly that if
they wanted to make the committee work that they needed to
make sure that PAUSD felt that they were involved. He said that
currently there was a tremendous imbalance between school
members and City appointed members and that it made sense to
reach out to the school community and expand by at least two.

Council Member Price agreed with the comments. She was also
concerned that there was a real difference between school
representatives and people with educational expertise. She was
concerned that people who had knowledge about the delivery of
educational services served, not to say PTA individuals did not
have that, but she wanted educational professionals as well such
as college professors and others.

Council Member Espinosa said he did not think that it was under
their purview, but since they were commenting he knew the City
Manager had stated that he had heard from people on the list
that they were not aware they were on the list. He hoped that
with the extra week they were sure that everyone listed knew
they were listed and wanted to be on the list.

Council Member Holman said that she did not believe the Motion
was intended to tell the City Manager to find two PAUSD
representatives; it was a joint process, so the City Manager would
talk to the Superintendent to identify who the other school
representatives were.

Council Member Shepherd said that the way she remembered the
list being composed initially was a gathering of stakeholders,
some being neighbors that were next door to Cubberley, others
at-large and so she did not understand why it seemed odd that
two more school representatives be included.
