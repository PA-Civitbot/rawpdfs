ACTION ITEMS

8.   Colleagues Memo from Mayor Scharff and Council Member Klein to Add
     a Fourth Member to the Council’s Committee on Infrastructure.

Mayor Scharff felt the Committee should have four members rather than
three. The City's Brown Act Committees tended to have four members.
Having four members led to better discussions and outcomes.

Council Member Klein explained the Committee's existence would exceed the
six-month guideline issued by the City Attorney; therefore, it was a Standing
Committee and all Standing Committees had four members.

MOTION: Council Member Klein moved, seconded by Vice Mayor Shepherd
that the Infrastructure Committee be a Brown Act Committee composed of
four Council Members appointed by the Mayor.
