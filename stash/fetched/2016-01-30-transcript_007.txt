out. I'm not exactly sure what that means, but the opportunity is there with
much more of the collection available.        Also showing the increase in
opportunities to attend cultural art events, attendance at the Children's
Theatre performances increased 45 percent, or the number of performances
increased 45 percent, and the attendance increased 36 percent from about
25,000 to about 34,000.        However, there was a bit of a decline at
Community Theatre performances. Those were down about 5 percent;
although, the number of performances were only down about 1 percent.
The number of visitors to the Art Center exhibitions increased 26 percent
from about 17,000 to almost 22,000 since 2010. Slide 17 starts moving into
the mobility facet.     The Performance Report showed that City shuttle
boardings have increased 11 percent since 2010 from about 138,000 to
about 152,000, and that the Caltrain average weekday boardings in Palo
Alto increased 101 percent from about 4,300 to about 8,700, 8,800. Despite
more people using public transportation, however, the Citizen Survey
respondents generally did not see mobility in Palo Alto as excellent or good.
Traffic flow on major streets declined 47 percent to 31 percent. Despite
more people using public transportation, they're seeing worse traffic flow.
Traffic signal timing declined 56 percent to 47 percent. Ease of travel by
car, ease of travel by public transportation and ease of travel by bicycle, all
of those saw declines in the respondent ratings to the Citizen Survey despite
the increase in public transportation opportunities. Moving on to the natural
environment facet, Slide 18.

Ms. Richardson: Yes.

Council Member Kniss: So that we have the overall picture, I think it's really
important to mention that as we go along. That was a time of real stress, I
think, in the community. We're quite the opposite at the moment.

Ms. Richardson: In the natural environment, what has changed since then.
Respondents to the survey that rated natural environment questions as
excellent or good, those increased slightly.          Air quality increased.
Cleanliness of Palo Alto slightly declined one point. Preservation of natural
areas declined one point. Overall quality of natural environment increased
two points. All of those are within the margin of error. The margin of error
for this report is plus or minus 4 percent, so you expect that to be within the
normal range. It's not really considered a change in terms of normal survey
protocols. However, City expenditures to operate and maintain open space,
parks and the golf course increased 53 percent from 5.8 million to 8.9
million. A good portion of that increase was for parks and landscape
maintenance which increased 30 percent, 3 million to 3.9 percent. Another
