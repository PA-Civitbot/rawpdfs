CONSENT CALENDAR

City Clerk Donna Rogers noted for the record that due to lack of a quorum,
Item No. 3 could not be heard tonight and would be continued to October
16, 2006. Council Members Cordell, Klein and Mossar could not participate
due to conflicts and Mayor Kleinberg and Council Member Beecham were
absent.

MOTION: Council Member Morton moved, seconded by Klein, to approve
Consent Calendar Items 4, 5, 7, and 8.

Council Member Barton stated he would not participate in Item No. 4, as he
had a conflict of interest since his wife worked with two of the developers for
the project, and requested to note he would be abstaining on the resolutions
to support Propositions 86 and 89.


Council Member Mossar registered a no vote on Item No. 5.

MOTION: Council Member Klein moved, seconded by Kishimoto, to remove
Item No. 6 from consent to become Item No. 8A.
