Council Member Klein said he wanted to vote on Item No. 3, but required
further clarification since the agenda stated Item No. 3 was a second
reading.

Mr. Emslie said to clarify the situation, he suggested bringing back both
items for another hearing to review the P&TC’s recommendation on both
items and to accurately reflect Council’s direction.

Mr. Baum noted the hearing would be for changes and staff would be
prepared to answer Council’s questions.

Council Member Klein asked whether a second reading was allowed on Item
No. 3 at this evening’s meeting.

Mr. Baum said yes.

Council Member Klein asked whether the Council would be voting for a
second reading on Item No. 3 if the vote was made on what currently was
on the table.

Mr. Baum said yes.

Council Member Drekmeier asked whether the floor area ratio (FAR) for
housing would be less if there were no hotel in the formula for the Town and
Country Village Shopping Center.

Mr. Emslie said the formula had not been changed. It was still part of the
recommendation.
