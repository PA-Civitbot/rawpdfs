Council Member Klein understood the item had come before the full Council
in September 2005.

Mr. Fellman said the parcel was declared surplus property and went before
the Council in September 2005 for approval.

Council Member Klein questioned whether the Council had decided the
proceeds from the sale of the property would be dedicated to housing.

Assistant City Manager Emily Harrison said that was correct.

Mayor Kleinberg clarified the Council previously approved using the proceeds
for affordable housing, but never voted to put the property on the market.

Mr. Fellman said the steps included first declaring the property surplus, then
having it rezoned, and finally returning with a Request for Proposal (RFP)
package to place it on the market.

Mayor Kleinberg asked whether approving the property for sale was part of
what the Council voted on when they declared it surplus.

Mr. Fellman said yes.

Council Member Cordell asked when property was declared a surplus it was
then to be sold.

Mr. Baum said if City-owned property was not declared a surplus it could not
be sold or given to any other governmental entity. Merely declaring it a
surplus did not automatically list it for sale.

Council Member Cordell asked whether the item would need to return to
Council for a vote to sell it.

Mr. Baum said that was the City’s process although it was not the only way
to do it.
