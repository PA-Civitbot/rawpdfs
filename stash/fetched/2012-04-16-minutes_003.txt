STUDY SESSION

7.    Overview of Californiaâ€™s Cap-and-Trade Program to Reduce
      Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Impacts on the Operation of Electric
      and Gas Utilities.

Scott Tomashevsky, Regulatory Affairs Manager of the Northern California
Power Agency provided an overview of the regulations related to the cap-
and-trade regulations adopted by the California Air Resources Board (CARB).
Mr. Tomashevsky noted in particular the requirement that the City utilize the
value of allowances to be allocated to its electric utility, including proceeds
from the sale of the allowances in the auctions conducted by CARB
exclusively for the benefit of electric retail ratepayers, consistent with the
States greenhouse gas reduction goals. CARB will conduct quarterly
auctions of the allowances currently scheduled to begin in November 2012.
