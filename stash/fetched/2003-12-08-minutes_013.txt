9A.   (Formerly No. 7.) Approval of Resolution Amending Compensation Plan
      for Management and Professional Employees to Include a Mandatory
      Furlough for Fiscal Year 2003-04

      Resolution 8378 entitled “Resolution of the Council of the City of Palo
      Alto Amending the Compensation Plan for Management and
      Professional Personnel and Council Appointed Officers Adopted by
      Resolution No. 8353, to Include a Mandatory Furlough”

MOTION: Council Member Burch moved, seconded by Morton, to approve
the staff recommendation to Amend the Compensation Plan for Management
and Professional Employees to Include a Mandatory Furlough for Fiscal Year
2003-2004.

Council Member Burch said the Management and Professional group was
given the opportunity to voluntarily reach the targeted goal of 822 days or
$322,000 in savings. He appreciated the City Manager's sensitivity in saying
it looked as if they would not be able to reach the targeted goal, and offer
them the opportunity to take the time-off during the holiday season. He
supported the motion as constructed.

Council Member Morton complemented the staff for their cooperation. He
said the holiday season seemed the most appropriate time in which the
savings could be achieved.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION: Council Member Freeman moved to allow
Management and Professionals to be offered the remaining days in
December as per the previous motion to come up with the remaining
balance of $35,000.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION DIED FOR LACK OF A SECOND

MOTION PASSED 8-1, Freeman “no.”
