Mr. Lait: There's limitations on establishing office. On that corridor, I don't
think you can do it.

Vice Mayor Scharff: I just wanted to make sure of that.

Mr. Lait: I'd want to research that.

Mayor Burt: I think last light, Council Member Holman.

Council Member Holman: Could you repeat what you just said?

Mr. Lait: I just would have to look at it. Let's see. In the RT-35 zone,
offices are permitted. There's a list of restrictions that talk about the 5,000-
square-foot limitation.

Council Member Holman: I think what you're looking for is on Page 91, isn't
it? For Homer/Emerson, is that what you're looking for?

Mr. Lait: On Page 49 of the SOFA plan, it's got the Homer/Emerson corridor.
You're saying Page 91?

Council Member Holman: Yeah.

Mr. Lait: Let me look at that as well.

Council Member Holman: C-1 then tells what the Homer/Emerson corridor
is.

Mr. Lait: You want the definition of that corridor?

Council Member Holman: Yeah, because that's where we're talking about.

Mr. Lait: The document that I've got, Page 91 is definitions.

Council Member Holman: It's the definition of the Homer/Emerson corridor,
which previously I think you were reading the right place. It talks about
retail being required on those two corridors.

Mr. Lait: There's a definition of the corridor, but I was looking on Page 49 at
the permitted uses for the corridor.

Council Member Holman: Hang on half a second. I didn't mark down what
page this was. Whatever page it's on, it was see protection of specific uses.
I'm sorry I didn't identify the page number.

Mr. Lait: No, no. That's Page 49.
