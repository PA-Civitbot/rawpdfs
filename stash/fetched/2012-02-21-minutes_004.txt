Apartments were grossly misrepresented. He stated it was presented as
housing for very low income residents of Palo Alto, to which the City
contributed half of the funding. He knew a couple of low-income residents
of Palo Alto who were not able to get in there, because the prices were too
high. He heard the price of a studio was $550 and $1,000. He asked how
people with a Social Security income of approximately $1,000 could afford
that kind of housing.      He believed this whole project should be re-
examined by the City.
