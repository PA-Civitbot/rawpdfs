                         TRANSCRIPT
Council Member Holman: I just have a small number of amendments to add
please. That the project should include bird safe design.

Mayor Burt: Sounds good.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to add to the Motion, “incorporate bird safe
design.” (New Part C)

Council Member Holman: While agreed and certainly previously noted that
the Baylands General Design Principles and the scenic corridor are
mentioned in the Staff Report, they're not referenced in the findings or the
Record of Land Use Action. That's where it matters. When this goes back to
the ARB—this is just guidance, not motion. When this goes back to the ARB,
that those things be carefully considered as well as the Baylands master
plant list when it comes to landscaping. Maybe I should put that in the
motion.

Mayor Burt: I should have added—go ahead.          I should have added a
request to evaluate a TDM program.

Council Member Holman: I probably should add to the Motion that                  the
Baylands master plant list be considered in the landscape plan, that             the
Baylands General Design Principles be considered in the project design           and
included in the Record of Land Use Action as well as the impacts on              the
Embarcadero Road scenic corridor.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to add to the Motion, “consider the Baylands
Master Plant List in the landscape design.” (New Part D)

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to add to the Motion, “include the Baylands
General Design Principles in the project design and Record Of Land Use
Action (ROLUA).” (New Part E)

Mayor Burt: I'd like to add the consideration of a TDM program.

Council Member Holman: That's good with me.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to add to the Motion, “include consideration of a
Transportation Demand Management (TDM) program.” (New Part F)
