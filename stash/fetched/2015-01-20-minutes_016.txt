He inquired whether children could be allowed to bike on the sidewalk for
that block. He did not see any crosswalk updates at the end of El Camino
Way.

Mr. Rodriguez reported the City had built a crosswalk with bulb-outs to
extend the sidewalk into the street and installed a pedestrian-activated
flashing beacon system at El Camino Way and James Road. At the El
Camino Way and Meadow Drive intersection, Staff proposed significant
improvements.

Council Member DuBois was referring to the intersection with El Camino
Real.

Mr. Rodriguez stated Staff would texture and improve crosswalk facilities at
the El Camino Way and Meadow Drive intersection.

Council Member DuBois remarked that the El Camino Way to El Camino Real
crosswalk seemed very similar to the one at Churchill Avenue and El Camino
Real.

Mr. Rodriguez explained that if the Council approved the Concept Plan Line,
then Staff would immediately enter into contract negotiations with Caltrans
to improve the intersection. Staff wanted to design that intersection with
the intersection at Charleston/Arastradero Road.

Council Member DuBois requested Staff respond to public comment
regarding the crosswalk at Gunn High School.

Mr. Rodriguez noted hundreds of kids used the crossing at Georgia Avenue
to the Gunn Spur Path daily. A raised crosswalk would reduce speeds of
both cars and bicyclists.

Council Member DuBois asked if side paths along Churchill Avenue were
located on PAUSD property.

Mr. Rodriguez answered yes.     The City would need PAUSD approval to
encroach on its property.

Council Member DuBois inquired whether improvements could be refined or
changed after implementation.

Mr. Rodriguez advised that changes would occur in the design phase. The
City could change striping and signage after construction. Curb and gutter
changes were more costly and harder to change after the design phase.
