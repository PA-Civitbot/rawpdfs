was picked up and the recycle bins had to be put on the streets.         She
wondered if alleys could be used for recycle bins also.

Council Member Kishimoto spoke regarding the Fiber to the Home Trial
(FTTH) and the equipment that Motorola would not pick up and asked if the
item would return to the Council.

Mr. Benest noted staff would look into the issue and the exact date the trial
would end.

Council Member Kishimoto noted the Valley Transportation Authority (VTA)
scenarios were to be voted on by the VTA Board on Thursday, October 20,
2005. Recent numbers increased the BART to San Jose costs by $450
million, which did not show equal sacrifice between projects.

Council Member Cordell noted her frustrations and concern regarding the
community garden fee increases.

Mayor Burch announced Council Member Kishimoto’s appointment as Santa
Clara County Cities Association’s representative to the Bay Area Air Quality
Management District.
