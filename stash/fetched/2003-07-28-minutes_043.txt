Council Member Lytle asked whether it would be alright if there was an
office for the building or an office that provided services to residences
of the building.

Ms. Furth asked whether they would separate out the 100 percent
affordable category that was being treated as a separate conceptual
category with an unlimited FAR.

Council Member Lytle said also if that was included, it would not be
100 percent but 98 percent.

Ms. Furth said 100 percent of the residential units in the project could
be affordable, and there could be incidental uses that would not be
considered as separate uses under the zoning. Council Member
Kishimoto said the 100 percent rental could have the same incidental
small retail or social service.

Council Member Lytle said it would have to meet the same criteria as
some use of the occupancy whether it was the social service
occupancy or housing occupancy.

Ms. Furth asked whether the FAR limit in the RT-35 would apply to all
uses or not to100 percent affordable residential.

Council Member Kishimoto said that was to keep it for 1.5 for all the
uses.

Ms. Furth asked whether the FAR amount for the unlimited residential
was RT-50 only. The heightened daylight plane requirements would
apply for both.

Council Member Freeman said item b would stay the same and item c
would change from no FAR to 2.0 FAR.

Council Member Kishimoto said the exception was 100 percent BMR.
The proposal would be 100 percent BMR so the Council could set the
FAR limit.

Council Member Lytle said there had been discussion in the Housing
Element where a motion to re-enforce that the 50-foot height limit was
not supported. A variance could be granted to the heightened daylight
plane. She wanted to see an FAR limit and a 2.0 FAR was a reasonable
limit. It should be transitioning down as it moved away from the
Central business district.
