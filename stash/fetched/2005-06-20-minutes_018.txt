In addition, staff had proposed changes to their work plan due to the projected
layoffs in the Information Technology (IT) Division.

Council Member Freeman asked whether doubling would be less rapid than it
had been in the past.

Mr. Yeats said yes it would when going from zero.

Council Member Freeman said the figures in front of her went from $60,000 to
$120,000.

Mr. Yeats said in 2003-04, the actual allocated charges were $87,000, and
would be $60,000 in 2004-05.

Council Member Freeman said the allocated charges were $120,000 in 2006-07.

Mr. Yeats said in 2006-07, the Technology Fund would revert back to its past
funding level.

Council Member Freeman expressed concern over the lack of benchmarks for
the manager of Economic Development position. She believed it was needed to
see whether it had accomplished the goals that were set out. She understood
there was one such position in the City Manager’s office.

Mr. Benest said that was correct.

Council Member Freeman asked whether the salary and benefits for the one
Economic Development Manager was $202,516.

Mr. Yeats said it was actually the salary allocation for 1.15 persons. There was
presently an administrative staff person being allocated to that function as well.

Council Member Freeman agreed with the SEIU person who stated it was not
the fault of the employees that health benefits had soared; however, something
needed to be done. The City could either reduce the number of employees or
restructure staff through reclassification. She expressed her opposition to the
City Manager’s Office budget.

Council Member Ojakian said the assumption that the title of manager meant
someone reported to you was fallacious. Sometimes a person managed people,
and other times a person managed projects. He clarified the benchmark for the
Economic Development staff person was located on page 88 of the Adopted
Budget under Effectiveness.

Council Member Freeman said she stood corrected.
