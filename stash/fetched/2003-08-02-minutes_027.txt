were changed to RT-35, or how much housing would there be if the
property were left RT-50.

Council Member Freeman referred to the Working Group
recommendation and clarified the Public Facilities (PF) zone was
currently PF.

Mr. Emslie said that was correct.

Council Member Freeman clarified the PF would be changed to RT-50.

Mr. Emslie said that was correct.

Council Member Lytle said the Council had not made the findings for
converting a PF zone to a housing designation. The findings, in State
law, were the City had a surplus of public land to comfortably afford to
give up for utilities and public facilities. The Council was not in a
position for that.

Mr. Emslie said the area subject to the change to RT-50 included only
one area that would potentially redevelop, which was the Ole’s site.
The other sites were historic or built out to close to 2.0 FAR. The delta
of Ole’s would be the difference between RT-50 and RT-35, which
meant three or four units would be lost.

Council Member Lytle suggested using the Working Group
recommendation plus Ole’s, so the three or four units were not lost.

Mr. Benest reminded the Council the substation site was in the
Housing Element as a designated site for housing. The Council took a
policy direction in terms of identifying a preferred site.

Ms. Furth said Council Member Lytle referred to rules about disposition
of public property. Staff would look into whether the Council could
make the change because the change made the property consistent
with the Housing Element.

Council Member Kleinberg clarified rezoning could be made contingent
upon confirmation on the appropriate next step with compatibility of
the Housing Element.

Ms. Furth said that was correct, and staff would advise the Council
about other steps necessary before changing City property, which was
leased to utilities, to another use.
