only slightly greater, but when an acid extraction test was performed more
was coming out than before.

Mayor Kishimoto asked whether this was happening to other Wastewater
Treatment Plants.

Mr. Bobel stated it is California and we have an incinerator, which makes us
unique. This copper rule is applied only in California. Nationally, there is no
hazardous waste limit for copper.

Mayor Kishimoto asked whether Palo Alto is one of the few Wastewater
Treatment Plants that does incinerate.

Mr. Bobel stated that was correct and the plants that do incinerate are all
experiencing this problem.

Mayor Kishimoto stated East Palo Alto would suffer the most with the copper
being emitted into the air but this contract is for transport of the ash not the
copper emissions.

Council Member Morton asked whether more information would be available
in a week or so.

Mr. Benest stated there would be specific information available from East
Palo Alto and whether there is a second response for the bid.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION PASSED 7-2 Barton, Beecham no.

Council Member Kleinberg clarified her no vote for number 15 was because
the City should not be paying for this luxury. This work should be done by
the City.
