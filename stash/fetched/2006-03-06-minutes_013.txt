allowed. His understanding was that had been done in other cities in the state.
The requirement for occupancy should be revisited.

MOTION: Council Member Morton moved, seconded by Kishimoto, to approve
and authorize the amendment to the 2005-2006 Annual Action Plan of the 2005-
2010 Consolidated Plan, as follows:
     1.    Approve and authorize the allocation of funds in the amount of
           $900,000 from the existing Community Development Block
           Grant (CDBG) housing development fund to the Community
           Working Group for the acquisition of the Alma Street Apartments
           located at 2507-2533 Alma Street.
     2.    Approve and authorize the allocation of $250,000 from the next
           Fiscal Year (2006/2007) CDBG grant allocation for the
           acquisition of the Alma Street Apartments.
     3.    Approve and authorize the City Manager or his designee to
           execute the attached agreement in the amount of $1,150,000
           with the Community Working Group for the acquisition of the
           Alma Street Apartments.
     4.    Adopt Budget Amendment Ordinance 4896 to transfer $250,000
           from the City Commercial Housing fund to the CDBG housing
           development fund in order to carry out acquisition of the Alma
           Street Apartments.
     5.    Authorize the City Manager to request $250,000 in fiscal year
           2006/2007 CDBG funds from the Department of Housing and
           Urban Development in order to reimburse the City Commercial
           Housing Fund.

      Furthermore, when the permanent arrangement for financing is worked
      out, staff would return to Council with a measure to ensure the property
      remains low income housing as long as possible.

Council Member Beecham clarified the City needed to expend funds by April 30,
2006, and the change made by the Council would not inhibit that.

Mr. Emslie said that was correct.

Council Member Klein asked what would happen to the present tenants in the
building.

Mr. Barr said letters would be sent informing the tenants of the possible
purchase by CWG and their rights under federal regulations. Relocating tenants
was not expected but if that happened, it would be done under the protection of
the federal relocation laws.

MOTION PASSED 7-0, Barton, Cordell not participating.
