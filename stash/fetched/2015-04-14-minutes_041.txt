Ms. Stump reported the Council's proposal was to accept the vast majority of
the elements addressed by the Hearing Officer in the same manner that he
addressed them with some modifications. It was logical to approve that
decision with modifications.

Vice Mayor Schmid read the Motion as amended.

Mayor Holman indicated Staff would work with counsel for the park owner
and Residents Association to determine an alternate date.

Ms. Stump would work with the parties and Mr. Beccaria to determine a date
as soon after May 4 as possible.

Council Member Filseth noted the term "community amenities" did not
appear in the discussion of appraisal in the Ordinance. It appeared in the
discussion of comparable mobile home park and comparable housing. He
inquired whether the language in the Motion modified the definitions of
comparable mobile home park and comparable housing in the Ordinance.

Ms. Stump understood the concern was to ensure an appraisal was
performed as the Ordinance referred to it.

Mr. Beccaria explained that the appraisal methodology was called the scope
of work. He offered language of "the appraiser will revise the scope of work
to include safety and schools." In that manner, the language was directed
toward the appraiser.

MOTION AS AMENDED PASSED: 9-0

Adjournment: The meeting was adjourned at 11:28 P.M.
