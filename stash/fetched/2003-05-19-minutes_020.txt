Mr. Kott said Homer Avenue would become a two-way operation.

Council Member Freeman asked that a jog be considered to Channing
Avenue.

Mr. Kott replied the jog would be considered in the interest of safety.

Council Member Morton would not support the motion.

Vice Mayor Beecham said staff explained the priorities of the items that
would go forward for which money was found.

AMENDMENT: Vice Mayor Beecham moved, seconded by Council Member
Ojakian, to revert to the staff recommendation to eliminate sidewalk
bikeway paths from the City's bikeway network and remove existing signs
where they exist.

Mayor Mossar requested a vote on the amendment.

Council Member Lytle       questioned    the   difference   between   the   two
recommendations.

Mr. Kott responded that staff would complete the projects as quickly and
safely as possible.

Council Member Morton questioned that elimination of sidewalk use for
bicycles would force students onto busy roads.

Mr. Kott said the signs indicated a sidewalk bike path would be removed;
however, sidewalks could still be used for cycling. Adept cyclists would use
busy roads and younger school children would be educated about safer road
alternatives.

Mayor Mossar stated the City of Palo Alto did not want sidewalks as part of
its official bicycle network.

Council Member Freeman said the phased-in approach seemed safer for
school children.

Mr. Kott replied sidewalk bike paths were not safe and the City should not
represent them as safe.

Council Member Freeman said alternate routes were not as direct as the
busy road route. The amendment stated the Cityâ€™s position was that it was
unsafe for anyone to ride on sidewalks.
