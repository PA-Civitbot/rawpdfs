Council Member Shepherd stated the Palo Alto Neighborhoods (PAN) had
been able to secure grants and volunteers; however, they were in need of
$20,000 to complete their Emergency Preparedness Program.

MOTION: Council Member Shepherd moved, seconded by Council Member
Scharff to accept the Palo Alto Neighborhoods proposal to fund the Block
Coordinator Program with $20,000.

Mayor Burt clarified that the Motion was to fund the PAN Emergency Block
Preparedness Coordinator Position for $20,000.

Mr. Keene stated $20,000 would fund PAN’s operations and supplies, and
would not support a coordinator position.

Council Member Scharff stated one of the City Council’s top priorities was
emergency preparedness. He felt the Motion was an excellent use of City
funds.

Vice Mayor Espinosa inquired whether there was a proposal from PAN on
how the requested funds would be spent.

Ms. Morariu stated PAN submitted a proposal which included ongoing and
one-time expenses for their Block Coordinator Program. The items included
vests, identification cards, whistles, copying expenses, annual recognition
events, signage, magnets, radios, and community bulletin boards.

Vice Mayor Espinosa stated, considering the priority on emergency
preparedness, why funding the Block Coordinator Program was not included
in the City’s Budget.

Ms. Morariu stated PAN’s proposal was received subsequent to the
preparation of the City’s Budget.

Council Member Holman stated it was her belief that PAN indicated they
could manage on a budget of $10,000.

Ms. Morariu stated PAN identified $6,600 in one-time expenses. She stated
$20,000 included funding for ongoing expenses.

Council Member Holman suggested that $10,000 be allocated from the
General Fund, and $10,000 be allocated from the Council Contingency Fund.

Mr. Keene stated the City Council had the discretion to allocate funding from
the Council Contingency Fund.
