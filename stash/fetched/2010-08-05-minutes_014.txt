Council Member Schmid asked if there would be a problem in moving
forward without Stanfordâ€™s participation.

Mr. Emslie said that could be a possibility and suggested the HSR Committee
convey that to Stanford.

Council Member Klein said there was anticipation for the HSR to release the
requirements for a station and now was in a position to schedule a meeting
with the Council in September or October to see if Palo Alto wanted to be a
location for a HSR station.

Mr. Emslie said the Authority had scheduled a meeting with Staff which
would be the formal transmittal of the criteria and a Study Session would
need to be scheduled.

Council Member Klein said the tentative price tag for preliminary release of
3,000 parking spaces was $150 million which the Authority was looking for
the community to provide.

Council Member Price asked if the California Avenue and Downtown Palo Alto
stations were being considered for a HSR stations.

Mr. Emslie said the Downtown station was the only station for consideration
because of the high ridership numbers.

Council Member Price asked if the parking models would need to be on site
or in close proximity to the station.

Mr. Emslie said the Authority indicated within three miles.

Session and an Action item needed to be scheduled to include the
Alternatives Analysis and station criteria.
