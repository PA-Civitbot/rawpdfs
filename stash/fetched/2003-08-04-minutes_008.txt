AMENDMENT: Mayor Mossar moved, seconded by Morton, to additionally
direct the CAO Committee to hire an outside recruiter to assist in recruiting
and assist the Council with the process of other phases of the recruitment to
be brought back to the full Council for confirmation.

AMENDMENT PASSED 7-2, Kleinberg, Ojakian “no.”

Mayor Mossar said the recruiter would work with the Council and the Blue
Ribbon Panel Task Force for recommendations as to who the best candidates
were.

Council Member Lytle wanted to verify the Blue Ribbon Committee would be
a separate entity from the Council. She preferred the full council be
involved in equal ways in the recruitment process.

Mayor Mossar asked Council Member Lytle to explain how the Blue Ribbon
Panel would work with the Council.

Council Member Lytle said the Blue Ribbon Panel would be another advisory
group to the Council from another area of expertise. There would be two
independent sources of recommendations.

Mayor Mossar said the CAO Committee would choose a recruiter. A recruiter
would work with the CAO -Committee to specify the timeline and the specific
process, then would bring the process back to full Council for confirmation
and the details of the working relationship with the Blue Ribbon Task Force.

Council Member Lytle said a word should be modified to allow new Council
Member elect members to be allowed to comment.

Mayor Mossar said she did not have that understanding.

Council Member Lytle explained the wording in the Colleagues’ Memo would
only allow an incumbent to comment or vote.

Mayor Mossar said Council Member Lytle could make an amendment to the
language.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION BY THE MAKER AND SECONDER
to make a change to page 2 of the Colleagues’ Memo to remove from the
bullet the words “comment or.”

Council Member Lytle said if a change would take place, the vote would take
place with the new Council.
