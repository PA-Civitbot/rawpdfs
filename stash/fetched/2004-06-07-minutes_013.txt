Pearson but had spoken to leaders and members of the community who also
had tremendous affinity for the Preserve. Some were dismayed the property

much to do with the property. She did not support the main motion or
naming the gateway after Ms. Pearson.

Preserve would be honoring Ms. Pearson but in common plain usage would
still be referred to as the Arastradero Preserve.

Council Member Freeman supported the main motion.

main motion.

Mayor Beecham supported the main motion and opposed the substitute
motion.
