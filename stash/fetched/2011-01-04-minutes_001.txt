SPECIAL ORDERS OF THE DAY

Mayor Burt welcomed everyone and recognized former Palo Alto Mayors,
Council Members, and various members from local government
representative offices.

1.    Election of Mayor and Vice Mayor.

MOTION: Council Member Klein nominated Vice Mayor Espinosa for Mayor,
seconded by Council Member Schmid

Council Member Klein stated he was very pleased to nominate Sid Espinosa
to be the next Mayor. He stated that ice Mayor Espinosa went to Wesleyan
University where he was now an Alumni Trustee, meaning that he was
elected by his fellow Alumni to the Wesleyan Board of Trustees. He then
went to the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University and had
worked for the Justice Department where he served as a close personal aide
to then Attorney General, Janet Reno. He then took a job with HP as their
Director of Philanthropy, and then moved on to become the Director of
Citizenship for Microsoft. He takes a very careful independent look at issues
and then speaks very eloquently as to what his position is and why we ought
to join him. I think Sid has been a very careful, an analyst of the issues that
we have had before us and has done a superb job in the time he has been
on the Council.
