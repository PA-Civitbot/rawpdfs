Roland Lebrun spoke regarding Caltrain and county parks. Plan A for
Caltrain should be a procurement approach similar to that of airlines which
would keep $440 million here in California rather than paying a foreign
manufacturer to build the trains. 25 percent of the California park system
has been turned over to the conservation plan. The Palo Alto parks were
going to be used to widen Highway 101. The parks belong to Palo Alto not
to the county and should not be used that way.

Herb Borock spoke regarding the High Speed Rail. He discussed a long
history of speed tests that seemed to be going backwards instead of forward
and provided documentation to Council.
