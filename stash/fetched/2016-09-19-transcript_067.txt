Council Member DuBois:       Pedestrians going north on El Camino, yeah, on
the east side.

Mr. Mello: Which Page of the Staff Report is that?

Council Member DuBois: It's 379. It's a graph again. It looks exactly like
this.

Mr. Mello: It's the traffic report.

Council Member DuBois: It's this slide in the report.

Mr. Mello:   I have that, but where is the conflicting number in the Staff
Report?

Council Member DuBois: This number is different from the number in the
packet on the same chart. It's this one, existing ped and bike volumes.

Mr. Mello: We can continue to look for that.

Council Member DuBois: Page 11 of the Hexagon report.

Mayor Burt: How about we let them look while you go onto your next
question. They asked for that, Tom. Go ahead.

Council Member DuBois: Do you see what I'm referring to?

Mayor Burt: Josh, if you want to loop back to ...

Mr. Mello: I do. I see the typo. I can't tell you which one is the accurate

Council Member DuBois: It's kind of a big difference, the whole thing about
a lot of peds crossing there, and it goes away depending on which number is
right.

Mr. Mello:     The crossing conflict is actually on the north leg of the
intersection, not the east leg.

Council Member DuBois: The north leg. I'm looking at the ...

Mr. Mello: Across El Camino, between the northeast and the northwest
corner, that's the movement that has the conflicts with the right-turning
vehicles coming off Embarcadero.

Council Member DuBois: That's 20 pedestrians?
