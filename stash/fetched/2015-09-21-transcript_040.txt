existing businesses that may not be retail or didn't have that requirement,
how do we get them to comply when they're legal nonconforming?

Council Member DuBois: I guess, for retail is that required?

Mr. Lait: Yeah. On Cal. Ave., we have the pedestrian overlay, so a new use
coming in would have to meet those pedestrian requirements. We do have
kind of a ongoing issue that we're trying to address now having to deal with
sort of on the inside of a building, curtains. It's an ongoing issue that we're
looking at right now.

Council Member DuBois: Looking at this map on Page 7, I guess, the one
that excludes the zone and doesn't exclude. Maybe you could just tell me—
there's one here that's just a blank white space. What is that one?

Vice Mayor Schmid: Post office.

Council Member DuBois: On Cambridge, right in the middle.

Mr. Lait: ... at the PF zone or across the street from the PF zone?             The

Vice Mayor Schmid: Post office.

Council Member DuBois: It's not a ... Sort of about where your mouse was

Mr. Lait: This area?

Council Member DuBois:        That's a parking lot.   The next one down.      That
right there.

Mr. Lait: The one I'm on right now is a PC zoned parcel. That is 420
Cambridge. That's existing PC zoning. I believe this parcel—I mean, I
believe that's the Post Office.

Council Member DuBois:            The notch at Park Boulevard, looks like the
Courtyard.
