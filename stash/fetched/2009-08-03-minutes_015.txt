Mr. Ramberg stated the 7.75 percent rate of return assumption was the rate
built into the CERBT for long-term planning.

Council Member Burt asked whether the presentation being presented to
Council was being presented to the Unions during negotiations. He stated it
would give a better understanding of the budget.

Mr. Keene stated with Council direction the document would be shared with
the Unions, however; the general approach was to share the state of the city
as widely as possible.

Vice Mayor Morton asked for clarification on the pre-paid assets on the
balance sheet.

Ms. Eikenberry stated when the Annual Required Contribution (ARC) was
overfunded, it was considered a net Other Post Employee Benefit (OPEB)
asset which was on the balance sheet whereas when the ARC was
underfunded, it was considered a net OPEB liability. She stated when the
funds were utilized from the CERBT for an ARC it lowered the net OPEB
asset.

Vice Mayor Morton asked when the overfunding occurred.

Ms. Eikenberry stated in the first year there was five million put in and the
ARC was nine million.

Vice Mayor Morton stated the ARC was booked as a liability and a net asset,
the same Fund could not be used for both.

Ms. Eikenberry stated GASBY45 and the CERBT rules were separate, the only
portion shown for the CERBT was the annual required expense. When the
CERBT was funded, the cash was removed and shown as an offset to the net
OPEB assets.

Council Member Yeh asked whether the City was precluded from issuing any
debt to fund the liability with regard to the CalPERS debt.

Ms. Eikenberry stated if the City determined to stop the use of the CERBT,
the funds would remain in the irrevocable Trust. The funds would be
available to us for retiree medical. She stated the option was available to
issue debt or open a trust with another party.

Council Member Yeh asked whether debt revenue could be used to fund the
CERBT.
