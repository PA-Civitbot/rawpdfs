Before I shift to a discussion about the Council’s priorities and key initiatives for the

coming year, I want to talk for a few minutes about the City’s comprehensive plan and

hopefully clear up the confusion that seems to be swirling about the January 30th

Council meeting. The Comprehensive Plan (or comp plan) is the overarching policy

document that provides long term guidance for development and land use decisions in

the City. The last comprehensive plan was completed in 1998, almost a generation ago

and this new plan will probably inform development decisions that will impact the next

generation.




At the January 30 meeting, City staff and members of the Citizens Advisory Committee,

brought forward over 30 questions to the Council regarding how to proceed on various

difficult policy issues in the Comp Plan. I want to take a moment to commend the hard

work the Citizens Advisory Committee has completed over the past two years. The

CAC has done an excellent job sending forward goals, policies and programs for the

Council’s review and their input is valued and has been and will continue to be

extensively used. The Council devoted the entire evening on January 30 to answering

the lingering questions from this Committee and staff. The Council, at a high level,

provided direction to maintain the status quo on almost all issues, including on the 50-

foot height limit, the 50,000-square foot per year cap on office development, and the

overall development cap for the City.




I could go back and review each vote the Council took on the comp plan that night and

explain them but then this would be like a council meeting and we would be here until

                                            8
