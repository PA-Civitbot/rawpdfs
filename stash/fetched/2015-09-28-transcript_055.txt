Council Member DuBois: Can we also just change that first line? Instead of
saying "we don't accept the consultant's report," just that "we request an
update to the consultant's report."

Council Member Scharff: Yes.

Council Member DuBois:      Council requests an update to the consultant's

Mayor Holman:       Okay.    Does this mean that you are accepting the
amendment?

Council Member DuBois: Yeah.

Mayor Holman: Council Member Burt?

Council Member Burt: Yes.

consultant’s report including:”

Mayor Holman: Council Member Scharff, do you have any more?

Council Member Scharff: No, I think that's what I had.

Mayor Holman: I had a light from Council Member Kniss.         Do you care to

Council Member DuBois: The reason it's fast is because later on we're
saying let's go talk to Google and AT&T now before these decisions come
out. Yes, it is fast, but things are happening fast.
