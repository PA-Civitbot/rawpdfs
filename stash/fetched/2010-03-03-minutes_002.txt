The Council and Commission discussed the various issues extensively,
including but not limited to the following general observations (and not
intended to represent a consensus):
     Most of the projects built under the current Plan, and those in south
      Palo Alto in particular, have been "neighborhood resistant;" the City
      should look at LEED-ND (Leadership in Energy and Environmental
      Design - Neighborhood Development) as a possible guideline for new
      growth; and the work effort should be more than an "amendment;"

     The City should challenge the ABAG assumptions with respect to
      impacts on greenhouse gases, water conservation, etc., of increased
      development, especially for housing;

     The City's approach to the housing element should be a "bottoms-up"
      methodology to define what we can do, building on what is already
      realistic and zoned, not a directive to find a way to meet the ABAG
      RHNA housing allocations;

     The follow-up session should be treated as an action item (not a study
      session) so that votes may be taken to provide direction;

     The South El Camino Real Design Guidelines and associated Comp Plan
      policies and zoning codes should be considered and updated in the
      short term rather than awaiting completion of the Comp Plan effort;

     There is a need to reconcile inconsistent vision statements and
      policies, and for some reformatting to make the Plan more user-
      friendly; and to provide more practical and "operational" statements
      and policies;

     Area plans should be a more frequently-used tool than has been the
      case, to guide development;

     The City should evaluate the potential for litigation if the City does not
      comply with housing element law, as well as preemptive measures to
      challenge those regulations;

     The City should deal with the housing element issues before acting on
      the Stanford project or the concept plans;

     The housing element should address the difficulty of providing
      "moderate income" units and the fact that the City was over its total
      housing allocation for the prior period with no "credit" for that; and
      that the City already has provided pedestrian-transit oriented zoning in
      advance of ABAG projections and SB375; and that ABAG should
      consider the least-cost methods for meeting greenhouse gas
      objectives;
