specific standard. Yeah, you could say, "I don't like the color of the house."
That would go through the process.

Council Member Kniss: Who's paying what?

Mr. Lait: The person who is requesting the hearing—you build your house.
The neighbor doesn't like the color of your house. The neighbor has to pay
the fee for the director's hearing.

Council Member Kniss: The entire fee?

Mr. Lait: Yeah. That's the $1,192, I believe, or something like that.

Council Member Kniss: Tell me where it is. I didn't see it. What page are
you on?

Mayor Burt: (inaudible)

Council Member Kniss: I don't know. That's what I'm trying to find out.

Mr. Lait: That's right.

Council Member Kniss: In the middle where it says director's approval?

Mr. Lait: As the Mayor said, it's Packet Page 95, director's approval. It's the
third row in that section. It's a new fee. For a Director hearing requested,
it's $1,186.

Council Member Kniss: What we need to know, so that it's on the record
somewhere—this is your next door neighbor who doesn't like something
about your house. You're saying they will pay for it? You've got two
different fees. You've got the now fee and the 2018 fee. Who's paying
$2,300?

Mr. Lait: The person who is requesting ...

Council Member Kniss: The hearing.

Mr. Lait: ... the hearing.

Council Member Kniss: Pat's going to pay to have you hear about my house,
correct?

Mr. Lait: Yes, in that scenario.

Council Member Kniss: That's what I needed to know. Thanks.
