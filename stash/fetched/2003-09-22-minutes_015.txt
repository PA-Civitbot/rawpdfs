problem. The performance measures were not regulatory, but rather
a goal.

Betsy Allyn, 4186 Willmar Drive, said the Greenacres Community
supported the objectives and performance measures recommended by
the staff for the Charleston/Arastradero study.

RECESS: 9:42 p.m. to 9:40 p.m.

MOTION: Vice Mayor Beecham moved, seconded by Morton, to accept
the   Planning    and    Transportation Commission     and   staff
recommendation to approve the proposed Charleston/Arastradero
Road Corridor Plan Performance Measures contained in Attachment A
of CMR:430:03.

Vice Mayor Beecham said he was comfortable with staff going forward
with those objectives and performance measures.

Council Member Morton asked the maker of the motion to accept a
modification. Measure 1 and 2 needed an adjective such as, “no
significant increase” in both sentences.

Mayor Mossar asked if the maker of the motion would accept the
change.

Vice Mayor Beecham said he would not accept the amendment.

Council Member Morton asked the staff what the imposition of a word
would do.

Mr. Emslie said the word “significant” adds more clarity.

Mr. Kott suggested the word “minimize” instead of “significant” when
referring to traffic.

Ms. Cassel said that measures were being worked on with the
California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) standards.

Council Member Morton asked if the maker would accept the word
“minimize.”

Vice Mayor Beecham said no.
