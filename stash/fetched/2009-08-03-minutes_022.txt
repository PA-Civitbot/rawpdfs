transmission depending on the location renewables being built to get the
energy to the load centers.

Council Member Espinosa asked for a sense of whether the City would be
reaching its goals in the years to come.

Mr. Kabat stated there were negotiations being conducted with enough
providers to reach the goals; however, he estimated with the prices being
presented it would likely go beyond the one-half cent rate impact.

Council Member Espinosa asked the number of years it would take to reach
that goal.

Mr. Kabat stated the next goal being focused on was the single point of year
2012 in trying to get to thirty percent.

Vice Mayor Morton stated he did not support the Substitute Motion.

Council Member Yeh stated he did not support the Substitute Motion. He
stated the Agreement provided a safety mechanism in the transfer of rights
of participants; Palo Alto could sell its power to the other NCPA participants
or to the full market if there were no interested participants.

Mr. Kabat stated since it was not financed with tax exempt funds the power
could be sold to the full market.

Council Member Yeh stated there was flexibility in the Agreement, if for
example the Agreement had a rate impact on Palo Alto there was the clause
in the Agreement to access others who could purchase the power.

Council Member Schmid stated the question needing to be asked was if this
was the best investment of funds or were there other alternatives which
could get us further down the road in a more efficient and effective manner.

Council Member Burt stated he did not propose discontinuing with the
Agreement, he was only suggesting not doubling the bet.
