Kat Kohlsaat, 331 Poe Street, concurred with Ms. Soul's comments.

Lenore Jones, Chair of the Library Commission, 3465 Kenneth Drive, said the
Library Advisory Commission (LAC) had not had the opportunity to discuss
the issue of extending service hours at the Downtown Library. While she
agreed with the comments expressed that evening, she would like to see a
coordinated solution of improvements for the entire City library system
rather than a piecemeal approach.

Mayor Beecham declared the Public Hearing closed at 8:30 p.m.

Director of Libraries Paula Simpson said while she appreciated the Council’s
consideration of putting scarce dollars into the library, she had two concerns
about the issue coming at that time. First, expanding hours of service at the
Downtown Library was not necessarily the current top priority. She asked
the Council for more time to assess the City’s library needs systemwide
before making or endorsing any decisions about library service hours.
Secondly, she echoed the concern of Lenore Jones that the LAC had not met
to review the issue and provide the Council with recommendations.
