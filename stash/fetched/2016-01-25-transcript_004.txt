because we know that our long-term stewardship of the land is based on the
future generations having the same values. There's a lot of emphasis on
diversity, working with Latino Outdoors, so diversity, youth, and health.
There's a lot of important partners that we work with. I just wanted to point
out that we have a great website of course. There's a lot of great docent
walks if you wanted to join us. Midpen. is on the move, and I hope you all
join us out in the preserve as well. Thank you. If there's any questions, I'm
happy to take them.

Mayor Burt: Council Member Kniss.

Council Member Kniss: Hi, Yoriko.

Ms. Kishimoto: I will be happy to get back to you.

Council Member Kniss: Thanks.

Mayor Burt: Council Member Holman.

Council Member Holman: Yes, thank you. Yoriko, if you could go back to
the partnership slide please. I don't remember the discussions that took
