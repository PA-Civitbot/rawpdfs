would be to follow-up on 2006 commitments on libraries, public safety
buildings and emergency planning. The City should be in a position to
fund new community facilities with a trimmer budget. The draft for the
Cityâ€™s emergency plan would be reviewed in February 2007. There was
work to do with partners in the region to align the twin goals that have
been in process for many years. Sustainable economic development
and budget, along with the commitment to the highest environmental
standards and a walkable community, would be the goal. A green
economy could be build through innovation to ensure our beautiful
valley would continue to flourish for several more generations.
