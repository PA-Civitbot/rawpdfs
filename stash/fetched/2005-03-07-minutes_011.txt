Bob Carlstead, 147 Walter Hays Street, said Palo Alto invested $6 million to
upgrade the Golf Course. Palo Alto citizens owned the course and money
would be returned to the City for 45 years. The plan would negate the $6
million investment. Golfer’s fees would increase if the course were upgraded
to an executive course. Stanford had an executive golf course, which cost
$100 to play a round of golf.     He suggested placing soccer fields on the
landfill area when it closed in 2011. He urged Council to not approve the
proposal.

Betsy Allyn, Willmar Drive, said creating playing fields would be a great
contribution to the children, as the Palo Alto population grew and would last
longer than 50 years.

Tom Jordan, 474 Churchill Avenue, supported the proposal. He said the City
would gain access to substantial amounts of money in the area of flood
control and overflow rights.

Sharon Oliver, 823 Gailen Avenue, did not support the motion. She said the
Golf Course contributed to the General Fund for 50 years, and to rebuild and
replace it with soccer fields would be too costly.

Janice Hough, 189 Bryant Street, stated she supported the motion. She
spoke of children’s obesity being a national problem. The redesign would
contribute to more playing fields and encourage children to participate in
sports.

Michael Closson said the redesign should include enhancement of the natural
environment of the area. He supported the proposal.

Mike Krigel, 739 LaPara Avenue, spoke regarding the need for baseball
fields.

Donald M. Hughes, 1824 Oak Creek Drive, echoed Mr. Carlstead’s comments
and suggested placing soccer fields on the landfill area with when it closed in
2011.

Herb Borock, P.O. Box 632, spoke of spending funds to complete and
develop parks located in the flatlands such as Greer Park and Heritage Park.
The proposal was in addition to the proposal for the Mayfield playing fields
