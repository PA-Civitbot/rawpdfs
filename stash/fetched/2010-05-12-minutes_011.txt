Mayor Burt reiterated that the Housing Element was being continued for
further discussion for the items which had not yet been discussed at this
evenings meeting.

Council Member Shepherd asked when the discussion of the strategic
planning for the corridor study would be occurring.

Mayor Burt clarified the discussion was currently addressing the
Comprehensive Plan and the Housing Element although the question asked
was on the Alternatives Analysis for the corridor study.

Council Member Scharff requested discussing the construction of affordable
units this evening. He felt the issue needed minimal further discussion and
could be resolved without waiting.

Council Member Price stated she understood the difference between the
Alternatives Analysis and corridor study in short-term and long-term. She
noted the item was time sensitive and there needed to be a clear
understanding of when there would be discussion.

Mayor Burt explained the opportunity to discuss all items not covered during
this evenings meeting would be at the upcoming special Council meeting
before the end of June.
