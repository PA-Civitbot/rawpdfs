                      DRAFT MINUTES
Ms. Grider said that for CPAC she would have Staff write sense
minutes, but she did not have the Staff for the CAC.

Mr. Keene said that issue needed to be discussed as the whole
project was not budgeted for 2012. He thought Staff would have
to provide Council with an estimate of what level of support was
needed.

Mayor Yeh thought it should be considered as part of the
transparency efforts. He said that it was an important committee
that would inform the future discussions of the CPAC and both full
elected bodies. He said that for both bodies to benefit from the
CAC he thought it was important. He knew that there were
Council contingency funds that were not fully committed and he
was interested in understanding what the potential costs for
providing sense minutes for the CAC would be.

Council Member Burt suggested they alternate the cost with
PAUSD.

Mayor Yeh suggested the minutes could be cost shared as part of
Guiding Principle Number 1. He stated that he had no changes
for Guiding Principles Number 2, Number 3, or Number 4.
Guiding Principles Number 5 the end of the sentence would read
“which should be open and sympathetic to the interests of the
other party,” in place of “they should be evaluated as equal
priorities.” He stated he heard no changes for Guiding Principle
Number 6. He stated that for Guiding Principle Number 7 he
added “through 2012-2013,” and the language “During or as an
alternative during various phases a cost sharing agreement shall
be developed to the mutual satisfaction of both parties.”

Council Member Price said “to insure fairness to all parties.” She
said that was a similar idea.

Mayor Yeh said there were two alternatives.
