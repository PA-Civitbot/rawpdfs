formerly General Fund employees.

Ms. Erickson said she did not have the figures on hand and would need to
get back with the information.

Council Member Klein asked what the percentage ranking was on satisfaction
of land use decisions in the Planning Department.

Ms. Erickson said consultants did not always provide percentile rankings
because they did not have data to compare or the City was the only
jurisdiction asking for the information.

Council Member Klein said land use was controversial and asked how the
City compared with other jurisdictions.

Ms. Erickson said it depended on how many other jurisdictions asked the
same questions. The City was in the 65 percentile in the land use planning
and code enforcement area.

Council Member Klein asked how did the sworn-officer vacancies in the
Police Department compare to other years.

Ms. Erickson said she would need to get back with that information.

Council Member Klein asked whether there were cities that ranked higher
than Palo Alto.

Ms. Erickson said consultants did not release names of cities that were rated.

Mayor Kleinberg asked whether consultants had control of cities that were
questioned and rated.

Ms. Erickson said they did not but it was any jurisdiction that asked the
same questions.       A fee was required for requesting control on the
jurisdictions rated against the City.
