Council Member Klein said he believed it extended inland for some distance
from the Creek.

Mr. Emslie indicated there may be some compatibility between the easement
and open space use.

Vice Mayor Kishimoto referred to Attachment “C” in the staff report
(CMR:168:06) and referred to “historic waters.”

Mr. Emslie said “historic waters” was the former course of the Creek, which
had been covered over and filled in.

Vice Mayor Kishimoto      asked   whether   that   would   affect   any   future
development.

Mr. Emslie said “historic waters” were not jurisdictional wetlands, while the
designated wetlands of 2.5 acres fell under the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers (Corps) regulations.

Vice Mayor Kishimoto asked where the designated wetlands were located.

Mr. Emslie stated the yellow areas indicated on the map were the designated
wetlands.

Vice Mayor Kishimoto asked whether mitigations were required if changes
were made.

Mr. Emslie said only on the yellow areas.

Vice Mayor Kishimoto clarified the construction cost table consisted of one-
time construction costs versus one year worth of deficits.

Mr. Ramberg said the construction costs table was a one-time snapshot,
which did not assume a construction timeframe. Further refinement was
needed to differentiate when construction ended. Operating and revenue
costs were a one-time cost for an annual period of time.

Mayor Kleinberg asked whether the contract would be valued at $10 million
if the tenant contract payout broke even.

Mr. Yeats said the contracts were multi-year agreements, and some
extended 11 years. They were valued based upon the annual contract
amount. Staff anticipated negotiations.

Mayor Kleinberg asked how the range of $5 million to $10 million varied.
