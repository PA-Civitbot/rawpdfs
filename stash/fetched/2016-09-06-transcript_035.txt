Mayor Burt: We are now ready to continue to what was formerly Item 5,
which is a direction to Staff to proceed with discussions with Pets in Need
regarding animal care services and the construction or rehabilitation of the
animal shelter facility. Mr. Shikada.

Ed Shikada, Assistant City Manager: Thank you, Mr. Mayor, members of the
