Council Member Morton said if the Council walked away from the project,
$725,000 was absorbed and not reimbursed. The wording of the advanced
construction approval indicated the project was a priority. The project did
not depend on State funding. The funding was available only for the
proposed project. The project would tie the City’s bike routes together.

Council Member Kishimoto understood the history was 100 percent of all
advance construction authorizations had been repaid.

Mr. Roberts said for staff to believe the City would not get reimbursed the
next year for the $3 million worth of Federal money, the Council had to
believe there would be zero Federal dollars for transportation improvements
in the Bay Area in the next year.

Ms. Rensi responded the longest theoretical period was six years because
that was the period of an entire Federal reauthorization. The biggest user of
advance construction was the State.
