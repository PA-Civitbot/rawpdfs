AMI for the County which was directly related to housing affordability in
Santa Clara County.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to use full Annual Medium Income (AMI) program
in lieu of CPI formula from 2008 on, which will be brought back to Council at
a later date.

Council Member Morton stated that would mean we would start as of today
with the Medium Income levels as published by the County. Those annual
changes would be the measure of the future appreciation in the housing
contract.

Mr. Emslie stated that was correct.

Council Member Morton asked if we could adopt this policy and leave open
the question of whether it would be a change of AMI or CPI and resolve that
issue depending on future Staff input.

Mayor Klein asked for clarification if we could use AMI for past and future.

Council Member Schmid stated no.

Mayor Klein asked whether we would use CPI up until the date we adopt this
and only use AMI going forward.

Council Member Schmid stated that was correct.

Mr. Emslie stated that Staff understood that they will use AMI as a way to
calculate affordability in the future and CPI would apply to the existing units.

Council Member Morton asked whether it would only be to calculate the CPI
cap.

Mr. Emslie stated it was understood that CPI would be used to calculate the
cap for the bonus program.

Council Member Schmid stated it was his understanding that Association of
Bay Area Government (ABAG) uses the AMI to calculate the income levels.

Mr. Emslie stated that many cities had used this calculation and the problem
was it was subject to radical change and could create unintended
consequences because the income levels in the County did fluctuate
regularly. Staff could return with a formula that was based on AMI.
