SPECIAL ORDERS OF THE DAY

1.    Carl Guardino and Roccie Hill of the Housing Trust of Santa Clara
      County

Roccie Hill said Palo Alto was one of the first cities to come into the Housing
Trust of Santa Clara and $20.3 million dollars was raised in Palo Alto.

Carl Guardino said the money was used to assist families and individuals to
purchase affordable homes.

Ms. Hill said monies were invested in housing for low income families in Palo
Alto and at the Opportunity Center.

Mr. Guardino asked Council to help advertise the Housing Trust to families
and individuals who were interested in becoming first time homebuyers.

Ms. Hill told the Council about a new program launched in November 2002
after the State passed Proposition 46. If the Housing Trust Fund could raise
$2 million, the County would receive $2 million from the State.

Council Member Morton thanked the Housing Trust for their work. He asked
the Housing Trust to contact Project Match because their contribution level
had fallen but an effort should be made to save the residences for senior
citizens.

Mr. Guardino said the Housing Trust assisted Project Match in the past and
they would make an effort to continue that assistance.

Ms. Hill said Project Match put forward an application, which was in process
at that time.

Council Member Lytle said the second largest housing program in the State
was through redevelopment tax increments. Governor Davis was retargeting
those funds. She asked if Housing Trust was in partnership with local
organizations to protest the shifting of funds.

Mr. Guardino said he was concerned about that situation, and there were
meetings scheduled for April 2003 to meet with State representatives.
