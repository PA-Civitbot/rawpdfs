Mr. Freedman stated restoration would provide momentum for fundraising.
Restoration plans were drawn in a way that would allow the Museum to
occupy and utilize the building fairly quickly. Once the Board began building
programs, it would be able to demonstrate to the donor community the use
of the building and its future as a museum.

Mr. Witts reported prospective donors indicated that if the Board could
complete the building, then they would fund the Museum. Because the
Board had always planned in phases, the idea of phased fundraising would
work.

Council Member Holman asked about the source of the $1 million estimate
for repairs at the back of the building.

Mr. Freedman advised that the contractor provided the estimate for that
work.   The actual estimate was in the range of $700,000 prior to
contingencies.

Council Member Burt inquired whether at least one project, the Thoits
project, was already approved but could not proceed without obtaining
TDRs.

Mr. Perez did not know.

Ms. Stump understood a project on University Avenue was approved
contingent upon obtaining TDRs.

Council Member Burt reiterated that the 500 University project had been
approved, but it did not have the TDRs that would allow it to build the
square footage as approved.

Hillary Gitelman, Director of Planning and Community Environment, noted
the project was approved conditioned upon obtaining 10,000 square feet of
TDRs.

Council Member Burt asked if the non-historic wings of the Roth Building
were razed to complete the space for Heritage Park.

Mr. Perez concurred.

Council Member Burt asked if the same repairs would be needed if the
building was returned to the City.

Mr. Ghaemmaghami responded yes.
