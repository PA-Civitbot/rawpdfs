Council Member Kishimoto thought the modified plan was
close to Plan 3, which was reviewed by the Council in March
2002.

Ms. Merkes said Plan 3 was a site planning option in the
feasibility study phase. The required setback was 25 feet
along Middlefield Road.

City Manager Frank Benest said one option during the
feasibility stage was the design with the Community Center
and Library placed back to back. At the conceptual stage,
staff selected the preferred option.

Council Member Kishimoto asked about area being dedicated
to parkland.

Project Planner Tricia Schimpp said the current Library sat
on land that was not dedicated parkland. The Community
Center and park were located on dedicated parkland.

Council Member Freeman asked whether the current Library
was considered a Public Facilities (PF) Zone.

Ms. Schimpp said the entire site, with the current Library,
Community Center, and Mitchell Park were zoned PF. The
Mitigated   Negative  Declaration   indicated  the  current
Library site would become dedicated parkland, which was a
permitted use within the park and PF District.

Council Member Freeman asked whether there was a history
why the parcel that the Library was on was not dedicated
parkland.

Ms. Schimpp said she was unaware of the history.

City Attorney Ariel Calonne said the College Terrace
Library was not on dedicated parkland, which might have
been related to the desire to have a child care center at
that site. Childcare centers are not permitted on parkland.

Council Member Freeman asked whether other      libraries   in
Palo Alto were located on dedicated parkland.

Mr. Calonne said of the park sites he        looked   at,   the
College Terrace Library was not dedicated.

Mayor Ojakian said some libraries were not on parkland.
