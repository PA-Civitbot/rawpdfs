Ms. Ratchye said that was correct.

Council Member Schmid asked whether the 0.18 was a cap.

Ms. Silver said the WSA was based on the 0.18. Another Environmental
Impact Report (EIR) process would need to occur if there was an expansion
of the project that would yield more then the 0.18 mgd.

Council Member Schmid asked whether the City had the right to deny the
project or other projects if the water supply decreased.

Ms. Silver said the City would need to have adequate findings in order to
deny.

Mayor Burt requested clarification as to whether the Council would be
approving at this evening’s meeting the 461,000 gpd allocation.

Ms. Ratchye said she did not think there was an allocated amount being
voted on.

Mayor Burt needed clarification as to what was being voted on.

Ms. Ratchye said the Council was being asked to approve that Palo Alto’s
water supply would be able to accommodate the 0.18 mgd.

Mayor Burt said he was trying to correlate the data on slides 9 and 13 of the
Power Point presentation and asked whether the 461,000 gpd was an
incremental demand of 0.18 or the 0.10.

Ms. Ratchye said the 461,000 included only the 0.10 increment.           The
539,000 gpd was the amount in the WSA.

Mayor Burt asked if the 539,000 gpd reflected the 0.18 mgd.

Ms. Ratchye said it did.

Mayor Burt asked if the 461,000 reflected the 0.10.

Ms. Ratchye said it did.

Mayor Burt noted Stanford said they would have the reductions and only
with the .10 would they be reducing at 5.5 percent per bed or 19 percent
per square foot. He asked Staff if this was the agreement.
