D.        Dental Office Source Control
Since 2000, the RWQCP has partnered with the Mid-
Peninsula Dental Society (MPDS) to educate dentists
about their role in preventing mercury contamination in
San Francisco Bay. RWQCP prepared training
materials, conducted training seminars, made on-site
consultations, and defined voluntary best management
practices (BMPs) to prevent mercury amalgam from
reaching the environment.
In 2004, the RWQCP adopted an ordinance requiring all
owners and operators of dental vacuum suction systems
to install an ISO 11143 certified amalgam separator device by March 31, 2005. The ISO 11143
certification process for amalgam separators includes demonstrating that the separator removes a
minimum 95% of amalgam from the wastestream. In addition to the amalgam separator
requirement, the following best management practices (BMPs) that directly affect sewer
discharges were required by the ordinance:
     • Do not rinse chairside traps, vacuum screens, or amalgam separator equipment in a sink or
       other sanitary sewer connection.
     • Train staff in the proper handling and disposal of amalgam materials and fixer-containing
       solutions; training records are available for inspection.
     • Do not use bleach or other chlorine-containing disinfectants to disinfect the vacuum line
       system.
     • Do not use bulk liquid mercury; use only precapsulated dental amalgam.
     • Store amalgam waste in accordance with recycler or hauler instructions.
  Other amalgam-related BMPs, though not required by the ordinance, are encouraged.

1. Dental Program Implementation
Based upon the information collected by the RWQCP in 2004, it was determined that 134 dental
offices in the RWQCP’s service area were required to install amalgam separators. A small
