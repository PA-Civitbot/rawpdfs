Mr. Roberts said an entire page of information explaining the Equivalent
Residential Unit (ERU) would appear on the ballot.

Council Member Kleinberg asked whether the acronym ERU was required by
law to be included.

Mr. Roberts said it was the term used in the ordinance.

Council Member Kleinberg asked whether a restriction existed, which
prohibited an explanation on the ballot that commercial and residential
properties were included.

Mayor Beecham said the question was whether the wording could be more
user-friendly.

Mr. Roberts said the ballot language would explain how it applied to
commercial property, how it worked, and would include a list of specific
projects.

Council Member Kleinberg asked the City Attorney whether the sentence the
public would read on their ballot could include that the $10 per ERU applied
to commercial and residential properties.

City Attorney Gary Baum said it could.

Council Member Kleinberg said she would like to see the clarification.

Council Member Mossar said the motion should be passed first.

Council Member Kleinberg agreed.

Mayor Beecham said this was the only opportunity the community had to
repair the storm drains.

MOTION PASSED 8-1, Cordell no.

MOTION: Council Member Kleinberg moved, seconded by Mossar, to direct
staff to amend the ballot language to make it clear the fee applies to both
residential and commercial/industrial properties.

Council Member Kishimoto wanted to add the word “decrease” after the
word “increase” in the ballot wording.

Council Member Kleinberg said she would not accept it as a friendly
amendment.
