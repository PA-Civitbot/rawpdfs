Council Member Scharff preferred the Council's first meeting after vacation
be August 17, and the vacation begin on July 6. June 29 was not a regular
meeting, but could be used if needed.

Mayor Holman indicated that was six weeks.

MOTION: Council Member Scharff moved, seconded by Council Member
Kniss to adopt a Resolution to schedule the City Councilâ€™s summer break
from July 6, 2015 to August 14, 2015.

Mayor Holman advised that with no meeting on June 29, the Council would
miss seven Monday meetings.

Mr. Keene clarified that the Council could meet on June 29.

Council Member Berman asked if the Council's policy changed to meeting
four Mondays a month.

Mayor Holman reported meetings were scheduled for the fourth Monday in
order to conduct the large amount of business.

Mr. Keene indicated the practice had become four meetings a month.

Council Member Berman clarified that the Council did not have to meet four
Mondays each month.

Vice Mayor Schmid felt the July vacation in 2014 worked well. The only
disadvantage was Council Appointed Officers' reviews tended to be delayed.

Council Member DuBois inquired about the likelihood of meeting on June 29.

Mr. Keene advised that the likelihood was great, but the Council had control
of its meeting dates. There were five Mondays in June, so theoretically the
Council could meet on five Mondays in June. Once the Council set its
schedule, Staff would schedule items as best as possible to fit the Council's
schedule. The meeting on June 29 could be reserved for carry over items.

Council Member DuBois inquired whether July 6 was an official City holiday
as July 4 fell on Saturday.

Mr. Keene reported most employees would receive a floater holiday for July
4 since it fell on the weekend.

Ms. Minor clarified that July 3 was the official City holiday and employees'
9/80 Friday.
