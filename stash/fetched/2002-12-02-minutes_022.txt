serious and committed numbers that represented a minimum number of
units on the sites, the Council needed to make it clear that the numbers
were included to give an example of the ranges that might be appropriate on
the sites, subject to later analysis. She referred to the February 4, 2002,
version of the plan.

Council Member Burch added up the high numbers from all the earlier
documents, and the total came out to 1,246.

Mayor Ojakian clarified the Council’s hands were not tied when it came to a
project that was brought to the Council that had more units.

Ms. Furth said that was correct. There were other policies in the Comp Plan
that would push the Council in a certain direction on some of the sites.

Mayor Ojakian said he would not support the substitute motion.

Vice Mayor Mossar said adding up the numbers did not take the housing
yield past the tolerable limits for CEQA.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION FAILED 3-3, Burch, Kleinberg, Mossar “yes,”
Beecham, Freeman, Morton “not participating.”

Council Member Burch suggested a friendly amendment to add the sentence
suggested by the City Manager.

Ms. Furth said the wording was, “New State Legislation, AB 2292 requires
compensating changes in the inventory if fewer units are permitted on a
site. A larger number of units may be approved on any site when consistent
with the Comprehensive Plan, Zoning and State Law.” Staff could add
stronger language.

Mayor Ojakian said Mr. Benest suggested adding language that said “these
are only minimum.”

Mr. Benest said, “Any individual site may be approved for a larger number of
units.”

Ms. Furth suggested, “The numbers were only minimums, and a
substantially larger number may be approved on a particular site.”
Mayor Ojakian said the number might be different based on individual
project review.

Mr. Benest suggested, “An individual site may be approved for more units.”
