to Staff. Staff was scheduled to return to Council in October 2011 with
completed recommendations.

City Manager, James Keene reiterated Staff was before Council as directed in
the previous meeting to review the process after considering the comments
received by the public.

Council Member Schmid asked whether the analysis of the proposal before
Council was driven by the general City goals. He asked if the sustainability
goals had a reduction in greenhouse gases, zero waste goals, and renewable
energy goals.

Mr. Bobel stated that was correct, those were the three principle goals within
the proposal.

Council Member Schmid asked for confirmation that this was a long-term
project and that there may be a review beyond the 20-year lifespan of the
project.

Mr. Bobel stated that was correct, the term of 20-years was chosen as it was
a standard engineering lifespan for most of the equipment being used in the
project.

Council Member Schmid asked whether it was a fair statement that Council
should be aware this matter was a long-term commitment beyond that of
the present Council.

Mr. Bobel stated yes, that was correct.

Council Member Schmid stated when this was brought to Council in April of
2010 and the direction was for there to be new conversion technology
reviewed with neighboring cityâ€™s that had similar goals.

Mr. Bobel stated yes, that was the understanding.

Council Member Schmid stated over the past twelve months there had been
active exploration of new conversion technology by regional groupings in
California. He asked whether Staff was aware of the activity in Los Angeles
County.

Mr. Bobel stated he had some knowledge of the activity.

Council Member Schmid asked whether Staff was aware of the activity in
Santa Barbara County.

Mr. Bobel stated yes he was aware of the activity.
