                      DRAFT MINUTES
Council Member Burt thought everything there was for that
purpose.

Council Member Price said that was correct, but that they had not
mentioned the future at all, which was part of her next set of
comments.

Council Member Burt said that it would not be buried in just the
transportation Guiding Principle.

Council Member Price dropped her changes.

Mayor Yeh said that the only change to Guiding Principle
Number15 was “access to and within Cubberley.” Regarding a
potential Guiding Principle Number 16 he had “Funding options
including existing and potential new funding sources should be
evaluated.” He said that was a broad direction to the CAC. It
was not listed because it was a potential new Guiding Principle
Number 16.

Council Member Burt said that his original statement was
consistent with what Council Member Klein had stated. He was
referring to the funds that were currently going to PAUSD and
that when those were no longer due for purposes of the lease and
covenant not to develop, that those funds would be used to
provide community services and recreational facilities similar to
those currently provided at Cubberley.

Mayor Yeh said “funds that are currently going to PAUSD were no
longer going for purposes of the lease or covenant not to develop,
shall be.”

Council Member Burt suggested finishing the verbiage with “used
primarily to provide community services and recreational facilities
similar to those currently provided at Cubberley.” He said that
was not intended to be final wording but only a statement of
principle.
