Consent Calendar

Mayor Burt: Our next item is the Consent Calendar. Entertain a Motion to
approve.

Female: (inaudible)

Mayor Burt: I was going to allow public speaker after the Motion to approve.

Council Member Kniss: So moved.

Council Member Holman: Second. Looking to the maker of the Motion,
that's incorporating the recommendations and suggestions by Mr. Borock
and confirmed by City Manager?

Council Member Kniss: Yes.

Council Member Holman: That's Item Number 13.

Mayor Burt: Can I ask a clarification? Is it incorporating specifically what
Mr. Borock said or what the City Manager said he intended to do, not
necessarily identical?

Council Member Holman: I understand. Correct me if I'm wrong. I
understood the City Manager to concur with Mr. Borock's comments
regarding Section 106 process. I thought there was some reference to his
suggestion about commenting dates also, which were in the latter part of
Mr. Borock's letter.

Mayor Burt: I'm just wanting to clarify whether you are explicitly saying
Mr. Borock's language as opposed to the thrust and at the City Manager's
discretion.

James Keene, City Manager: I'd really prefer, I think, the Staff's comments
were to be responsive and respectfully responsive to Mr. Borock's
comments. I'd feel better if theâ€”I can't find them right now. The way that I
expressed it would be the language that he would be asking us for.

Council Member Holman: Say that again please.

Mr. Keene: The way that I had worded during the Manager's Comment
would be the direction, the change that's correct.

Council Member Holman:     If you could find that to repeat it, it would be
most helpful. Apologies.
