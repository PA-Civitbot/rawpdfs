Motion, “increase the penalty for violations of Municipal Code Section
18.52.050 to $1,000 and $4,000 beginning the 181st day following notice of
violation.” (New Part D)

Council Member Wolbach: What about "C"? Did that get approval?

Mayor Burt: What about what?

Council Member Wolbach: Did "C" get approval of the maker and seconder?

Council Member Kniss: Yes.

Mayor Burt: Yes, it did. The maker and the seconder, did you?

Vice Mayor Scharff: We didn't give approval, but I'm fine to give approval.

Council Member Kniss: We both nodded.

Vice Mayor Scharff: You did; I didn't.

Mayor Burt: Noddings don't count. Maker and seconder have also approved
"C." Thank you. Council Member Filseth.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to add to the Motion, “increase the penalty for
violations of Municipal Code Sections 16.49.050, 16.49.060, 16.49.070,
16.49.080, and 16.49.090 to $10,000.” (New Part C)

Council Member Filseth: Thanks. I just want to make sure I understand on
the Edgewood thing. If we pass this, then the penalty basically immediately
goes to $5,000 as opposed to it goes to $2,500 now and then$ 5,000 after
181 days. Is that right?

Ms. Gitelman: If you pass this, then day one we could charge $1,000,
increasing to $2,000 after three days. After six months, we could charge
$4,000 a day, increasing to $8,000 a day after three days.

Council Member Filseth: For Amendment A?

Unknown: That's this one.
