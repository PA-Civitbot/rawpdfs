      Create a Special News Rack Area in the California Avenue Commercial

Council Member Morton stated he would not participate in the item due to a
conflict of interest because he owns a small interest in a building within 500
feet of California Avenue.

City Attorney Gary Baum stated he would research further as to whether it
was a definite conflict.

Ronna Devincenzi, 2600 El Camino Real #100, spoke against amending the
Ordinance. She requested further research be done on the newspaper racks
that encroach on useable sidewalk space.

Interim Deputy City Manager Steve Emslie recommended the Council
continue the item and make modifications to the Ordinance.

MOTION: Mayor Klein moved, seconded by Council Member Espinosa, to
continue Agenda Item No. 10 to a date uncertain.

Council Member Schmid noted reading in the report how involved the
Planning Department was in the beautification of California Avenue corridor.

Council Member Yeh asked if there would be a joint meeting with the
Planning and Transportation Commission regarding updates and discussions
on the California Avenue project.

Mr. Emslie stated yes, there was a joint meeting planned for July 28, 2008.
