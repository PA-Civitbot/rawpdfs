                               MINUTES

Council Member Klein confirmed that was a fifth of a mile.

Mr. Rodriguez said that was correct.

Council Member Klein asked what the average vehicle speed was on
California Avenue.

Mr. Rodriguez said 20-25 miles per hour.

Council Member Klein asked long it took to get from El Camino Real to Park
Boulevard.

Mr. Rodriguez said the travel time was less than 2 minutes.

Council Member Klein said that if the speed went from 25 to 15 miles per
hour it would be approximately an extra minute of travel time from El
Camino Real to Park Boulevard.

Mr. Rodriquez agreed.

Council Member Klein confirmed that if California Avenue stayed at four
lanes the other improvements were not possible.

Mr. Rodriguez said that was correct.

Mr. Keene said all one had to do was look at the street sections.

Council Member Klein said he had received a hundred emails that said
people wanted the improvements and four lanes. He said that having read
the e-mails he was not persuaded that what people wanted was just a traffic
or time trial. He knew Staff had more meetings with the merchants and
asked if the merchants wanted a test of traffic congestion, or if there were
other questions they wanted tested.

Mr. Williams said they had also heard about impacts to loading and
unloading as part of it and people parking, but that went back to the delay
issue.

Council Member Klein asked how they would test for the loading and
unloading.

Mr. Williams said that they would stripe areas off as the loading and
unloading zones and work with the merchants on the delivery patterns.
