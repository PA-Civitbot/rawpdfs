Council Member Kleinberg asked if it was possible to get the traffic analysis

Mr. Emslie said the Ordinance provided a process by which parts could be

Council Member Kleinberg asked what the exemption process would be and

Mr. Emslie said the EIR must analyze the project and the alternatives to the
project as required by CEQA. The project description was mid-range and
