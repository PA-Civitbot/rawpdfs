are Steven Ennis and Drew Reitz, that's Rapunzel's prince and Cinderella's

Ms. Halpern: That's it for tonight. Did we redeem ourselves, Council
Member Kniss? Thank you so much for having us.

Mayor Burt: Thank you. Good luck to ...

Council Member Kniss: Could I ask, Pat?

Mayor Burt: Yes.

Council Member Kniss: I probably should know what it's from; I don't.

Mr. Klein: The song they just sung?

Council Member Kniss: Pardon?

Mr. Klein: Are you asking about the song they just sung?

Council Member Kniss: Yes.

Mr. Klein: It's from Into the Woods. It just was made into a movie recently.
It's by Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine. It came out in '87, 1987, and
it saw a Broadway revival in 2002. We're really excited to bring it. It's
basically a giant mash-up of all children's fairy tales, and then what happens
when happily ever after ends.

Council Member Kniss: A little dark.

Mr. Klein: Depends on what you're watching. The first act is very much a
fairy tale, and the second act becomes a little dark. It's a very funny show.

Council Member Kniss: Thanks very much.

Mr. Klein: Thank you.

Ms. Halpern: I just wanted to close that each one of you has received this
about the players.

Mayor Burt: Council Member DuBois.

Council Member DuBois: I just wanted to thank you guys. That was
awesome. My daughter loves Into the Woods, and I like it too. I was
looking ahead. I'm looking forward to Spamalot myself. It looks like a good
season.
