Council Member Klein stated the Core Values were clear although had not
been documented; balanced finances, environmental sustainability, social
equity, and care for the youth. Without being exclusive he did not feel there
were any controversial items. He believed the Motion provided adequate
ability to continue any discussion to the April meeting that may not be
completed on February 2, 2013.

Council Member Kniss mentioned the Agenda documented Item Number four
as potential Core Values. She asked if there were possible additions to them.

Council Member Klein stated the term potential referred to potentially
adopted.

Council Member Kniss asked if there were more Core Values being added.

Council Member     Klein   noted   currently   there   were   no   Core     Values
documented.

Council Member Kniss urged the Council to document the Core Values prior
to discussing the action plans.

Council Member Burt noted there would not be an action plan at the end of
Saturdayâ€™s retreat but there would be perspective actions. The actions were
tied to the priorities not the Core Values. He agreed that he would have
preferred the Core Values to precede the priorities. The focus of the
Saturday Retreat was surrounding priority setting with brief discussions
around actions and Core Values. The second session was to refine the
implementation of the priorities and provide the opportunity to have a
meaningful and thoughtful discussion on Core Values.
