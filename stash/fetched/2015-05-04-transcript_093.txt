Mr. Popp: If you don't mind, one more quick question. Maybe I missed it in
not being able to see the whole thing. I want to understand the process that
you're sending this back for. This will go back to some discussion at HRB.
That will inform the discussion at the Architectural Review Board. Then it
will go back to the Director. At that point, could it potentially be done or
does it necessarily come back to Council?

Mayor Holman: Depends on if it's appealed again or not.

Council Member Burt:      The way we had the Motion is that we were
continuing the appeal.

Mayor Holman: True, thank you.

Council Member Kniss: It is what it is.

Council Member Burt: In that sense, it would return to Council.

Mr. Popp: It would return back to Council with the information coming from
HRB and ARB.

Council Member Burt: The hope would be that the changes would allow us
to deny the appeal.

Mr. Popp : I'm just being asked would it come on Consent or would it come
back for discussion? That would be up to you?

Council Member Burt: Yeah.

Mayor Holman: Council Members, while we're waiting for printouts, do you
want to take a five-minute break?

Council took a break from 11:09 P.M. to 11:13 P.M.

Mayor Holman: We've been at this a long time. Council Members, I suggest
that we take just a minute and read through the Motion, so we're all clear on
what's before us. Chair Popp has a comment.

Council Member Kniss: Mayor Holman, is there any timeline in this? Is this
open-ended?

Mayor Holman: It does not currently have a timeline in it. Give us just a
moment so we can read through this first. Chair Popp, did you have some
comments you wanted to make?
