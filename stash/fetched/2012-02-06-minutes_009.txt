Public Works, Solid Waste Manager, Brad Eggleston stated that was correct.
He said that as of the current fiscal year there was no new rent being
assessed.   The rent currently paid was deferred under the smoothing
schedule adopted by Council in the past.

Vice Mayor Scharff said the Staff response indicated long term composting
on the site would cost $58,000 per month. He said that part of that would
be rent and part of that would be $17,000 for additional costs. The total
was roughly $128,000. He asked if those costs would be incurred if
composting was extended three to four months.

Mr. Bobel said they did not think so. He said that whether rent was charged
was a policy issue. Council could decide to charge rent for those three or
four months that goes beyond the values already being paid. Staff did not
assume that in its short-term analysis.

Vice Mayor Scharff said the current assumption was that there would not be
any additional costs other than the $45,000.

Mr. Bobel said that for the next few months Staff’s assumption was that
there would not be new rent.

Vice Mayor Scharff asked if the composting operations would require an
additional two months.

Mr. Bobel said that was approximate, but that it was possible only one
month would be necessary.

Vice Mayor Scharff asked if Staff could return after three months to request
direction on the composting.

Mr. Bobel said yes.

Vice Mayor Scharff asked if the regulatory agencies would allow composting.

Mr. Bobel said that the regulatory agencies would be very concerned about a
long term continuation of composting. They were not concerned about
continued composting over the next two to four months.

Vice Mayor Scharff asked if composting could continue after four months.
