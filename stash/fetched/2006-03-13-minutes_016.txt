COUNCIL COMMENTS, ANNOUNCEMENTS, AND REPORTS FROM CONFERENCES

City Attorney Gary Baum noted the agenda had been revised to reflect the
legal requirements of AB1234 to report City funds spent outside the Palo
Alto area while attending conferences.

Council Member Beecham referred to Item No. 5 regarding protocols for
spending monies needing approval of the Mayor requesting clarification of
approval by e-mail with copy to City Clerk.

MOTION: Council Member Beecham moved, seconded by Kleinberg, to
amend protocols to bring Item 5 back for reconsideration.

MOTION PASSED 8-0, Mossar absent.

MOTION: Council Member Beecham moved, seconded by Barton, to clarify
that the protocols are changed so the Mayor can give approval for
reimbursement of expenses with a copy to the City Clerk.

MOTION PASSED 8-0, Mossar absent.

Vice Mayor Kishimoto said certain eligible activities were not being approved
by staff due to past precedence and changes to the policy should be
considered.

Mayor Kleinberg said Council Members received a small compensation and
the public was unaware of the number of events Council Members were
asked to attend and not compensated for. She suggested eligible costs be
referred to the Policy and Services Committee.

Council Member Beecham asked whether expense reports needed to be
written or verbal.

Mr. Baum said State law implied oral reports. He said verbal was the first
choice and written was second if Council Member was absent or unable to
provide the report at the next meeting.

Council Member Beecham clarified State law was precise that reports be
given at the next meeting.
