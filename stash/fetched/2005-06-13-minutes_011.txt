Ms. Johnson said gas-powered leaf blowers would be banned for commercial
gardeners as well as for residents.

Council Member Beecham asked whether an initiative or other action could
be taken if the Council did not take action.

Mr. Baum said if no action were taken, the ordinance would go into effect on
July 1, 2005; gas-powered leaf blower’s use would be banned in residential
areas by homeowners, gardeners, and City staff. An initiative could allow or
ban all forms of leaf blowers.

Council Member Beecham stated the objective was to reach a certain lower
noise level on leaf blowers and asked whether it had been effectively
mapped.

Ms. Johnson said an instrument’s rating could be affected by other factors.

Council Member Beecham said electric blowers might not be quieter.

Ms. Johnson agreed. She said in other cities, gardeners chose to use gas-
powered generators to operate their electric leaf blowers.

Council Member Beecham asked when other cities banned leaf blowers, were
all blowers banned or just gas-powered leaf blowers.

Ms. Johnson said the greater majority of the bans were on gas powered leaf
blowers.

Council Member Beecham said the expectation was other cities had electric
gas generator powered, or battery operated, leaf blowers.         He asked
whether the battery-operated leaf blowers were quieter than gas blowers.

Ms. Johnson said most of the battery-operated leaf blowers were quieter.

Vice Mayor Kleinberg said a 1998 report listed the cities that had banned gas
and/or electric leaf blowers; most of the cities listed had banned gas leaf
blowers.

Council Member Beecham said in 2002 an amendment to the approved
ordinance extended the ban’s deadline until 2005 with the hope the noise
generation and gas emissions of the gas leaf blowers would be reduced. He
asked whether any recent leaf blowers met the 65-dBA testing.
