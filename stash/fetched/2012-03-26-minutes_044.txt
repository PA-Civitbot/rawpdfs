Mr. Perez indicated IBRC recommended it be $4.2 million over a ten-year
period to address catch-up.

Mr. Keene asked whether wide open could include the Policy & Services
considering a term on a particular issue.

Vice Mayor Scharff answered yes.

Council Member Burt asked if doubling the street paving              budget
accomplished catch-up on streets over a prolonged period of time.

Mr. Sartor stated the $3.7 million per year accomplished the IBRC
recommendation of having an average Pavement Condition Index (PCI)
score of 85 and nothing lower than 60 over ten years. He said that would be
a keep-up process. He indicated that amount moved the City to that goal, so
the City did not need to spend more than the $3.7 million. He said it would
catch-up the streets that were below those levels.

Council Member Burt inquired if the increase in funding for streets almost
two years ago moved the City into catch-up funding for streets.

Mr. Sartor replied yes.

Council Member Burt asked if this other $41 million under discussion was
catch-up aside from streets.

Mr. Sartor answered that was correct.

Mr. Keene noted it anticipated the potential of emergency issues.

Mr. Sartor said it catches up deferred maintenance of other Infrastructure
such as City buildings, City parks, sidewalks and those kinds of
Infrastructure.

Council Member Burt thought it was important to communicate this clearly.
He inquired if the City was already budgeted for keep-up from existing
revenue streams, and was budgeted for catch-up on streets out of existing
revenue streams.

Mr. Sartor reported it was not correct for keep-up for Infrastructure other
than streets. He indicated the IBRC recommended an additional $2.2 million
annually for keeping up maintenance of all.
