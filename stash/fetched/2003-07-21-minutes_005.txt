VOTING FOR PAUL VADOPALAS:

Council Member Kishimoto read a statement on behalf of Council Member
Freeman, which said, "While choosing the next Utilities Advisory
Commissioner, I hope you all take balance into consideration. It appears the
current UAC mix is substantially weighed toward brilliant business minds.
Balancing the attributes with those having outstanding technical acumen
would offer another valuable dimension for Council decision-making.
Elizabeth Dahlen, Jeff Hoel, Jerry Scharf, and Walter Loewenstein all seem to
offer technical expertise. From scouring the UAC minutes, I would like to
express my appreciation for Dexter Dawes' thoughtful and regular questions,
and Dick Rosenbaum's multiple-year knowledge base and fiscal
responsibility. Good luck in appointing from this field of superior candidates".
