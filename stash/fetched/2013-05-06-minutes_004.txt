Stephanie Munoz previously requested the Council not reduce employee
health benefits. Now, Staff proposed a 2 percent pay raise to increase
compensation. Rather than giving employees a raise, the Council should
reinstate health insurance benefits. She felt a new position could have been
filled internally at a lower compensation rate if employees had been invited
to apply. The idea of increasing compensation because other cities paid
more than Palo Alto was not reasonable.

Andrew Boone worked as a volunteer to improve conditions for bicycling and
walking. U.S. Census data indicated 10 percent of Palo Alto residents used
bicycles as the primary mode of transportation to work. A large percentage
of children used bicycles to travel to school. He was pleased the City
continued to make improvements.
