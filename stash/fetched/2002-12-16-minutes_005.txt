SPECIAL MEETING

1.   Study Session - Single Family Individual Review Program: One-Year
     Status Report

     Staff presented an overview of the program that became effective
     November 19, 2001, noting that 104 applications had been submitted
     with distribution throughout the City, that application rates increased
     despite the economic downturn, that the guidelines had been well
     received by applicants and designers, that the Zoning Ordinance
     Update would include text changes to the ordinance, and that the
     application fees for second floor expansions did not cover
     administration costs for those applications. Future of Single Family
     Neighborhoods Advisory Group members Carol Harrington, Annette
     Glancoff Ashton and John Northway spoke to the program, noting that
     education of neighbors about what to expect was key to minimizing
     controversy and forwarding Craig Woods’ comments to the Council.
     During Public Comments, Roger Kohler noted his issues with the
     guidelines and lack of staff. The Council noted their appreciation for
     staff’s efforts, concern about program staffing, support for the
     necessary escalation of application fees, and suggestions for customer
     feedback and use of the City’s website for outreach.

No action required.

ADJOURNMENT: The meeting adjourned at 7:25 p.m.
