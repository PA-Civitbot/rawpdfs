ACTION ITEMS

8.   Selection of Option for Connectivity Between the Art Center and the
     Main Library (CIPs PE-11000, PF-07000).

Public Works Director, Mike Sartor reported the purpose of Staff's
recommendation was to bring the Main Library and Art Center campus into a
cohesive area by restructuring the space between the two facilities and
making some proposed improvements in landscaping and plaza area
between the two buildings.       Staff recommended that a connector or
driveway be constructed between the parking lots of the two facilities, but
would present options to that plan for pedestrians and bicycles.
