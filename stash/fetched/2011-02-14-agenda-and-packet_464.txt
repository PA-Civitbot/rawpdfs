                                                                                                              Attachment: PA Comments EPA HQ-OAR-2009-0559_Final (1297 : EPA Proposed Rule on Sewage Sludge Incinerators)
       The following is the NEORSD’s preliminary estimate of costs to procure and install
   additional air pollution control devices that would be required to achieve compliance with
   the proposed SSI rule.

1. Reduction in Particulate Matter and Metal Emissions

A. Advanced Scrubbing Systems

      In order to reduce particulate matter and some of the particulate based cadmium, lead,
and mercury, an advanced scrubbing system might be required.

        Recent bids for the NEORSD’s Southerly WWTP’s new fluidized bed incineration
project, the procurement cost of each of the new “Venturi Pak” advanced scrubbing system was
$0.75 million. Assuming $0.5 - 1.0 million for delivery and installation costs, related
instrumentation, controls and electrical modifications, and engineering related services, the total
cost of a single unit installed would be in the range of $1.25 - $1.75 million/unit (2009 $). This
does not include the cost of additional space in a new facility and nor the cost to renovate or
expand an existing facility.

B. Wet Electrostatic Precipitators (ESPs)

      If wet electrostatic precipitators (ESPs) are required to reduce particulate matter and
some of the particulate based metal emissions, costs would be substantially higher than the
aforementioned costs for advanced scrubbing systems.

       In 2001, bids for a new biosolids handling complex at the Metropolitan WWTP in St.
Paul, Minnesota which included the installation of three wet ESPs. The bid price for the three
units was $2.49 million or $831,000 per unit. The associated design work and the necessary
ductwork, piping, structural, instrumentation and controls, electrical, etc., could total $2.6
million ($867,000 per unit). As a result, total costs averaged $1.7 million per wet ESP (2001$).

       Given substantial increases in corrosion resistant metal costs since 2001, along with a
44% increase in the Engineering News Record’s construction cost index, costs would be $2.5 -
$3 million million per wet ESP (2009 $). This does not include the cost of additional space in
the new facility nor the cost to renovate or expand an existing facility.

       For the NEORSD’s Southerly WWTP new fluidized bed incineration project,
approximately 15 feet would have to be added onto the new facility to house the wet ESPs and
associated equipment and we do not have room at Westerly or Easterly to add this equipment.
