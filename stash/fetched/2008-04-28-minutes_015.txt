reusable bags; and 2) return to Council as soon as practical after June 30,
2008 with recommendations for a comprehensive program and ordinance
incorporating those recommendations.

Council Member Burt asked whether the plastic bags containing newsprint
had been considered as part of this reduction process.

Mr. Bobel stated the issue of all plastic bags was being considered, but at
this point the beginning of the process was store bags.

Council Member Burt asked if it could be mandated to reduce the newsprint
bags to one per paper from two.

Mr. Bobel stated he would review this concept.

Mayor Klein asked whether the timeline of three months was too short.

Mr. Bobel stated the goal was to complete the process in the timeframe
stated in the report, with the Council break in August the return date would
be September.

Council Member Morton stated the expectancy of a lawsuit was inevitable;
the plastic bag corporations were not likely to give in.

Council Member Kishimoto supported the idea of charging for the use of the
bags.

MOTION PASSED: 9-0
