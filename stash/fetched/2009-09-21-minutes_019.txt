designation. He stated this may lead to a perceived inconsistency in regards
to the extension regulations.

Council Member Burt stated fairness was significant, and the P&TC
recommendations provided reasonable protection for the City and
Developers.

AMENDMENT: Council Member Burt moved, seconded by Council Member
Barton to accept P&TC recommendation revised to include Staff
recommendation of an automatic one-year extension for Site and Design and
Planned Community projects and subsequent extensions would require P&TC
review and Council approval.

Council Member Barton stated the Amendment was               a   reasonable
compromise that added a level of fairness to the Motion.

Council Member Kishimoto spoke on the issue of fairness and her frustration
with the Comprehensive Plan’s timeline.

Vice Mayor Morton stated his support to change the Motion to extend the life
of valid permits approved to December 31, 2010, instead of June 30, 2010.

Council Member Burt stated he would not support Vice Mayor Morton’s
proposal. He requested clarification on the difference between the Motion,
Substitute Motion, and Amendment.

Mr. Williams stated the only differing issue was the recommendation of the
Site and Design and Planned Community Zoning. These permits would
expire in one or two years and the Amendment would provide for a one-year
automatic extension, and beyond that, would require the project to return to
P&TC and the City Council for further extensions.

Vice Mayor Morton inquired whether the Amendment would call for a re-
hearing.

Mr. Williams stated yes.

Council Member Espinosa iterated the importance of balance and fairness
that was contained within the Amendment and Substitute Motion.
