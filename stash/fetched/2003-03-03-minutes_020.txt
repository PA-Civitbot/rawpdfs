Council Member Ojakian asked who could be housed at the Opportunity
Center.

Mr. Emslie replied the project was for the lowest income level up to 35
percent of the County median. The funding for the programs available at
the State and Federal level depended on having a specific project in order to
qualify. The City needed to take that initial step to have a viable project
that competed for the subsidies. CWG had stated they were committed to
securing the funding that would apply to the most indigent in the
community.
