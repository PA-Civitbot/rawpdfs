                         TRANSCRIPT
Council Member Holman: One thing we didn't—if there are intersection
improvements, that the cost implications be brought forward including the
fair share of the applicant.

Mayor Burt: Okay.

INCPORORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to add to the Motion, “include cost implications
including fair share costs to Applicant of intersection improvements.” (New
Part G)

Council Member Holman: Thank you to the applicant for bearing with us.
I'm sorry this is a long, windy road hear.

Mayor Burt: Council Member Wolbach.

Council Member Wolbach: I would just ask that the words "and lighting" be
added after "bird-safe design." It might be redundant, but I just want to be
very explicit. It'd just say "bird-safe design and lighting."

Mayor Burt: That's acceptable to me.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to add to the Motion Part C, “and lighting.”

Mayor Burt: Council Member Kniss.

Council Member Kniss: Because I did end up voting no, I think it's worth an
explanation to the applicant, which is important. I am very persuaded by
the height. I think, Pat, you did a good convincing job of height being not
very compatible with the buildings that are close by. I think it's got to be
difficult for the applicant to relook at this again. I think long term it will
make a big difference.

Mayor Burt: Thank you. That completes that item.

Male: (inaudible)

MOTION RESTATED: Mayor Burt moved, seconded by Council Member
Holman to refer this project to the Architectural Review Board (ARB) with
guidance to:

A.   More carefully calculate the permissible Floor Area Ratio (FAR); and

B.   Adjust the building’s height and mass to be more consistent with
     Compatibility Findings; and
                                                                         Page 126 of 128
