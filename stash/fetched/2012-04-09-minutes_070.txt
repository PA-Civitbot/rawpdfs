poll.

Mayor Yeh said he heard Council Member Espinosa say that a
task should be developed around funding, but not that there
should be a Guiding Principle. He said he wanted to get through
the Guiding Principles and then if there were proposed tasks, for

Mr. Keene added that the idea of the CPAC all along was to serve
