however; if they do not agree then the City would need to purchase the land
to create the pathway.

Mayor Klein stated it was not Council protocol to negotiate in public.

Mr. Baum stated it would require the opening of public discussion.

Mayor Klein stated we would separate the Motion for the purpose of voting.
He stated he would not support the Motion.

Vice Mayor Drekmeier asked for clarification on the Motion questioning if the
Applicant worked with the City to follow the Dinah route from Wilkie Way to
El Camino Real, would that meet the requirement of the Motion.

Council Member Morton stated yes.

Vice Mayor Drekmeier asked whether the Applicant was in a position where
the approval was conditional could the Motion include a shorter connection
from the potential right-of-way from behind the houses to the park.

Council Member Morton stated yes, he merely wanted a full connection.

Council Member Yeh asked whether everything could be approved at one
time or did this portion need to be approved tonight.

Mr. Emslie asked Council to give staff and the Applicant time to review their
options and report back. That would require a Motion to continue.

Council Member Yeh stated without the approval of the map tonight the
project could still move forward and return with the second map.

MOTION AMENDED: Council Member Morton moved, seconded by Council
Member Kishimoto, to continue to a date uncertain, the Approval of a

Located at 4249 and 4251 El Camino Real, with staff to return with clear
answers to pedestrian/bicycle access from Wilkie Way.
