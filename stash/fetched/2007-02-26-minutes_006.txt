Council Member Barton requested the current agency list and the funding
amounts be brought to the next meeting.

Mr. Benest agreed to furnish a listing of the current agencies and their
funding.

Council Member Barton inquired about the elimination of the Police Records
Specialist position with a resultant $71,000 savings.

Mr. Benest stated the budget showed the additions and deletions of costs.
The net effect in the Police Department was one less full time employee
(FTE).

Council Member Barton commented on how difficult the budget cuts had
been on all parties involved and asked how the proposal would have differed
if the request was to perform a $3 million cut in three phases.

Council Member Morton stated the infrastructure required a funding
increase. Depleting the community funds was going to affect the City
negatively.

Council Member Drekmeier stated staffing Fire Station 8 on all high-fire days
during the summer season with a full company would save the City
$140,000. He asked about current staffing.

Mr. Benest stated, previously, there had been three firefighters on twelve
hour shifts for the full summer. The program cost $140,000 plus with a
portion paid by Los Altos Hills.

Council Member Drekmeier clarified the cuts suggested were for a number of
days not staff.

Mr. Benest stated the reduction of fire services seemed feasible, although
the current three-year contract with the Union would create opposition.

Council Member Drekmeier asked how the increase in hazmat inspections
saved $50,000.

Mr. Benest stated the hazmat inspections were a self-supporting activity.
With the existing staff and an increase in productivity, the revenue would be
increased.

Council Member Drekmeier asked about the impact on the community with
one less fire unit available.
