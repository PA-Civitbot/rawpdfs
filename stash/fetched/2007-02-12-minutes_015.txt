Ms. Harrison said if no additional revisions were to be made to the Council’s
role, staff would be finalizing the plan. Partnership roles needed to be
defined, as well as the City role in the areas of training, liaisons, and
interacting, and the use of City’s budget resources. The Council would need
to direct staff to continue working with the community to maximize the
resources and continue to update the Council in bringing the plan together.

Council Member Kleinberg referred to media notification and the Brown Act’s
requirement of 24-hour noticing on special meetings and wanted to know
who would determine whether a meeting was an emergency. She asked if a
detailed handbook would be provided.

Ms. Harrison said the Emergency Operations Plan Outline was the only
informational document that would be provided.

Council Member Kleinberg asked what assistance would be given to the
Mayor in reaching the appropriate contacts.

Ms. Harrison said the City Manager would act as the emergency coordinator
for the entire City organization with support from department heads in
dealing with legal requirements and noticing.

Mr. Benest said he had the legal authority to call the emergency meeting.

Council Member Kleinberg asked what type of support would be given to the
Council.

Ms. Harrison said it would be a back and forth communication between City
staff and the Council in providing information to each other.

Council Member Kleinberg did not feel the operational plan provided
sufficient hands-on instructions to the Council in terms of assisting staff and
assuring the public that everything would run smoothly.

Ms. Harrison said she agreed with having a checklist as well as incorporating
a dry run of a training exercise.

Mayor Kishimoto asked what Police and Fire officers’ priorities were in
serving the City versus helping their families.
