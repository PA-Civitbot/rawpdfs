Mayor Mossar asked staff to confirm Council Member Burch’s concern
regarding the word.

Mr. Kott said people thought in terms of travel time more than spot
delays and, therefore, Measure 2 would be a more difficult measure to
attain than travel time.

Mr. Emslie said every intersection should be measured.

Council Member Burch said the word “any” was still a concern.

Mayor Mossar asked if Council Member Burch wanted to make an
amendment.

Council Member Burch asked the City Attorney for a suggestion.

Ms. Furth said the matrix stated the particular criterion needed to be
looked at in the context of the overall system.

AMENDMENT: Council Member Burch moved, seconded by Kleinberg,
to change Performance Measure 2 to state, “No increase in average
motor vehicle delay time during peak hours at any Charleston Road or
Arastradero Road Corridor Plan interchange unless appropriate for
overall system.”

Council Member Kleinberg said she had seconded the amendment for
discussion.

Council Member Freeman said there were locations where traffic lights
could force motorists into taking short cuts.

Council Member Lytle said the amendment was not necessary given
the context of the performance measures.

Council Member Kleinberg asked about the wording “no increase in
average delay.”

Mr. Kott said he should have said “peak hour average delay” and the
critical delay would be measured at the peak hour also. It was an
average of all of the vehicle movements for each intersection.

AMENDMENT WITHDRAWN BY MAKER

Mr. Kott answered it should be clarified.
