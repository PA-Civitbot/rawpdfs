Ms. Kendall said it was 2.0, which corresponded to the commission's
standards.

Council Member Lytle asked whether the High Street project was 2.3.

Ms. Kendall said it was higher than that initially. The proposal was adapted
to reduce it.

Council Member Lytle asked whether there was a model to show what was
currently there. Why was it assumed those historic buildings would be
preserved when the other one was not.

Ms. Kendall said staff made certain         assumptions while using the
development scenario that had been          worked through in order to
approximate a project of that scale.

Council Member Lytle asked whether there was anything in the
recommendations that would protect buildings, as indicated in the model.
There was a set of goals and objectives, but nothing that required
maintaining historic buildings.

Mr. Emslie said that was correct. The findings had been enhanced, but there
was nothing to prevent it all together.

Council Member Ojakian asked whether there was development being
discussed at the east corner parking lot of Channing Avenue at High Street.

Ms. Kendall said there was an approved project at that location, which had
not yet been developed.

Council Member Ojakian requested the FAR for the project.

Chief Planning Official Lisa Grote said it was within the existing CD-S zoning
of 1.0, and was a mixed-used project.

Council Member Ojakian asked whether there was anything similar to the
proposed project in the SOFA 2 area.

Ms. Kendall said she did not believe there were any new developments. The
project on Channing Avenue at High Street was going through final approval
at the time the SOFA 2 model was put together.

Ms. Grote said other remodeling projects were occurring, but they did not
add any additional square footage.
