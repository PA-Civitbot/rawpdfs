for the community all available information on the options.      He supported
the original amendment.

AMENDMENT FAILED 3-5, Cordell, Kishimoto, Kleinberg yes, Freeman
absent.

AMENDMENT:          Council    Member     Kishimoto   moved    to    consider
recommendations by PARC to include in alternatives the reconfiguration of
golf course to accommodate recycling and transfer station, playing fields and
other public facilities, while retaining the 18-hole course. It would be an
alternative to be looked at in the evaluation process that the EIR had
become.

AMENDMENT FAILED FOR LACK OF A SECOND

AMENDMENT: Council Member Kishimoto moved to direct staff to develop
two feasible sites outside the Baylands as alternatives to evaluate.

Mayor Beecham clarified it was not for staff to develop, but that the
contractor include in the Scope of Work that the EIR include two sites
outside of the Baylands.

Council Member Kleinberg asked to clarify whether it was to examine all
varieties of acreages.

Council Member Kishimoto said to evaluate only six-acre areas.

Mayor Beecham said the clarification was for whatever acreage size that
could be found.

Council Member Morton said the RFP was clear that staff was being asked to
look at alternatives. He saw no benefit to limiting it to two, and if staff
wanted to come up with three or four alternatives, it seemed an unnecessary
complication to the RFP. He asked his colleagues to vote for the original
motion.

Council Member Cordell clarified Council Member Kishimotoâ€™s amendment
referenced specifically alternative sites.

Council Member Kishimoto said the process would not get done unless
Council made it very clear and placed great importance to evaluate two
other alternatives outside of the Baylands.

City Attorney Gary Baum said in order to achieve the goal he advised that
the EIR include reasonable alternative sites.
