                         TRANSCRIPT

don't think we should assume that this measure will be the full funding
source for the grade separations in the county. If we get something in the
vicinity of what we're looking for here, it's going to be a tremendous
foundation for grade separations that we've never had to date.

Mr. Keene: If I just might add. I think it's pretty clear to us. We already
have existing general policy direction from the Council that grade
separations are really our top priority, whether it relates to this measure or
not. I think that's always going to inform any kind of negotiation. If there
are things that are moving, I think we have a sense of certainly that is the
top priority.

AMENDMENT:        Council Member DuBois moved, seconded by Council
Member XX to add to the Motion, “direct City representative to work towards
increasing the percentage to at least 15 percent for Caltrain grade
separation and cap Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) to San Jose funding at 20
percent.”

AMENDMENT FAILED DUE TO THE LACK OF A SECOND

Mayor Burt: Let's vote on the board.       That passes unanimously.          That
concludes this item.
