midnight. However, I will touch on one other issue. Council was asked whether the

comp plan is too long and whether there were too many programs. Last year, when the

Council reviewed our S Cap (which is a fancy word for our climate action plan), the

Council removed the implementation plan from the policy document and put it in an

appendix. This is what the majority of Council suggested be done with the Comp Plan

programs on Monday night. No programs were discarded or cancelled. Instead the

direction was to bring the Comp Plan back to Council with the programs in a separate

Appendix. This is in effect a formatting change that many other communities use when

developing their comp plan. It allows the key goals and policies to remain in place for

the long term while giving more flexibility to future City Councils to adjust

implementation measures as circumstances dictate and as conditions change.




I realize this may sound like an in the weeds, wonky nuanced explanation, but

unfortunately most good public policy is just that. I also want to assure everyone that

the comp plan process is not over and there are many more meetings on the Plan

before final adoption. No final actions have been taken and I will be looking for ways for

us to come together around a plan we can adopt by the end of the year.




No one will see every policy or implementation program they want in the plan, but Iâ€™m

confident that the finished product will not be vastly ideologically different from the

current plan we have, and that it will accurately reflect our collective vision for Palo Alto

in 2030.
