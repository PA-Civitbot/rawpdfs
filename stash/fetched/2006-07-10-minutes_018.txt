recommendation to put the matter off until a new Library Director was in
place.

Council Member Mossar said she was not opposed to the amendment. Staff
was interested in pursuing the recommendations listed in the Colleague’s
Memo, dated July 10, 2006, but could not do anything until the Director was
on board. Facility improvements as well as technological improvements
needed to be pursued.

Mayor Kleinberg clarified the friendly amendment was to accept the
recommendations, which would be handled after a new Library Director was
selected.

Council Member Barton said that was correct.

Council Member Klein said he was not in favor of the friendly amendment
because staff urged the Council to go forward. Staff was asked about the
timeframe for a new Library Director.

Assistant City Manager Emily Harrison said there was no timeframe at the
current time. The Interim Library Director was the most technologically
knowledgeable of the current Library staff. City staff would work actively on
the memo.

Council Member Mossar did not accept the amendment.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION: Council Member Morton moved, seconded by
Barton, to delay action on the Colleague’s Memo until after a new Library
Director was in place.

Ms. Harrison said the Colleague’s Memo, dated July 10, 2006, asked staff to
return with an estimate of staff time and timeframe with the current staff.

Mayor Kleinberg said the recommendation in the Colleague’s Memo was to
direct staff to return to Council with a proposal which covered the four items
listed in the recommendation.

Ms. Harrison said staff would return with a proposal for the resources
required and the timeframe to complete the project.
