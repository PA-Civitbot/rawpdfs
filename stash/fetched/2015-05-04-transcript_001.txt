Special Orders of the Day

1.   Interview of Two Candidates for the Human Relations Commission.

Mayor Holman: Our first candidate is Alice Smith. You've probably seen this
enough that you know the routine. You'll have a minute or so to make any
opening comments if you want to. We'll have the rest of the time for Council
Member questions. Thank you.

Alice Smith: Thank you very much for interviewing me. I'm sorry I couldn't
see you before, but I was at a wedding in England which was extremely nice.
I'm interested in being on the Human Relations Commission (HRC), because
I loved being on the Library Bond Oversight Commission.             I think I
contributed with my skills and knowledge. I learned a lot. I've never
wanted to run for City Council or for any of the specific offices. I really do
believe that you should participate in your local government to the extent
that you have something to contribute. I think I might. I'd be happy to
answer any questions you have.

Council Member Kniss: Full disclosure, I've known Alice a really long time.
Alice, I think it would be great if you gave us some more background on
your involvement with local government and how you've been involved and
what your passions are.

Ms. Smith: When you say local government ...

Council Member Kniss: That's us.
