fun and interesting and a great chance to mix it up with people from all over
the state. After we got done at 1:00 last week, I know that Greg was back
up at 6:30 to drive to Sacramento to lobby for NCPA. You deserve at least a
kudo or two for doing that. It was great that you were willing to do that.
Thanks.

Mayor Holman: Council Member Scharff, thank you on our behalf. I did not
make it to World Music Day, because I was attending in San Francisco the
U.S. Conference of Mayors. I'll have more to share on that at a later time.
One of the real pleasures that I had at that conference was getting to meet
Ambassador Andrew Young and spending a little bit of time with him.

Adjournment: The meeting was adjourned in memory of all Charleston
shooting victims at 11:19 P.M.
