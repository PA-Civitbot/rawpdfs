they had a total of five weeks in order to proceed with the two functions of
the Substitute Motion of engaging the public and giving Staff adequate time
to compose the Ordinance.

Mr. Keene stated there was no need for a second reading on a fiscal
Ordinance. He stated there was a Council meeting on the July 27th and
asked the City Clerk if this was possible as an addition to the Agenda for that
meeting.

City Clerk, Donna Grider stated it was possible and the decision could be
made on July 27, 2009.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION FAILED: 2-6 Burt, Kishimoto, yes, Schmid absent

Council Member Yeh asked Staff for clarification on whether a BLT is
collected on an ongoing basis or a one-time basis during any given calendar
year.

Mr. Perez stated Staff had proposed a BLT collection on a one-time per year
basis.

Council Member Yeh asked if it was an 18-month loss, if they were on a 12-
month collection schedule which made it either January 2010, 2011 or 2012,
where the revenue ideally came in within the 30-day order and collections
period. He asked if this was a potential $4.5 - 6 million loss if the
anticipated revenue was approximately $3 million or was this just a $3
million loss.

Mr. Perez, in terms of the timeframe, stated the Finance Committee had
recommended the July 1, 2010 effective date with the collection in the
spring of 2011. If this went to the election of November 20, 2011, Council
Member Yeh’s question was whether or not it was possible to collect this in
the spring of 2012. He agreed with the City Attorney that this was possible
based on the returns of the prior year. Revenue received in the spring of
2012 was based on the collection amounts due from the calendar year of
2011.

Council Member Yeh clarified the impact, then, was not 1-1/2 years, but one
year’s worth of revenue since it was a one-time collection.

Mr. Perez stated, assuming that they were collecting on the full year in
January of 2012, this was correct.

Council Member Klein appreciated the correction but had also understood in
the Motion that the Blue Ribbon Task Force was to also become involved in
the City’s expense considerations.
