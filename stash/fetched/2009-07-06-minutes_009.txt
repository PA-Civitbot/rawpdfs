AMENDMENT: Council Member Yeh moved, seconded by Council Member
Schmid to appoint a subcommittee appointed by the Mayor to prepare a
manual for the UAC.

Council Member Burt stated the UAC candidates were exceptional; He felt it
would be beneficial to consider expanding the UAC. He stated more
consideration should be looked into when considering the pros and cons of
expanding the UAC. He indicated it would be beneficial to study new roles,
processes, and create clearer bylaws for the UAC.

Mayor Drekmeier stated the UAC had evolved in their responsibilities to
include utility rates, environmental matters, and climate protection. He
supported the Committee as more proactive by providing them with
challenging issues and tapping into the expertise of the commission
members. He felt creating a manual was not needed, however forming an
Ad Hoc Committee to meet with Staff to discuss expectations and roles
would be beneficial.
