musician and a poet. Clark’s contribution to the development of Palo
Alto’s Compost Program brought $100,000 in revenues and initiated
the free give-away compost to Palo Alto residents.

Cliff Akatiff spoke of his appreciation for being a City employee. As a
Palo Alto resident, he addressed three issues that faced the City
Council: traffic calming, waste management, and recycling facilities,
and restoration of the Juana Briones Property. He said the street
calming program caused excessive traffic on arterial roadways that
remained opened Currently there were no approved plans for
succession of waste disposal and recycling.         With the anticipated
closure of the landfill Facilities in 2010, Palo Alto would be losing a
valuable resource if waste were to be disposed of in neighboring city
facilities. He spoke of the Juana Briones Property, as an historical
artifact, and asked Council not to allow its destruction.
