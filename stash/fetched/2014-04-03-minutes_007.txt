Mayor Shepherd suggested booking dates on the tentative Agenda in order
to forego a poll.

Vice Mayor Kniss inquired whether CAOs were agreeable with the proposed
dates.

Chair Scharff answered yes.    Council Members had not responded to the
poll.

Mayor Shepherd asked if the City Auditor review could be scheduled the
same day as the City Manager review.

Ms. Lund explained that the City Auditor goal setting process would ideally
occur 90-120 days after the person began work.

Mayor Shepherd asked if she could place items on the tentative Agenda
without polling when the dates were so far in the future. A date for the City
Auditor could be placed on one of the proposed dates.

Chair Scharff preferred to poll for dates and place them on the tentative
Agenda.

Ms. Lund added that polling provided the names of Council Members who
could not attend. She could not change dates at the last minute after
holding a date for months and months.

Council Member Klein remarked that attendance by all nine Council Members
was not necessary.

Ms. Lund recalled past occasions when meeting dates were changed because
fewer than nine Council Members could be present.

Vice Mayor Kniss asked if Ms. Lund worked with other groups of nine.

Ms. Lund did not work with other Councils of nine members, but did work
with Joint Powers Authorities (JPA) of perhaps ten Board Members.

Chair Scharff would schedule another meeting of the Committee to review
the midyear process.

MOTION: Mayor Shepherd moved, seconded by Vice Mayor Kniss to
forward to the City Council to:
