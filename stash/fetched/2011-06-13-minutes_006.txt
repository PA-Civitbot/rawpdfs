Safety concessions. On May 2, 2011, Staff identified a $2.3 million gap in
the Long-range Financial Forecast that resulted from movements in revenues
and expenditures. The budget gap in December 2010 was $2.3 million and
by April 2011 increased to $3.2 million.         Departments made budget
adjustment totaling $1 million of which over $400,000 resulted from the
reorganization of the Public Works Department, $100,000 was added to the
contingency fund for innovation to develop ideas to help with efficiency and
budget savings, a $1 million placeholder for FY2013 healthcare and pension
costs, bringing the budget deficit to $4.2 million.        The Public Safety
concessions of $4.3 million would result in a balance of $131,000. He said
Sales Tax Revenues in FY2007 was $22.2 million, and declined to $18 million
in FY2010, with a projected increase of $20.2 million or a $2.2 million in
growth. The concern was expenditures had escalated upward and revenues
were $2 million below the FY2007 figure. Property Tax growth was 2
percent which was consistent with Santa Clara County (SCCO) and the Palo
Alto Unified School District (PAUSD) estimates. The concern was SCCO had
sent a reassessment value notification predominant in commercial properties
and could impact revenues. The City continued to work with the car
dealerships to determine the decline in dealerships sales. Utility users’ tax
was flat with a downturn in telephone usage tax. The Transit Occupancy Tax
(TOT) had an upward trend from 6.7 percent in 2007 and a projection of 8.2
percent in 2012. Documentary Transfer Tax had a slight increase at 4.3
percent.    No upward movements in revenues that matched the 2007
revenues. The non-Public Safety expenditures from 2002 to 2012 were flat
and the Public Safety budget had a 42 percent increase in the 2012 General
Fund. The Finance Committee initiated a $15,000 addition for public art
maintenance. The Council’s annual contingency fund was $250,000 and
proposed the same for 2012. He said $28,000 was moved from contingency
to fund the Human Services Resource Allocation Process (HSRAP)
Administration in the Department in the Community Services Division (CSD).
A different methodology was used to allocate City Council expenses because
Council salaries were considered a stipend rather than a salary that
impacted the Council’s budget versus the other City departments’ budgets.
The Council’s average healthcare cost was $12,000 and was allocated at that
level which reflected the increase of $124,000 in the Council’s actual
expenditure. The General Fund had a $500,000 placeholder to be used for
Capital Improvement Projects (CIP) and funds would be returned to the
Budget Stabilization Resource (BSR). Staff had recommended $65,000 for a
Foothill College Parking Revenue Program at the Cubberley site. The
program was not put forth and revenues were removed from the budget.
Staff proposed a $1 million placeholder for the Office of Emergency Services
(OES), and $167,000 was returned due to the addition of a Director and
non-salary increases for the program. Stanford reimbursements to the City
were 30.3 percent of expenditures in the Fire Department, the budget
