Council Member Mossar said she understood the intention of the Council was
to restore the public space at the Downtown Library. She questioned in
order to minimize the amount of administrative space at the Downtown
Library, which Option should occur at Mitchell Park.

Ms. Merkes said it can be either Option A or Option B with the program
expanded to include Technical Services.

Vice Mayor Klein said the building would be built to LEED silver standard but
he questioned the cost increase if it were built to the LEED gold standard.

Ms. Merkes said she would return with that information but estimated it
would be an additional 3 to 4 percent. The schematic design would be
prepared in January or February and the costs would be determined at that
time.

Vice Mayor Klein said if the single Option B was selected how long would
Mitchell Park Library be closed.

Ms. Merkes advised the single phase Option B would be located in the
parking lot and, therefore, the existing libraries may be able to stay
operational with limited parking.

Council Member Morton questioned the difference regarding what would be
left of Technical Services at the Downtown Library and what would be
installed at Mitchell Park Library.

Ms. Merkes advised approximately one third of the Downtown Library
building would be left for public use.

Kathy Page, Library Consultant, said functionally there would not be that
much difference between where it would be in the Downtown Library and
where it would be in the new Mitchell Park Library. There would be an
impact on the direct public services part of the Downtown branch.

Council Member Morton stated he believes Technical Services should be an
integral part of Mitchell Park Library since that is the site with the most
demand.

Council Member Kleinberg stated Technical Services does not need to be
accessible to the public and could be below ground with skylights.
