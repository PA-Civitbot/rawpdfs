Vice Mayor Shepherd believed the study was supposed to determine a salary
range and provide flexibility to reward good work. The City wanted a stream

Mr. Keene intended to have that conversation at another time.            Staff
discussed collecting information related to private sector jobs, but obtaining
information was difficult and complicated.
