Residents should not be penalized for wanting and needing to park close to
their homes.

Steven Woodward, 1655 Stanford Avenue, said he wished to encourage the
City to investigate the benefits of a residential parking permit program. This
program, as considered so far by the College Terrace Working Group,
includes the block-by-block buy-in and the availability of options that would
make it fairly easy for residents to have guests visit their homes without
incurring risk of parking tickets.

Greg Tanaka, 2290 Princeton Street, College Terrace Resident Association
President, said as a result of feedback from the neighborhood, the College
Terrace Board has voted to support resolving this problem.

Gary Fine, 2002 Columbia Street, said he finds Escondido School to be more
of a problem than Stanford. It is necessary to take responsibility for our
own choices and leave things alone.

Richard Tucker, Harvard Avenue, said he thinks the permit idea is extremely
poor. Out of town guests could get a $100 fine because their license
number has not been registered with the Palo Alto Police.

Mayor Kishimoto noted this agenda Item would be continued to August 6,
2007 and the public testimony was closed.
