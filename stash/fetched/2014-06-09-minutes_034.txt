Mayor Shepherd directed Staff to notice a Special Meeting for 6:00 P.M. on
June 18, 2014.

COUNCIL MEMBER QUESTIONS, COMMENTS AND ANNOUNCEMENTS

Council Member Klein had reservations about supporting Agenda Item
Number 5. He urged the Council not to grant an additional one-year
extension in 2015. If the organization could not complete fundraising in ten
years, then the City should identify another use for the building.

Mayor Shepherd attended the San Francisco Airport Roundtable Advisory
Group in an effort to obtain a seat for Palo Alto. One requirement for a seat
was that a city share a border with San Mateo County. She assumed Palo
Alto could continue its efforts to obtain a seat.

The Council convened into the Closed Session at 11:09 P.M.

Council Member Price left the meeting at 11:09 P.M.
