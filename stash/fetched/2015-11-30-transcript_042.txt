Mayor Holman: Thank you for that lead. If the Council's indulgence, shall
we ask the applicant ...

Council Member Scharff: I think applicant should move forward with our
direction as opposed to asking the applicant.

Mayor Holman: Asking what their preference is?

Council Member Scharff: Yes. I don't really see this as about what the
applicant wants. I see this as about moving forward and procedures that
produce the best project.

Male: (inaudible)

Mayor Holman: The applicant does have the option of withdrawing their
project. This is true.

Council Member Scharff: They can always withdraw it. I mean, they don't
have to. They could just let it go in limbo and withdraw it and let it die.

Mayor Holman: This is very true. The applicant does have options. Council
Member Wolbach, did you have your questions completed?

Council Member Wolbach: No. And actually my comments on the motion.
Just following up on this question. Just an encouragement to my colleagues
that when this does come back and as we're studying what comes back and
we're finishing crafting and voting on this motion, I hope that we're
preparing ourselves to make some final determinations, just so that we can
see a light at the end of the tunnel for everybody involved.

Mayor Holman: Vice Mayor Schmid.

Vice Mayor Schmid: I'd like to add one element to "C," that the findings
specifically include 18.76.020(d)(1).

Council Member Scharff: Could you repeat that, Greg?

Vice Mayor Schmid: (d)(1). The design is consistent and compatible with
applicable Elements of the Palo Alto Comprehensive Plan.

Council Member Scharff: Sure.

Council Member Berman: Sure.

Mayor Holman: That's accepted.
