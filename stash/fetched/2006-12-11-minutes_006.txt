Council Member Cordell stated the Colleagues Memo with Council Member
Klein and Drekmeier requested the City Council to establish a Taser Task
Force to recommend whether or not to allow the use of tasers by the Palo
Alto Police Department.

Council Member Mossar asked for clarification on expending funds from the
COPS fund.

Chief of Police Lynne Johnson stated the COPS fund was an annual allocation
provided through the State. The Council had to approve how the funds
would be used.

Council Member Mossar clarified if the use of tasers was declined, a different
proposal would be presented to the Council.

Chief Johnson confirmed.

Vice Mayor Kishimoto asked whether there would be a policy advisory group
in addition to the auditor. According to the process, the Council would see
the taser use policy.

Council Member Cordell stated the process was for the Task Force to inquire
and study whether tasers be used.

Vice Mayor Kishimoto asked whether the Task Force committee meeting
would be publicly noticed.

Council Member Cordell stated it was required that all meetings must be
publicly noticed.

City Attorney Gary Baum stated the committee would be set up as a Brown
Act Committee with an agenda.

Vice Mayor Kishimoto asked how many times the Police Department needed
to use force.

Chief Johnson stated there were five incidents in 2005 and eleven incidents
in 2004.

Council Member Morton asked whether a yes vote meant the funds were
guaranteed indefinitely.

City Manager Frank Benest said the funds would not be used if the Council
did not approve the taser program.
