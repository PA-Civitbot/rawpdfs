Mayor Burt: I think the Clerk may have the latest polling on the Planning
and Transportation Committee.

Ms. Minor: Mayor Burt, I do.

Second Round of voting for one position on the Planning and Transportation
Commission with a term ending December 15, 2020:

Voting For Przemek Gardias:         Burt, Scharff

Voting For Reshma Singh:            Berman, Wolbach

Voting For Doria Summa:             DuBois, Filseth, Holman, Kniss, Schmid

Ms. Minor: Doria Summa with five votes is appointed to the second full term
for the Planning and Transportation Commission. We'll do the unexpired
term.

Mayor Burt: Thank you.

[The Council returned to Oral Communications.]

Mayor Burt: Do we have a count ready?

Ms. Minor: I do.

Third Round of voting for one position on the Planning and Transportation
Commission with a term ending December 15, 2018:

Voting For Przemek Gardias:         Berman, Burt, DuBois, Filseth, Holman,
                                    Kniss, Scharff, Schmid, Wolbach

Ms. Minor: Rather than go through each of the individuals, everybody voted
Przemek Gardias.

Mayor Burt: We have three Planning Commissioners. Welcome to the new
Commissioners. We certainly had an outstanding candidate pool. We had
16 candidates. I think it was a very strong consensus of the Council that we
really valued the candidates who applied and hope that they will participate
in    either   future   applications   for   the    Commission   or    other
Boards/Commissions or other ad hoc ways to serve the community. We
thought it was a really exceptional candidate pool.

[The Council returned to Oral Communications.]
