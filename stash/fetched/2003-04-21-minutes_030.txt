Mayor Mossar replied no because that would require a two-thirds vote. Item
No. 19 would be left in place, the Public Hearing would be opened and
closed, and the matter would be continued after the Closed Session. That
enabled Council to hear from the public and Council received information
from staff they would need in Closed Session in order to hear Item No. 19.

PUBLIC HEARINGS

17.   Public Hearing: The City Council will hold a Public Hearing to consider,
      among other items, mid-year changes to the 2002-03 Municipal Fee
      Schedule, including the adoption of new fees, increasing existing fees,
      rates or assessments.

Council Member Morton said the Finance Committee unanimously approved
the item. The budget included some monies for the Roth building demolition
but not the additional amount that would be required to retain the spine.

MOTION: Council Member Morton moved, seconded by Burch, that the
Finance Committee recommend to the City Council re the 2002-03 Adjusted
Budget - Midyear Amendments and Capital Improvement Program Status,
adoption of a Budget Amendment Ordinance, which includes:

      a.   Proposed midyear adjustments to the 2002-03 Budget for the
           General Fund, Enterprise Funds, Special Revenue funds, Internal
           Service Funds, Debt Service Funds, and Capital Improvement
           Fund;
      b.   New or amended 2002-03 CIP Project Descriptions;
      c.   Amendments to the 2002-03 Adopted Municipal Fee Schedule;
           and
      d.   Amendments to the 2002-03 Table of Organization.

      Ordinance 4785 entitled “Ordinance of the Council of the City of Palo
      Alto Amending the Budget for The Fiscal Year 2002-03 to Adjust
      Budgeted Revenues and Expenditures in Accordance with the
      Recommendations in the Midyear Report”

Council Member Lytle said on page 5 of 9 of staff report (CMR:160:03), it
stated that an additional $30,050 for the Roth building was available. She
asked whether a motion was in order to adjust that amount to accommodate
the spine removal as part of the BAO.

Mayor Mossar said Council could not take that action without a BAO
approval, which required a two-thirds vote.
