Subject:   Mayor’s Ad Hoc Committee on Sales Tax Enhancement
_______________________________________________________

Our largest source of City revenue is the sales tax from retailers, service
providers and businesses. It is essential that we consider all reasonable steps to
protect and increase our local sales taxes.

In support of this objective, Mayor Beecham established the Mayor’s Ad Hoc
Retail Committee earlier this year. The Committee’s purpose was to provide
Council with recommendations to strengthen and support Palo Alto’s retail
sector. The Committee completed its work this fall and reported its
recommendations to Council. Council directed the City Manager to proceed in
implementing those recommendations.

That Committee’s recommendations were focused on policies and actions that
support Palo Alto’s 2800 existing retailers and service providers.

As a critical follow up to that Committee’s work, we are now establishing a new
ad hoc committee to identify and examine policies and administrative actions
appropriate to enhancing Palo Alto’s retail sales tax base by attracting the right
mix of new retail businesses to Palo Alto. This Committee will operate on a time-
limited basis. By Fall, 2005, the Committee will provide the City Council and City
Manager with specific recommendations for policy changes and/or administrative
actions to build our retail sales tax sectors. See the attachment for more details.

If you have any suggestions, please contact either of us.
