Mr. Bartel said for Fiscal Years 2011 and 2012 the amount would be
approximately $8.4 million if the City was only paying the benefits due to
retirees.

Vice Mayor Scharff said prior to the Actuarial Study the City was looking at
paying $9.4 million and now it was $13.3 million but on a pure cash flow
basis it would be at $8.4 million.

Mr. Bartel said that was correct.

Vice Mayor Scharff said on a cash basis there would have been an additional
$1 million paid off.

Mr. Bartel stated yes.

Vice Mayor Scharff said the current recommendation was to pay off an
additional $4 million.

Mr. Bartel said yes.

Vice Mayor Scharff said the Actuarial Study was a snapshot with changed
assumptions which was compiled every two-years. He asked if the
suggestion was in two-years things would remain as is with the City paying
the $13.3 million with no changes.

Mr. Bartel noted reality interfered with what the Actuary expected to occur.

Vice Mayor Scharff asked if the City did not pay the amount would they still
be fine on a cash flow basis.

Mr. Bartel agreed.

Vice Mayor Scharff asked if the City would still be paying down on the
amount if they continued to pay the $9 million as previously recommended.

Mr. Bartel said yes.

Vice Mayor Scharff said there was no obligation to pay more than $9 million.

Mr. Bartel clarified there was no legal requirement to pay a higher amount.
With that being said, the un-funded liability was due in large part because
there were employees who were no longer working for the City.

Vice Mayor Scharff noted soon the City would be paying more people to not
work in the City than to work.
