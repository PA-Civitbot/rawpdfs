Mr. Keene concurred.

Council Member Schmid noted Staff identified a set of sites to replace the
units contained in the proposed Maybell Avenue Project. He asked if
identification of those sites resolved any potential problem with the Housing
Element.

Tim Wong, Senior Planner, reported there was an issue with the Maybell
Project in the previous Housing Element; however, the Housing Element was
approved. The Maybell Avenue Project was no longer an issue in the context
of the Housing Element.

Council Member Schmid inquired whether Staff identified a substitute group
of units.

Mr. Wong explained that Staff identified substitute units, but they were not
necessary to meet requirements.

Council Member Holman suggested Staff draft a brief white paper regarding
funding sources and requirements for creation of an affordable housing
project and place it on the City's website for public information. Within the
new Housing Element, Staff was attempting to identify existing multi-family
developments that could be purchased and converted to affordable units.

Council Member Berman attempted to negotiate a compromise between
opponents of Measure D and PAHC. The community desperately needed
affordable housing.
