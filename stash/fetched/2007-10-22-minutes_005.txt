Council Member Barton stated he had conflict of interest on the item as he
has a client with property across the street from 1001 San Antonio Avenue

MOTION: Council Member Cordell moved, seconded by Mossar, to continue
the item until the applicant files the appropriate documents; the Planning
Department should return the item to Council in an expedited manner.

Assistant City Manager Emily Harrison stated the item would return in early
2008.

Council Member Morton asked whether Ciardella’s will continue to operate.

Director of Planning and Community Environment Steve Emslie stated
Ciardella’s had been instructed not to operate until the zoning was approved
and the staff level architectural review has been completed.

Council Member Morton asked whether the Applicant understood the
process.

Mr. Emslie stated the Applicant chose to move onto the site without the
proper land use permits.

Council Member Morton stated the County took over the site.

Mr. Emslie stated he was referring to the relocated site which was currently
owned by CalTrans.
