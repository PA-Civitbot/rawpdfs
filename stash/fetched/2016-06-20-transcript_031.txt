Mr. Mello:      There's a City-owned power substation that's along Park
Boulevard, on the other side of the tracks. I think in order to avoid
acquisition, I think using that would probably be—if we were going to stay in
the Loma Verde/Matadero Creek vicinity, I think the only way to avoid any
kind of right-of-way acquisition would be to somehow use that City
substation property.

Council Member DuBois: That was more Colorado. The Loma Verde straight
shot was the acquire property option.

Mr. Mello: Yeah. There's homes along the entire stretch of Park Boulevard
between the tracks. There would need to be property acquisition if you were
to come straight off Loma Verde.

Council Member DuBois: Thank you.

Mayor Burt: Council Member Filseth. Is that whose light it is?

Council Member Filseth: I think my question actually already got answered.
Thanks very much. It's too bad, because the Class IV bikeway on Loma
Verde looks really cool.

Mayor Burt: I had a few questions. One is the potential—the separated
crossing at Loma Verde over the tracks. Is that also envisioned in this
estimate to include crossing over Alma or would it be signalized at Alma?

Mr. Knowles: We looked at a couple of different configurations. One would
be to go actually—boring underneath Alma and the Caltrain tracks or doing
an at-grade crossing that would require some sort of signal. There are
(crosstalk).

Mayor Burt: An at-grade crossing on the tracks or you mean on Alma?

Mr. Knowles: On Alma Street.

Mayor Burt: The dollar amount that was used for the estimate, is that for
fully separated under Alma and Caltrain?

Mr. Knowles: We wanted to give you the most conservative (crosstalk).
