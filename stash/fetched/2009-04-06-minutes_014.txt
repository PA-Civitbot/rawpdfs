Council Member Burt stated the Executive Summary referred to the 2002
legislation which required suppliers to assess whether there was adequate
water supply to serve certain large scale projects. He asked whether that
was for both, normal and drought years.

Ms. Ratchye stated the requirement was for both types of years.

Council Member Burt stated the report showed in dry years the City did not
have adequate water supply to maintain itself and less with the project. He
asked for clarification on whether there was or was not adequate supply.

Ms. Ratchye stated there were plans in place in the Urban Water
Management to adjust the supply as necessary.

Council Member Burt stated the legislation of 2002 clearly stated the
requirement for adequate water supply during normal and dry years; Staff
had shown in their report there was not adequate supply prior to the project
and less with the completion of the project.
