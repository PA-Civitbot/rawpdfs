The Street Tree Plan followed California Avenue’s existing pattern and the overall
Street Tree Plan. The California Energy Code was scheduled to go into effect on
July 1, 2014; it impacted residential and non-residential design construction. The
City prepared a Climate Protection Plan in 2007, related to the Sustainability and
Climate Action Plan (S/CAP) that specified goals for Greenhouse gas reduction; the
City exceeded their goals and set new goals. The community emissions were
estimated at 34 percent below 1990 levels, and about 29 percent below 2005
levels. The new circumstances, new technology, and the rising bar of initiatives
called for a new CAP. Staff issued a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the Climate
Plan on June 2, 2014 and met with perspective bidders on June 9, 2014. The RFP
asked for three different greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction scenarios: 80 percent
by the year 2050; 80 percent by 2030; and 100 percent carbon free by 2025. The
Chili Cook Off was being held at Mitchell Park on July 4, 2014. The Fire
