want the BID to apply to them. The Committee should be limited to
15 members.

Mayor Mossar suggested approval of staff recommendations 2 and 3.

Council Member Freeman said a list would come to the Council. The
Council would determine how many would be on the Committee.

Council Member Ojakian agreed with Council Member Morton. He was
not concerned about a disproportionate Committee. His concern would
be managing the process, the number of individuals, and meeting the
timeline. The Committee should be limited to 15.

Vice Mayor Beecham said the BID was a good idea. The current
composition of the Ad Hoc Committee was three professionals of 12
members. A total of 15 members would be a good number for the
Committee.

Mayor Mossar suggested the Advisory Committee be appointed. The
Committee should return with suggestions of additional professional
representatives, including the ideal size and composition.

Council Member Lytle said a professional office was defined in the
Zoning Code. The categories and composition of the Committee
should be made as reflective as possible.

Council Member Kishimoto said the intent of the Committee would be
to come up with a proposal and a composition, which would be
successful.
