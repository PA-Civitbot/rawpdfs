Council Member Scharff recommended that the Staff Report be re-
agendized. It was his belief it should be looked at in a broader
context. The total contribution by the City was $9.3 million from the
General Fund. He stated land would be given to the applicant which
amounted to $3.5 million. He inquired how long the applicant had to
complete the Project, and whether the land would return to the City if
it the Project was not completed.

Mr. Williams stated Affordable Housing Funds paid $3.5 million to
purchase the property.

Council Member Scharff inquired whether the General Fund was
reimbursed $3.5 million by the Affordable Housing Fund.

Mr. Williams stated that was correct.

Council Member Scharff inquired whether the applicant currently
owned this property.

Mr. Larkin stated the City currently owned the former Palo Alto Utility
Substation (Substation) – 841 Alma Street – and the former Ole’s Auto
Repair Shop – 801 Alma Street.          The existing agreement would
transfer the property to the applicant.

Council Member Scharff inquired what would happen if the applicant
did not receive the anticipated financing.

Mr. Larkin stated the properties would revert back to the City if there
were no affordable housing projects built on them.

Council Member Scharff inquired whether there was a timeframe that
the Project was required to be completed by.

Mr. Larkin stated the prior agreement had a set timeframe and it
would not be modified.

Council Member Scharff stated the Palo Alto Unified School District
(PAUSD) had shared their concern with the City for capacity levels.
He asked if there was available data showing the number of school
aged youth due to the housing project.

Mr. Williams stated the 2009 Environmental Impact Report contained
this information.

Council Member Scharff inquired whether Staff had spoken to the
PAUSD recently.
