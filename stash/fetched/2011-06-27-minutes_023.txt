Kendra Hornbostel asked the Council not to proceed with the Letter of
Interest. She stated the project was too big for the site, and the traffic
congestion would undermine all efforts from the past two years to fix that
problem in south Palo Alto.

Claire Kirner spoke about the increase in households and children in Palo
Alto, and how that affected the requirement of schools and community
services. She stated a sale or lease to Foothill would be short sighted.

Elayne Groechel spoke about the dance studios at Cubberley and the length
of time they had been there. She stated the City must act as a protector of
its treasures, and if the land was sold or leased, at least insure there was a

Kathy Torgerson spoke about her enthusiasm for the opportunity to build an

Bob Moss urged the Council to offer only a lease to Foothill because
Cubberley will need to be reopened as a high school eventually, and what

Penny Ellison spoke about the parking issue if Foothill were to build a
regional junior college on Cubberley. She stated Foothill was not required to

Ken Horowitz stated that Foothill was offering the opportunity of a brand
new, state of the art facility allowing for a more diverse student body with
different needs. He stated that Foothill College would offer opportunities for
high school students as well. He suggested building a second story at the
existing high school. He stated that commuters to the college could walk or
use buses, so traffic would not become an issue.

Lynn Brown stated that top priority of the community was the School
