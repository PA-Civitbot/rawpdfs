amendment based on the proposed Ordinance that's before you. I will note
that your interim Ordinance does include, in addition to the waiver, an
exception for multifamily housing projects. If you thought an affordable
housing project was forthcoming and something that you wanted to
encourage, you could allow, in addition to the waivers and exceptions, the â€¦

Vice Mayor Kniss: It would need to come back to us as a Council?

Mr. Lait: What would need to come back to you?
