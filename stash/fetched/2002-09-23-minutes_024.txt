Park. The tennis courts at JLS were locked because of
nearby construction. The PAUSD had plans to rebuild the
courts. Staff would work with the PAUSD to upgrade the
courts.

Council    Member   Kleinberg   asked   about   the   size   of   the
courts.

Mr. Thiltgen said staff would make sure any courts that
were added would be built in a way to accommodate the right
size. Lights were not appropriate because the courts backed
up to homes.

Council Member Kleinberg clarified the courts at Cubberley
were to be lighted.

Mr. Thiltgen said that was correct. The courts at Cubberley
were located next to the school buildings and parking lot.

Council Member Kleinberg asked whether the existing courts
at Mitchell Park were lighted.

Mr. Thiltgen said that was correct. Lighting would be added
to a new court.

Council Member Kleinberg asked whether there were any
environmental issues that the Council should be aware of.

Mr. Thiltgen said there was enough land for two courts, but
a second court would encroach into the 100-foot setback
from the creek.

Council Member Kleinberg        asked   about   the   cost   of   one
additional tennis court.

Mr. Thiltgen said the $400,000 had to be used on two courts
in different locations. A second option that had not been
looked at was to add one more court at Cubberley. There was
space at Greer Park for tennis courts and space for an
additional court at JLS.

Council Member Kleinberg clarified that money would not be
spent on JLS and Cubberleyâ€™s courts.

Mr. Thiltgen said JLS and Cubberley were not included in
the $400,000 cost. The City had an agreement with the PAUSD
with regard to maintenance and capital work.
