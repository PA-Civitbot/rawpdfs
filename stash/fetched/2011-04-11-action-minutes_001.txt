STUDY SESSIONS

1.   Office of Emergency Services Study.

Arrietta Chakos, the City Manager's consultant from Urban Resilience Policy
Group, presented her report on the Office of Emergency Services (OES),
entitled: Toward a Resilient Future: A Review of Palo Alto's Emergency
Readiness. The report contained three core recommendations: 1) reclassify
the staff structure of the OES to have executive management level authority
across all City departments, 2) develop a new Emergency Operations Center
(EOC) facility, perhaps utilizing the new Mobile Emergency Operations
Center (MEOC), and 3) consolidate information from various technical
studies and other risk-related and infrastructure-related projects and
groups. The Palo Alto/Stanford Citizen Corps Council (CCC), as the
representative of all stakeholders, including Stanford University, the
business community, and others, will have a role in the implementation of
these recommendations.

2.   Update on City Sustainability and Environmental Initiatives Including a
     Report from the Community Environmental Action Partnership (CEAP).

Debra van Duynhoven, the Assistant to the City Manager for Sustainability,
reported on the many sustainability programs and initiatives in the City of
Palo Alto. She gave an update on the Climate Protection Plan and
                                                                  04/11/2011
