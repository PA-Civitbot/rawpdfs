COUNCIL MATTERS

6.   Resolution 8613 entitled “Support of the Endangered Species Act”

Council Member Drekmeier said the United States Senate had declared
Thursday, May 11, 2006, Endangered Species Day. Presently, there were
1,250 species on the Endangered Species list, most of which had their
populations stabilized or increased due to the recognition. The community
benefited in many different ways from biological diversity, i.e. food sources
and medicines.

MOTION: Council Member Drekmeier moved, seconded by Mossar, to
recommend that in honor of Endangered Species Day, the Council approve
the resolution put at places in support of the Endangered Species Act, and
that copies will be mailed to the congressional delegates.

Council Member Mossar understood there was some concern about the
Council taking up matters that were not of local issue. Palo Alto had
endangered species and was responsible for protecting them and other
species that could become endangered.

Council Member Klein indicated he would not support the motion because he
felt the Council should not take positions on national issues except in rare
situations.

Council Member Morton said nothing affected the fabric of the country like
its habitat. He encouraged his colleagues to support the motion.

Council Member Beecham concurred with the comments of Council Member
Klein.

Herb Borock, P.O. Box 632, supported the draft resolution for the ESA.

MOTION PASSED 6-2, Beecham, Klein voting no, Cordell absent.
