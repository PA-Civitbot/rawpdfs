AGENDA CHANGES, ADDITIONS, AND DELETION

Mayor Burt noted there had been discussion of moving the Consent Calendar
to the end of the meeting on July 12, 19 and 26, 2010 in order to have the
public discussion on the Stanford Hospital Development earlier in the
evening. The agenda process depicted the sequence of the Consent Calendar
be heard earlier in the meeting; therefore he was requesting the consent of
the Council to move the Consent Calendar forward on the previously
mentioned dates.

MOTION: Council Member Holman moved, seconded by Council Member
Yeh to move the Stanford agenda items forward on the Council agendas of
July 12, 2010, July 19, 2010, and July 26, 2010 before the Consent Calendar
and to continue Agenda Item No. 13 (former No. 10) to the Council meeting
of June 28, 2010.

Council Member Holman stated the Stanford Hospital Development was one
of the largest developments in the City and she felt it was significant the
public had ample opportunity to participate.

Council Member Schmid stated the key element was the Item Number in
sequence under Action Items rather than moving the Consent Calendar
which moved fairly quickly.

Vice Mayor Espinosa stated the purpose of the Motion was to move the
Stanford Hospital Development item in front of the Consent Calendar and all
other Action Items.

City Attorney, Gary Baum stated Council Member Klein should not be
participating in the vote.
