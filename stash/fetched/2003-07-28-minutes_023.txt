Council Member Freeman hoped consideration was given to the 100
new housing units in the SOFA 1 Plan and the retail they would be
supporting. She said she would accept the modification.

Mr. Emslie clarified that one difference between the Retail Protection
Ordinance Citywide and its application to SOFA 2 was automotive
services. Staff recommended that automotive service not be included
as one of the protective uses.

Council Member Kishimoto supported staff’s recommendation to not
include automotive service.

Council Member Freeman said automotive service was retail and what
would their options be if they were to change.

Ms. Grote said they could become an office or other permitted use.

Council Member Freeman said she could not support the second.

Council Member Kishimoto said she misunderstood and would allow
automotive service to change to recreation but not to office.

Vice Mayor Beecham clarified the Ground Floor Ordinance provided to
rebuild a building as long as the same retail square footage was kept
on the ground floor and could add other commercial space.

Ms. Furth replied that was correct.

Council Member Freeman said the Director of Planning and Community
Environment misstated.    It was not to go with the Planning
Department’s recommendation but to have ground floor retail on
Homer Avenue and Emerson Streets.

Council Member Kleinberg said she would like decisions made along
viable economic lines.

Council Member Lytle said because it was an historic and vital business
district she asked not to intervene with its progress, not to take away
the automotive service protection, and to keep the service in the
community.

Vice Mayor Beecham said the motion addressed the Homer/Emerson
Corridor. Staff recommended items d, e, f, and h of the staff report
(CMR:386:03) as replacement for ground floor retail in the corridor. If
