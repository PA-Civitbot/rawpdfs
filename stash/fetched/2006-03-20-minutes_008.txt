Mayor Kleinberg believed the golf course had broken even every year.

Mr. James said the golf course had broken even the last several years while
coming off a cycle of upgrading the course and a reduction in golf rounds. In
2005 there were approximately 73,000 rounds of play, with 82,000 rounds
projected in 2006 and, therefore, would do more than break even.

Mayor Kleinberg said so far the golf course had just broken even.

Mr. James said yes.

Council Member Mossar said one of the issues San Francisquito Creek
currently suffered from was the artificial course. She asked whether staff
had looked at the possibility the Creek would be realigned.

Director of Public Works Glenn Roberts said staff had not looked at golf
course redesign. However, staff did look at prior work done on the Creek
alternatives, such as channel widening, diversion and retention.

Council Member Mossar asked whether it was something staff would look at.

Mr. Roberts said yes.

Council Member Cordell asked whether it was appropriate for the PARC to
consider the proposal tentatively put forward that evening as well as any
other options.

Mr. Benest said staff did not have a problem with that.

Council Member Mossar recalled a decision the Council recently made not to
consider a proposal by a private developer on the police building, but rather
open it up to a bidding process.

Mr. Benest clarified he was not endorsing any specific vendor/provider, but
suggested looking at certain types of public/private ventures to augment the
facility given its goals and constraints.

Mayor Kleinberg said the intent of the original memorandum was that
everything be examined with no preference for any one in particular.

Council Member Klein said in the proposed plan, staff had criteria for
additional parking spaces beyond what was already located next to the
baseball stadium. He asked what established the criteria.
