Council Member Klein believed Staff's suggestion was consistent and
appropriate with the budgetary scheme; however, he did not understand
why it was included in the Motion.         Unused monies in the Council
Contingency Fund reverted to the reserves.

Council Member Holman understood Council Member Klein to say the
language should not have been included in Staff's recommendation, and
asked if he agreed with the Amendment to delete the language.

Council Member Klein responded yes, but for different reasons.

AMENDMENT WITHDRAWN

Council Member Berman felt this was a good short-term program. It was
important for the Council to monitor the program to determine its success.

MOTION PASSED: 8-0 Scharff absent

ADJOURNMENT: The meeting was adjourned at 10:21 P.M.
