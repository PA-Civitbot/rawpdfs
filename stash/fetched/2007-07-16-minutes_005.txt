Art Liberman, 751 Chimalus Drive, stated this emergency notification is a
tool, and the effectiveness of any tool depends upon its being used properly.
The Council needed to be sure solid procedures are in place.

Doug Moran clarified the issue of privacy. The system notifies addresses,
not people. A great deal of work has been done on notification aspects and
easily identifying geographic areas.

Council Member Morton inquired if anyone had talked to the Contra Costa
administration.

Ms. Contois said she had spoken with Contra Costa.

Council Member Drekmeier asked whether there were less costly vendors.

ranged from $5,000/year up to $132,000/year.

No action required.
