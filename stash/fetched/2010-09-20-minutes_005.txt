Ms. Eyerly stated there was a side yard or hard to serve on alley service
which was at a cost of $3.32 per month. She stated the goal was to have all
of the alley customers’ move to the standardized service so there would be
no need for the special trucks.

Council Member Shepherd stated there had not been a mandate to eliminate
the service.

Ms. Eyerly stated there had been internal discussions to that effect although
there had not been a consensus to move forward.

Council Member Shepherd asked how much the subsidy was for the mini-can
users.

Ms. Eyerly stated the cost differential between the $15.00 and the $20.00
can was approximately $250,000.

Council Member Shepherd asked what should the mini-can users have been
paying.

Ms. Eyerly stated the fee was $20.00.

Council Member Yeh asked if Staff knew the cost of service for each level of
service why was there a need for a Cost of Service Study.

Mr. Dornell stated the $20.00 rate in 2009 was based on the rate
calculations that were completed with the information that was available to
Staff at that time. The Cost of Service Study would assist Staff in
determining the number of customers utilizing which size can. The intent of
the Cost of Service Study was to target the cost for each service in 2010
dollars in order to insert the appropriate numbers to bring to Council.

Council Member Yeh stated at present time there was no definitive
subsidized rate information for any service level based on the current or
proposed rates.

Mr. Keene stated the proposal was being driven by an interim revenue
expenditure gap. He stated in an effort to close the gap, Staff proposed
changes to bring the mini-can closer to what the true cost of service was. He
noted between the years 2007–2009 the number of customers doubled who
used the 20-gallon can and he estimated that number would continue to
grow.
