      Rinconada Park Well Site, Fernando Well Site, Peers Park Well Site, and

Ms. Harrison said staff would like to return to the Council the issue of park
development as opposed to the park rehabilitation and improvement. The
Parks and Recreation Commission (PARC) had discussed the opportunity for
lighting and to upgrade the turf, which did not fit under park development
issues and asked to explore the choices with the Mayor.

Council Member Beecham offered to work with the Mayor on the issue.

Mayor Kishimoto asked if it would be back in time for the 2nd reading of the
ordinance.

Ms. Harrison said it could be possible.

MOTION PASSED 5-0, Cordell, Kleinberg, Klein, Mossar not participating.

item due to ownership of telecommunications stock in her mother-in-law’s
Trust Fund.

Jeff Hoel, 731 Colorado Avenue, said the City was not in favor of the Citywide
Fiber to the Home (FTTH) system because it could not afford the system. The
Dynamic City proposal revealed the City could afford the financing and the
project would be completed within three months.

Wayne Martin, 3687 Bryant, said half of the City was wired to accept the
system and needed to obtain regulatory permission from the City for the
special equipment.
