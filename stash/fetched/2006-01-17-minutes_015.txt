with Council Member Cordell that FTTH was a timing issue and the need to
remain competitive. She viewed the FTTH system as an economic base and
part of sustainable development without negative impacts on the
environment.

Council Member Klein suggested adding a directive for staff to keep adjacent
communities informed on progress of the RFP and for the Council to consult
with significant potential customers of the system in getting their input,
which may be more desirable than having staff do portions of the work.

Council Member Beecham said he along with other colleagues would be
willing to talk with neighboring cities, but would not ask staff to do so at this
point.

MOTION PASSED 5-1, Cordell voting no, Kleinberg, Morton, Mossar not
participating.
