Restoring our ecosystem, while that does say add it to the PTC version, I do
not believe the ecosystem is in the current Vision Statement. Is your
intention to add Bullet No. 3 to the current Vision Statement as part of your
amendment?

Council Member Wolbach: For now, let's stick with "2," "4" and "5." If we
want to add "3" later or somebody wants to make a case for that.

Mayor Holman: I thought you were talking about—maybe this was just
Council Member Scharff—adding Bullets No. 4 and 5 to Safety. I just want
to make sure we're all talking about the same thing.

Council Member Wolbach:       I'll withdraw my Motion for now.           I'll let
somebody else get a stab at this.

AMENDMENT:      Council Member Wolbach moved, seconded by Council
Member XX to add to the Motion, “with Staff to add language to the Vision
Statement based upon Council Member comments on April 27, 2015:

A.   Add language on “conservation” in the Vision Statement; and

B.   Add language to maintain sustainable water supply for the future; and

C.   Add language on Climate change adaptation and implementation.

AMENDMENT WITHDRAWN BY THE MAKER

Mayor Holman: You're withdrawing your amendment?

Council Member Wolbach: I'll withdraw my amendment.

Mayor Holman: I have a light from Council Member DuBois, and then
Council Member Filseth. Council Member DuBois.

Council Member DuBois: I'm sorry?

Mayor Holman: You had a light on.

Council Member DuBois: I agree with where we ended up. I think "4" and
"5" go to Safety. I think the other ones are covered.

Mayor Holman: Council Member Filseth.

Council Member Filseth: (inaudible)

Mayor Holman: Vice Mayor Schmid.
