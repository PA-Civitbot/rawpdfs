MOTION PASSED 9-0.

CONSENT CALENDAR

City Attorney Gary Baum commented the Statements of Interest (SOI)
process referred to in Item No. 4 was different than a bid process, which was
strictly based on the time of receipt. There was no competitive advantage to
the two bidders who submitted their bids five and ten minutes late. He urged
the Council to waive that minor irregularity and consider the two proposals.
It was not precedent setting and would not affect future SOIs.

Council Member Freeman moved, seconded by Kishimoto, to remove Item
No. 4 to become item No. 9A.

Council Member Cordell asked whether there was a competitive advantage
given to the SOIs, which were submitted after the deadline.

Mr. Baum said no additional SOIs had been submitted.

Council Member Morton asked whether the 3 p.m. deadline was standard.

Mr. Baum said it was standard.

MOTION: Council Member Morton moved, seconded by Mossar, to approve
Item Nos. 3 and 5 on the Consent Calendar.
