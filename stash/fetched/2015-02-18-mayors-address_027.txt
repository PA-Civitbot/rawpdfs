We started this with a series of numbers. There are a couple more numbers I want to
end with.

Slide 66,029

That is you. Palo Altans. Our residents.

Slide   “What is the City but the People” Shakespeare

And the other is number is

Slide 13

which is the number of years I have been in appointed or elected office and how many
years it has been my pleasure to serve the 66,029. It also happens to be the number of
women mayors Palo Alto has had, me being only the 13th.

Your voice still matters, just as it did last November. Use it this year to make this
a very special year, when we can reconnect with each other and reestablish our
connection as both Steward and Entrepreneur.

This is a community that breaks for squirrels and where demonstrations wait for the light
to change before crossing the street. A place I am proud to make my home.

To you, my fellow Palo Altans, whether resident or business, you have and continue to
inspire me with your love of this community.

I am honored by and thank you for this opportunity.

Thank you.
