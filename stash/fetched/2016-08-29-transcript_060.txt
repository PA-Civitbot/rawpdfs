     ii.        Remove ‘Remove constraints on the addition of ADUs;’ and

     iii.       Remove ‘development by right' language in Table 3.”

Mayor Burt: We may not want to accept them as a bundle. We may be
willing to accept certain ones.      I'll just give as an example—I don't
understand how the County expressway implementation would align with
Scenario 5 being sustainability tested. That's really what would normally be
thought of a sustainable approach by increasing road capacity for single
occupancy vehicles. That's an example.

Council Member DuBois: I'll speak to it if I get a second of if it's accepted.

Vice Mayor Scharff: Why don't you just do one at a time? That way you

Mayor Burt: I'd like you to propose them separately.
