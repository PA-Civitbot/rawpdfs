Mr. Marshall said the utility poles were deteriorating due to age and rot.

Council Member Ojakian asked what the difference was to the average
homeowner between replacing the poles and doing the undergrounding of the
wires.

Mr. Marshall said there was no charge to the homeowner to replace the utility
poles.

Council Member Ojakian asked what the difference in cost was to the City
between replacing the poles and doing the undergrounding of the wires.

Mr. Marshall said it was less expensive to replace the poles. It would cost the
City approximately $10,000 to $15,000 for the work the Utility Department
did in the street for each home. A pole serving four or five homes costs
approximately $5,000 per pole.

Council Member Ojakian asked what year undergrounding began.

Mr. Marshall said it began in 1965.

Council Member Ojakian asked what the timeframe was to underground the
entire City.

Mr. Marshall said there were various timeframes. There was a movement in
the early 80â€™s to accelerate to undergrounding, which went through a series of
Council meetings before going back to the original schedule of 60 to 70 years
for completion.

Council Member Ojakian said the original intent was to have a program that
would take a period of time because of the varying aspects.

Mr. Marshall said the City had to cooperate with SBC Communications who
had a limit on how much they could spend on undergrounding as set by the
California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC).

Council Member Ojakian said PG&E had a similar program, which was
discontinued.

Mr. Marshall said he believed the program was still in effect.

Council Member Ojakian said he did not believe PG&E was doing the program
at the same speed with which they had done so in the past.

Mr. Marshall said he could not really speak to the issue, but believed they
were still moving forward.
