                                                                                                             10.d




 1   the car loads up. You have enforcement mechanisms and other tools that you can use to deal
 2   with those and resolve those.

 4   So there aren’t any significant considerations that give me heartburn except for the growth that




                                                                                                                    Attachment: Attachment D: P&TC Excerpt Minutes of January 12, 2011 (1320 : California Avenue Neg Dec and CIP)
 5   will happen in the surrounding area, and we just don’t know what it is. We are
 6   contemporaneously doing the area plan and we don’t know what those densities are. We don’t
 7   know what the traffic generated will be. We don’t know what the increased population will be.
 8   We don’t know what the square footage of office space will be. We just don’t know what we are
 9   building one block away. I still have heartburn about that. Other than that I think you need to
10   work out all the bugs and we are definitely going the right direction.
11
12   As far as the CIP my questions earlier were not that I object to it. So I am perfectly supportive of
13   creating a new CIP account. I asked my questions so if there were any learnings for us to be able
14   to anticipate for the future so that we don’t have to do midcourse budget adjustments. I think
15   that would be better. That I don’t think is any reason not to proceed. Thank you.

17   Chair Tuma: Commissioner Tanaka.
18
19   Commissioner Tanaka: Thank you. So overall it seems like spending half a million dollars to
20   get $2.6 million of immediate benefit plus another half million dollars of annuity of savings
21   seems pretty compelling. So I want to thank Staff for bringing this project forward.
22
23   I note that there are concerns about we have the concept plan running in parallel to this program.
24   I wanted to ask the Planning Director in regards to what stage will this concept plan be done by
25   the time we actually start construction on this streetscape concept.
26
27   Mr. Williams: Well, hopefully the concept plan would have been approved by the Commission
28   and Council in a sort of tentative stage that would be then undergoing the environmental analysis
29   along with the rest of the Comprehensive Plan and the EIR that will be done for that. So the
30   concept plan itself by sometime later this year should be drafted or sort of accepted for the
31   environmental review details, and then it may be adjusted after that or may stay the same.
32
33   Commissioner Tanaka: Okay, so largely the concept plan will be done before the shovel hits the
34   ground on this project.
35
36   Mr. Williams: Right.
37
38   Commissioner Tanaka: Okay. I realize a lot of what we are contemplating for the concept plan
39   is increased density, but just based on your gut feel here because I know there is no analysis that
40   could be done at this point, would the parking for that increased density go on California Avenue
41   or potentially would you encourage it to go on the side streets?
42
43   Mr. Rodriguez: I will take a stab at that question first. Once the concept plan for California
44   Avenue is completed and the land uses are identified, the changes if any, a separate traffic
45   analysis will be completed in much more different detail than what we have done. It will look at
46   where the development occurs and where the likely trip generation will be. We will work with
