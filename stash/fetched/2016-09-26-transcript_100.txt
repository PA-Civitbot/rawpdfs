our golf course area. They're not able to do the main part of their
construction on the creek during this year. We're hoping that they will not
bifurcate the project and, thereby, impact our golf course construction.
There's follow-up. Assistant City Manager Ed Shikada is deeply involved in it
and other members of our Staff as well as the JPA and the Santa Clara
Valley Water District staff. That's ongoing. It's an important issue. Let's
see. At the Local Policy Maker Group, which is the policy advisory group for
the Caltrain electrification and now the High Speed Rail project, we had
discussion but not action on the initiative that I mentioned a month or two
ago to pursue an Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) grant that
would fund a system-wide study on grade separations. We'll be taking it up
again at our Board meeting and see what happens. Those are my updates.
On that note, the meeting's adjourned.

Adjournment: The meeting was adjourned at 11:00 P.M.
