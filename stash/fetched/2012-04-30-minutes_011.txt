Berkeley and Oakland had rates of $16; San Francisco's rate was even
higher with a tiered structure. All local jurisdictions throughout the State
received 1 percent sales tax, and each jurisdiction within a county could
increase the sales tax rate to a maximum of 2 percent. Barring increases
from the Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) and the County, the City
could increase the sales tax rate to 2 percent. A 1/8 percent increase would
result in a revenue increase of $2.7 million; a 1/4 percent increase would
provide $5.4 million. San Francisco was the exception to having 1 percent,
at 1 1/4 percent. Palo Alto did not have a parcel tax, but the Palo Alto
Unified School District (PAUSD) did. Typically, a parcel tax was increased for
a particular purpose. An increase had to be approved by a two-thirds vote,
and could be placed on the ballot during any election. With approximately
20,000 parcels in Palo Alto, a $25 parcel tax would generate $500,000 in
revenue; a $50 increase would generate $1 million. Palo Alto was one of the
few cities that did not have a Business License Tax. A general election and
majority vote would be required to pass a Business License Tax. Staff
projected the City could raise between $3 million and $5 million with a
Business License Tax. Usually, the tax was tailored for a certain revenue
level. The Council had used Certificates of Participation (COP) many times
for improvements. COPs did not require a vote, but did rely on either new
revenue streams or a reallocation of resources to pay the debt service. As a
rule of thumb, $1 million in debt service could generate $10-$12 million in
project funds over a 30-year term. COPs tended to have slightly higher
interest rates than General Obligation (GO) bonds, and thus provided a
lower yield. The City would need a $50 parcel tax, for example, to raise $1
million to pay a COP of around $10-$12 million. A sales tax increase could
generate much more than that, if needed. GO bonds required a two-thirds
voter approval. The City had implemented a parcel tax of $15.51 per
$100,000 in assessed value to pay the debt service on the $55.3 million
bond for the Library, Mitchell Park Community Center and Library, and
Downtown. For a $500,000 home in assessed value, the cost to the
homeowner was approximately $78. Funding for utility revenue bonds came
from utility rates, whether gas, water, or electric. These were dependent on
the interest rates at the time.

Mr. Keene noted the handout had a summary of election requirements.
Other than a GO bond election, all the other voter approval decision points
were at a general election, either November 2012 or November 2014. In
the timing of the 2012 election schedule, the Council had only May and June
to perform any background work. July 16 was the deadline for an ordinance
calling an election, which was a short period of time for community
outreach, education and campaign. For a general election in 2014, the
Council would need to prioritize infrastructure projects during the second
half of 2012, determine the feasibility of financing measures and a
communication plan in 2013, and develop formal recommendations and a
campaign in 2014. Staff wanted to place IBRC recommendations in the
