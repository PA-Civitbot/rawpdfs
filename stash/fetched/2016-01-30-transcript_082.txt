Mayor Burt: I'm sorry. You're talking about that winter break and not a winter
spring break week. Got you.

Council Member Kniss: (inaudible)

Vice Mayor Scharff: I can (inaudible) pull this off for December. Hold on a
second; I'll just get the calendar out, do it right. December 23rd is a Friday
next year. I think we could just basically break from December 24th, no that
wouldn't work. It's really the 26th to the 30th is the break.

Council Member Berman: It's a short break.

Mayor Burt: Isn't it normally two weeks?

Vice Mayor Scharff: If it's two weeks, do you want to do itâ€”so we should do it
the week before then, the 19th?

Council Member Berman: Can I ask a question of Staff?

Mayor Burt: Okay.

Council Member Berman: For some reason on my calendar, because it's a
combination of all sorts of calendars, it says that Monday, January 2nd, is New
Year's Day observed. Does the City Staff observe ...

Mayor Burt: You get a holiday.

Council Member Berman: Which is that Monday, the 2nd. It's got to really go
through that week then.

Vice Mayor Scharff: We want to take Monday the 2nd off and do it to the 3rd?
Are we doing it the 19th to the 2nd then?

Mayor Burt: Through the 2nd, let's see.

Vice Mayor Scharff: Or are we doing it through the 6th and then we have our
Council on the 9th?

Council Member Berman: On the 19th.

Vice Mayor Scharff: That's three weeks.

Council Member Berman: Not if you have the meeting on the 19th.

Mayor Burt: The 6th is a Monday, correct? You're saying.

Vice Mayor Scharff: The 9th. The 9th is a Monday and the 2nd is a Monday.
