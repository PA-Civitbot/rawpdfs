                               MINUTES
where further investigation could be needed and distinguish projects the
public had a clear opinion on.

Council Member Schmid inquired whether Mr. Metz expected four or five
projects would be dropped after the first survey.

Mr. Metz stated that was possible.

Council Member Schmid was skeptical that the quality of the data would be
good enough for the Council to make decisions.

Mr. Metz would work with the Committee to develop a questionnaire that
was concise, clear, and capable of providing actionable data.

Council Member Price asked if the initial survey would contain the broadest
questions.

Mr. Metz answered yes.

Council Member Price inquired whether the Committee would review the
questionnaire to ensure projects were not dismissed at the first stage.

Mr. Metz responded yes.

Council Member Price felt the public had varying degrees of understanding
and familiarity with projects, and the list was too long.

Vice Mayor Shepherd regretted that she did not vote in Committee to poll for
undergrounding utilities, and wanted to understand the importance of
parking garages to the community.         Polling was an analysis of the
community's interests and an indication of how the Council should spend its
time.

AMENDMENT FAILED: 4-5 Burt, Holman, Kniss, Schmid yes

AMENDMENT: Council Member Berman moved, seconded by Vice Mayor
Shepherd to remove “(accelerate resurfacing and Charleston/Arastradero)”
from the list.

Council Member Berman felt the Charleston/Arastradero Project was
controversial, and polling about it with street and sidewalk improvements
would not provide accurate information.
