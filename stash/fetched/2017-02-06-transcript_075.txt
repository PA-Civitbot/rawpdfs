Ms. Gitelman: That would be how we would implement this Motion. I guess
with the reiteration we would come back to you if we felt like the plan set we
got was trending off in another direction.

Mayor Scharff: That's fine.

Council Member DuBois: That's what I'm asking for.

MAKER AND SECONDER to add to the Motion, “this approval is subject to
the actual Project matching Option 1 as described by Staff.” (New Part E)

D.    Direct Staff to return with written findings for adoption; and

E.    This approval is subject to the actual Project matching Option 1 as
