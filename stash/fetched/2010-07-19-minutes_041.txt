MOTION AS AMENDED PASSED: 8-1 Yeh no

Council Member Shepherd asked the City Attorney if the Council could put a
tax initiative on the ballot to help fund the staffing for the firefighters.

Mr. Larkin said no, not in November 2010, because a general tax needed to
be placed on the General Municipal Election which occurred in odd-number
years.

CONSENT CALENDAR

MOTION:      Vice Mayor Espinosa moved, seconded by Council Member
Scharff to approve Agenda Item Nos. 9-14.

Council Member Holman said regarding Agenda Item No. 12, what did the
City receive in return for exchanging 79,000 square feet for 45,000 square
feet for the Public Access and Public Recreation Access Easements at the
Hyatt property at Stanford.

Director of Administrative Services, Lalo Perez said it was part of multiple
easements that were completed in 2002. A map was approved in 2002
which contained work done by a company who neglected to follow the map
and placed the trails in the wrong locations. The Hyatt and Stanford group
wanted to get the City’s approval on the change to modify the map. It
would change the existing public recreation access easement of 42,017
square feet to a new 45,529 square feet. The City gained 3,500 square feet
as a result of this change.

Mr. Keene said his understanding of Council Member Holman’s question dealt
with an issue that was decided in 2002 and an exchange had taken place.
The current issue was a housekeeping type correction of the map and as a
result, the action on the map was an adjustment that gained seeded land for
the City. He said he did not think the Council would be in a position to make
changes to the land difference.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to continue Agenda Item Number 14 to a date
uncertain.

Council Member Klein advised he would not be participating in Agenda Item
No. 12 as his wife in on faculty at Stanford.
