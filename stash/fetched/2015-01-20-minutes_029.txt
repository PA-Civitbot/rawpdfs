Ms. Shen explained a City Council Protocol document listed additional
compensation for the Mayor and Vice Mayor. That amount was different
from the amount contained in the Ordinance. Staff would not include
compensation for the Mayor and Vice Mayor in the Ordinance, but indicate
that compensation in a Resolution.

Ms. Stump indicated the proposed Ordinance eliminated the contradictory
language and provided the stipend would be determined by Resolution.

James Keene, City Manager, added that that would be a separate action.

Ms. Shen stated the stipend for the Mayor was $150 per month and for the
Vice Mayor $100 per month.

Mayor Holman remarked that that would not affect the current Mayor.
