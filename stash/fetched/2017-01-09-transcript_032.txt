Rita Vrhel, speaking regarding Agenda Item Number 10: I just wanted to
speak briefly on Item Number 10, the swim club. I read through part of the
document.      I was astounded to find out that the City is subsidizing
swimming lessons. If I read it correctly, they're subsidizing private lessons
$26 a lesson and regular swimming lessons $11 a lesson. I hope I read it
correctly; I hope I'm not misleading you. I'm not sure why when this
document discusses the increased need and demand for swimming programs
that the City's General Fund has to pay a subsidy. I'm sure that a lot of the
kids who take swimming lessons can afford to pay for them. I'm sure some
children or adults cannot. I think there should be a special scholarship set
up for them or some sort of way that everyone is able to take swimming
lessons but not at a City subsidy. I helped the community garden over at
Eleanor Pardee Park. When I attended a meeting on an increase in fees on
community gardens several years ago, I thought I heard that the City had a
new policy which was that the people who benefit from the services directly,
like the gardeners, had to pay their way, that the City could not subsidize
them. The distinction was made between the community gardens and the
City Library, where the community gardens are only open to a certain
number of people because the community garden plots are limited; whereas,
the City Libraries are open to everyone. I think the same thing about the
swimming lessons. I just donâ€™t understand in this City why a subsidy
continues. Thank you.
