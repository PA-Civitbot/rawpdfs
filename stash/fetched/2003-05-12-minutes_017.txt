MOTION PASSED 8-0, Morton "not participating."

Mayor Mossar said staff requested Item No. 12 be removed from the
Agenda.

City Attorney Ariel Calonne said the San Francisco Bay Regional Water
Quality Control Board (Regional Board) submitted a letter extending the
compliance deadline from July 15, 2003 to October 2003. Staff wanted to
evaluate what that meant before having the Council act on the ordinance.

MOTION: Council Member Kleinberg moved, seconded by Lytle, that Item
No. 12 be removed from agenda at the request of staff.

MOTION PASSED 9-0.

RECESS: 9:20 p.m. to 9:30 p.m.

REPORTS OF OFFICIALS

10.   Proposed Milestones for Council "Top 5" Priorities Fiscal Year 2003-05

Mayor Mossar said the proposed milestones included in the staff report
(CMR244:03) had been budgeted, were staffed, and were manageable in the
timeframes indicated. If any of her colleagues chose to make additions to
the list, other items would need to be removed.

Assistant City Manager Emily Harrison noted corrections to the Infrastructure
portion of Attachment 1 (CMR:244:03). The estimated completion dates for
the Parking Structures: Lot R and Lots S/L were September 2003 and
November 2003, respectively. The Roth Building demolition would occur in
June 2003 and the Joint Powers Authority (JPA) short-term objectives would
take place in June 2003.

Council Member Lytle referred to Page 5 of Attachment 2 (CMR:244:03)
regarding the study of options to enhance recreations and field space. She
did not see any information addressing the issue in the draft budget and
asked for an explanation.

Ms. Harrison said staff was still working on the budget document when it had
to go to print. The intent was to provide a presentation at the Finance
Committee meeting that was part of the discussion of the overall Capital
Improvement Program (CIP) scheduled for May 20, 2003.

City Manager Frank Benest said there would be recommendations coming
from the discussions with appropriate funding.
