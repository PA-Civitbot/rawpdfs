Summary

The Palo Alto RWQCP source control program for dental offices has been active
for the past decade. This cooperative effort with the local dental community has
been successful in diverting an estimated 5.1 kg/yr from being discharged into
the sanitary sewer system. For the entire service area the program is estimated
to have an annual cost in the range of $100,000, which consists mostly of
expenses for maintaining amalgam separator units. This range in annual costs is
equivalent to $18 million per ton of mercury diverted from the sewer system.


Estimate Calculations

Step 1 - Number of Dental Offices

The RWQCP has 135 dental practices in its service area that perform amalgam
placement or removal procedures. These practices are served by 116 vacuum
systems that each have an amalgam separator installed.
