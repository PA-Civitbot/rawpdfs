7.       Ordinance 4778 entitled "Ordinance of the Council of the City of Palo
         Alto Amending Chapter 9.10 of Title 9 (Peace, Morals, and Safety) of
         the Palo Alto Municipal Code Regulating Noise in Order to Clarify the
         Restrictions on Construction, Demolition, or Repair Activities and the
         Restrictions on Public Street Cleaning in Business Districts" (1st Reading
         1/21/03, Passed 5-4, Freeman, Kishimoto, Kleinberg, Lytle "no.") Item continued from February 3, 2003


MOTION: Council Member Burch moved, seconded by Morton, to approve
the staff recommendation to amend Palo Alto Municipal Code Section 9.10 in
the following manner:

     •   Section 9.10.060(k)(1) be amended to include business district
         sidewalk cleaning; and
     •   Section 9.10.060(b) be amended to indicate that the requirements for
         construction in nonresidential areas, which is authorized by valid City
         building permits shall be the same as those for residential areas.

Council Member Freeman said she initiated removing the item from the
Consent Calendar on January 21, 2003. A substitute motion would not
affect the City or the business owners but would be beneficial to the
neighbors, based on the PAMC, which read “It is hereby declared to be the
policy of the City that the peace, health, safety, and welfare of the citizens
of Palo Alto require protection from excessive, unnecessary and
unreasonable noises from any and all sources in the community. It is the
intention of the City Council to control the adverse effect of such noise
sources on the citizens under any condition of use especially those
conditions of use which have the most severe impact upon any person.”

SUBSTITUTE MOTION: Council Member Freeman moved, seconded by
Kleinberg, to amend the ordinance to ask staff to review possibilities of
restricting only private cleaning limiting either days of week for sidewalk
cleaning with the Green Machine, which is allowed in the California Avenue
Business District; discuss the hours restrictions with the California Avenue
Business District owners; return to the Council with those results; and bring
the ordinance back for a first reading.

Mayor Mossar clarified Council Member Freeman made suggestions for future
amendments to be brought back to the Council for consideration.

Council Member Freeman said her comments were based on instructions by
the City Attorney earlier in the day.
