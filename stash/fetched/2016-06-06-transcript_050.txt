Mayor Burt: So that a new project would, as a whole, not exacerbate the
jobs/housing imbalance.

Council Member Wolbach: Correct. Would that be amenable?

Vice Mayor Scharff: No. I'll tell you why. This is for not just Palo Alto; this
is for all communities in California.    A lot of communities don't have
jobs/housing imbalances. A lot of communities want jobs. Take San Jose
for instance. They don't have a jobs/housing imbalance in their community,
but maybe in the region. I just think that's so Palo Alto-specific and our
mindset right now.

Mayor Burt: Can I offer though that it's not about general development. It's
about projects that are exempt from CEQA for the purpose of improving the
housing shortfall.

Council Member Wolbach: How about this? What if I added to the end of
the sentence "where such exists, as in Palo Alto"? It would be where
relevant. It wouldn't apply to, say, Tracy or Modesto.

Mayor Burt: You're getting at whether a citywide circumstance exists as
opposed to whether a project that is exempt from CEQA should not
exacerbate, in itselfâ€”it shouldn't create more jobs than provide housing, if
the whole purpose is to reduce the housing problem.

Council Member Wolbach: Where relevant.

Mayor Burt:    We don't have to capture all of it.        That would be my
perspective.

Vice Mayor Scharff: I think we're getting far afield. The more things we put
in here, the less impact we're going to have, frankly, if we have a
(inaudible). I'm not going to accept it.

Mayor Burt: Council Member Schmid.

Council Member Wolbach: Actually, I ...

Mayor Burt: Sorry.

Council Member Wolbach: I wanted to see if there was a second to that,
and then I had one other suggestion for a minor change. Any second?

Mayor Burt: I will second it, but I hesitate. I don't want to get us into a
protracted debate.
