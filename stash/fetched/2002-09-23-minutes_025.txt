Council Member Morton asked whether there were any
conditions in which one tennis court could encroach into
the 100-foot setback from the creek.

Mr. Thiltgen said there was a variance possibility, but the
City needed County permission to encroach.

Council Member Kleinberg said the Colleague’s Memo, dated
September 19, 2002, asked for architectural design options
to be reviewed and considered in an open process. The
question was asked as to who had the final vote.

Mr. Calonne said the Architectural Review Board (ARB)
usually made recommendations to the Planning Director.

Council Member Kleinberg clarified the Planning Director
had the final vote.

Mr. Calonne   said   that   was   correct   unless   there   was   an
appeal.

Mr. Benest said a recommendation on a major City facility
went to the Commissioners, ARB, and the Council. The
process was open with much input.

Council Member Kishimoto said she voted for the modified
version when it came before the Council in the spring of
2002. In June, she supported the version that the Council
agreed on. She supported the modified version.

Council Member Burch said there was no comparison between
the current plan and the modified plan in the way the
building looked in the park. The people who designed the
current plan worked over one year with residents of south
Palo Alto. People who had concerns were misled or
misinformed. The second point of the Colleague’s Memo,
dated September 19, 2002, said “Develop architectural
design options for the exterior of the building, to be
reviewed and considered in an open public evaluation
process.” The Council was committed to do that. There were
concepts and site plans but no design of the building. The
Council’s job was to direct the process, listen to the
people, and make decisions. The Council should concentrate
on what it would get from the project rather than what
would be lost.
