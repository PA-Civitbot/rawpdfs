                         TRANSCRIPT
About 65 minutes ago, my telephone rang. I was one of the citizens that
has been chosen for the Transportation Tax poll. I went through a litany of
very good questions that are being asked the public on what they think
about this, what they think about that. Needless to say, the foundation for
part ofâ€”one of the tax options is a business head tax based upon the
integrity and vitality of the Business Registry. I'll close on that comment. I
think the Business Registry has a real future for this City and for the
residents to solve problems and set policy, but the City Staff are fighting
with one hand tied behind their back with lack of resources. I hope you and
the Finance Committee will pay careful attention to it. I have poured over
the integrity of the data. We could go on more than Jeff mentioned. You
don't want to dig too deeply in it. Thanks.

Mayor Burt: That you. That concludes our Oral Communications.
