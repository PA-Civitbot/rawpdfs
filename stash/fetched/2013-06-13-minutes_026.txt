INCORPORATED INTO THE MOITON WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to formally refer to the Policy and Services
Committee a proposal to split off Avenidas and PACCC from Human Services
Resource Allocation Process process.

Mr. Keene noted the base funding amount for HSRAP would change if the
Motion was adopted.

Ms. Oâ€™Nan reported the HRC considered splitting off Avenidas and PACCC in
the past. The concern was that the smaller agencies would be overlooked
when larger agencies were removed. The smaller agencies provided critical
services to the community.

Council Member Holman asked how PACCC and Avenidas would be funded if
they were not part of HSRAP.

Mr. Keene explained they would be funded through a separate grant fund.

Council Member Holman inquired whether Staff was anticipating a funding
process.

Mr. Keene replied no. The City would provide PACCC and Avenidas, as
external agencies, with funds through some process.

Ms. Van Der Zwaag reported a similar process happened with the Palo Alto
Mediation Program.      Similarly, PACCC and Avenidas could be general
services contractors with the Community Services Department.

Council Member Holman inquired whether baseline funding for HSRAP should
be removed from the Motion.

Mr. Keene responded no, because the Council did             not      have       a
recommendation from the Policy and Services Committee.

Council Member Schmid asked if HSRAP funding originated from a U.S.
Housing and Urban Development (HUD) or U.S. Health and Human Services
(HHS) grant.

Mr. Perez explained $1.2 million was provided by the General Fund.
Additional funds could be provided through the Community Development
Block Grant (CDBG) program.
