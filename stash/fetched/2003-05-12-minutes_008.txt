Morton had a conflict of interest in the portion of the item that dealt with
Adolescent Counseling Services.

Mr. Calonne said the Council would have to do a structured process to find
out whether there was an issue. The process involved severing the item that
Council Member Morton was conflicted on.

Mayor Mossar asked her colleagues whether they would be willing to take
action on the Adolescent Counseling Services (Caravan House Rehab)
funding request in the amount of $111,197 for Fiscal Year 2003-04.

MOTION: Council Member Kleinberg moved, seconded by Beecham, to
separate out Adolescent Counseling Services (Caravan House Rehab) from
the rest of the items for consideration.

Mayor Mossar asked whether public testimony could be taken on the
applicant agencies together or separately.

Mr. Calonne said the Council should take public testimony only as to the
Adolescent Counseling Services.

Council Member Morton said he had provided services to the Urban Ministry
in the past 18 months and requested they be separated out as well.

Mayor Mossar asked whether the cutoff for conflict was 12 months.

Mr. Calonne said that was correct. If fee income had not been received in
the past 12 months then there would not be a conflict of interest.

Council Member Morton said he could not immediately say whether he had
or had not received fee income from Urban Ministry within the past 12
months.

Mr. Calonne said the request was legitimate.

INCORPORATED INTO MOTION BY MAKER AND SECONDER to also
separate out Urban Ministry (Homeless Drop-in Center).

MOTION PASSED 9-0.

Mayor Mossar opened the Public Hearing and hearing no requests to speak
declared the Public Hearing closed.

MOTION: Council Member Burch moved, seconded by Freeman, to approve
Adolescent Counseling Services and Urban Ministry for funding.

MOTION PASSED 8-0, Morton "not participating."
