Mr. Williams stated yes.

Council Member Burt inquired on the additional start-up cost for the entire
balance of the College Terrace neighborhood.

Ms. Yazdy stated $95,000. She indicated 900 additional households would
require additional Staff members from Revenue Collections and the Police
Department.

Council Member Burt inquired on the start-up cost for the RPPP as
proposed.

Ms. Yazdy stated $47,000.

Council Member Burt stated there was enough money budgeted if the
entire College Terrace neighborhood opted to participate in the RPPP. He
inquired whether the College Terrace neighborhood was the only
neighborhood in the State that was adjacent to a university that did not
have a RPPP.

Kimley-Horn and Associates Inc., consultant Mike Mowery, stated every
city surveyed had a RPPP.

Council Member Burt inquired on the pick-up locations of the Stanford
shuttle that serve the College Terrace neighborhood.

Ms. Yazdy stated Stanford Avenue, California Avenue, Hale Street, and
Bowdoin Street have pick-up locations.

Council Member Burt inquired whether there was a discussion on relocating
the Stanford shuttle within the College Terrace neighborhood. He felt
convenient stops for residents, rather than students parking in the College
Terrace neighborhood, should be reviewed.

Mr. Williams stated Staff would look into this.

Council Member Klein inquired why the cost for permits for the College
Terrace neighborhood may increase if additional neighborhoods requested
to implement their own RPPP.

Mr. Williams stated additional residential parking permit programs would
require added costs due to the additional Staff needed to administer and
enforce the programs.
