STUDY SESSION

3.    Comprehensive Reusable Bag Program and Related Actions on Plastics
      and Polystyrene.

Manager of Environmental Compliance Phil Bobel gave a presentation on the
Cityâ€™s Comprehensive Reusable Bag Program. He stated that the City
Council will be asked to consider restrictions on plastic bags and expanded
polystyrene (styrofoam) in a series of phases beginning in December 2008.
These actions are being developed because styrofoam and other plastics
make up a substantial portion of the waste stream, and are an even greater
fraction of the litter found in local creeks. Plastic bags and Styrofoam break
apart into small pieces and become part of local and ocean ecosystems
