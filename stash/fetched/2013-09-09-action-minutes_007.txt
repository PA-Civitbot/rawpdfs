Council Member Holman asked that Staff bring to Council a review of the
findings that are required of the Architectural Review Board and a standard
for compatibility.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER for Staff to bring to Council a review of the
findings that are required of the Architectural Review Board and a standard
for compatibility.

Council Member Schmid asked if the report Staff was working on would
include the comprehensive downtown parking study.

Ms. Stump said no. This report would come in advance of that and would,
on an interim basis, suspend the use of certain parking exceptions pending a
larger conversation by Council.

NO VOTE REQUIRED
