     SPECIAL ORDERS OF THE DAY

     2.    Proclamation Honoring David Smernoff for His Work at the Enid
           W. Pearson Arastradero Preserve

     David Smernoff thanked everyone for their participation in the public-private
     partnership program essential in protecting valuable open space.          He
     encouraged Palo Alto residents and other communities who enjoyed open
     space to engage in community stewardship and to use the program as a
     model and view open space as part of infrastructure.

     Mayor Kishimoto said the Gateway was not funded by Capital Improvement
     Project (CIP) monies and had zero financial impact as well as zero
     environmental impact. It was an educational facility and would be of benefit
     to educate the next generation on open space stewardship.
