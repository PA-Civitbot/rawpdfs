Council Member Scharff asked if 25 percent office was allowed on the ground
floor along University Avenue.

Ms. Gitelman answered yes.

Ms. French clarified that 25 percent office was allowed in the rear of the
building, not the front-facing part of the building.

Council Member Scharff inquired whether that provision was contained in the
ordinance as well.

Ms. French reported it was contained in the current ordinance.

Council Member Scharff asked if the 25 percent office applied to side streets
as well as California Avenue.

Ms. French noted some side streets were subject to the GF overlay.

Council Member Scharff asked if the Wells Fargo Building Downtown

ground-floor financial services in the GF Zone.

Council Member Scharff asked if a Conditional Use Permit had to be
renewed.

Ms. French explained that some Conditional Use Permits ran with the land.
If the use did not change, then the Conditional Use Permit continued.

Council Member Scharff asked if the Council could eliminate existing
Conditional Use Permits. He wanted to know if the Council could force the
Wells Fargo Building to provide retail space.

Ms. Gitelman did not believe the Council could eliminate a use that had been
granted. The Conditional Use Permit would cease only if the building ceased

Council Member Scharff suggested the Council could amortize it.
