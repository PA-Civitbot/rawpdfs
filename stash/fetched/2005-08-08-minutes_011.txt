Council Member Cordell asked how many specific kinds of identified sites were
being considered.

Mr. Emslie said there were a few additional sites being considered.

Council Member Cordell asked that the MSC map attachment be placed on the
web.

Council Member Kishimoto asked whether there were any obligations under
the Animal Shelter agreements.

Mr. Roberts said there were obligations to the partner cities, which included
expanding the Animal Shelter.

Council Member Kishimoto asked to what location would the MSC and the
Animal Shelter be moved.

Mr. Roberts said he did not know.

Council Member Kishimoto said she was concerned about losing public facility
land. She asked whether the maker would consider an amendment to state
there should not be a net loss of public facility.

Mayor Burch said the maker indicated she would not consider the amendment
to the motion.

Council Member Freeman said she believed there were other ways of
generating tax without building auto malls.

Mayor Burch said the auto dealerships had indicated the site would be ideal.
Negative reactions were premature until more information was received.

Council Member Mossar stated she had trouble envisioning an auto mall that
is compatible with the Baylands Master Plan, but she agreed it was an
important proposal to study in an effort to keep auto dealerships in Palo Alto.

Vice Mayor Kleinberg said there was no anticipation that any of the Cityâ€™s
values would be diminished.

Mr. Emslie said the site was difficult and there was no easy solution to the
problem, but it met many of the desirable qualities for the auto dealers.

Council Member Mossar asked about signage for the auto dealers.

Mr. Emslie said the site was considered freeway frontage, which diminished
the need for more remote or higher signs to provide visibility.        The
architecture itself could become the signage.
