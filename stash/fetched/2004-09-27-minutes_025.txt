Vice Mayor Burch clarified when bicyclists came out of the Tunnel traveling
eastbound, they could turn left to Forest Avenue, turn right to Channing
Avenue, or keep straight. The motion did not specify which direction a
bicyclist could go, only that the traffic signal would be changed to allow
bicyclists and pedestrians to proceed to their destination.

Council Member Cordell said in her observation vehicles did not adhere to
the 25 mile per hour speed limit, but traveled at a faster speed. She hoped
staff would consider a bike lane on Alma Street, as Council Member Mossar
previously mentioned. She also asked for staff to closely monitor the timing
of the traffic signal. Perhaps 20 seconds was not enough time. She
expressed her support for main motion.

Council Member Morton said he would be more comfortable with the main
motion if the Council were to revisit the issue after 800 High Street was
completed.

Mayor Beecham expressed his opposition to the substitute motion.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION FAILED 3-5, Kishimoto, Morton, Mossar yes,
Freeman not participating.

INCORPORATED INTO MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE MAKER
AND SECONDER that Council would revisit the issue after 800 High Street
is completed to review other options.

Council Member Kleinberg said she hoped the staff would work with the Paly
High School PTA to make sure the Tunnel was safe for the students.

Council Member Kishimoto asked whether taking out parking spaces on Alma
Street was a viable option.

Mr. Kott said staff was reluctant to remove parking in the downtown area,
but they would take a look at it.

Council Member Mossar said it was an irresponsible act for the Council not to
make sure bicyclists had a safe and protected travel lane on Alma Street,
and she could not support the motion.

MOTION PASSED 6-2, Morton, Mossar no, Freeman not participating
