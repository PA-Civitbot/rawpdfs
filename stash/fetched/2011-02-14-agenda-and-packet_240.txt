                                                                                                              10.d




 1   Chair Tuma: Thank you. Excuse me I think Terry one of the Commissioners has a question for
 2   you.

 4   Commissioner Keller: So was you statement an official position of the Palo Alto Central




                                                                                                                     Attachment: Attachment D: P&TC Excerpt Minutes of January 12, 2011 (1320 : California Avenue Neg Dec and CIP)
 5   Homeowners Association or …? When you said ‘we’ I was just wonder exactly what the scope
 6   of ‘we’ was.
 7
 8   Mr. Holzemer: Yes, I am here representing the majority of our Board. Yes.
 9
10   Commissioner Keller: Okay, thank you.
11
12   Chair Tuma: I think there is one more question for you, if you don’t mind. Commissioner
13   Garber.
14
15   Commissioner Garber: There is. I had another question for you. You had mentioned that the
16   only thing – the only thing that I heard you say that your Board wanted was the repavement of
17   the street. Is there anything else?
18
19   Mr. Holzemer: Well, we talked about in the early City meetings that we liked some of the
20   concept ideas. I think Jaime mentioned I am sure in his presentation about the signs out on front
21   of El Camino Real, and drawing attention to California Avenue. I think he talked about some of
22   the other street improvements. I think those would be great ideas, and I think they would be very
23   welcome by the business community. I think the primary sticking point is the four lanes to two
24   lanes.
25
26   Commissioner Garber: Thank you.
27
28   Chair Tuma: Thank you. Our next speaker is Cedric De La Beaujardiere followed by Fred
29   Balin. I apologize for butchering your name. We have heard that over and over. With a name
30   like mine I am used to that from my end.
31
32   Mr. Cedric De La Beaujardiere, Palo Alto: Thanks, no problem. I am here to support the Staff
33   recommendation. I support this plan. I am the current Chair of the Bicycle Advisory
34   Committee. We have reviewed the plan and it has incorporated the recommendations that we
35   made to Jaime and his team. We think that the configuration is safe for bicycles. You have 16
36   feet here, a typical bike lane is five feet. A very wide lane in a street would be 11 feet. So at 16
37   feet you have plenty of room. The charros tell the bikes and the cars where to be so it is really
38   not a problem for bikes, and the Bicycle Committee does support this plan.
39
40   As an individual I wanted to point out, and as part of PABAC too, the lane reductions are safer
41   for pedestrians. The number one cause of vehicle/pedestrian conflicts is when a pedestrian
42   crosses a road with more than one lane in each direction. So at the mid-block crossings, which
43   are not controlled by any stop sign having a reduction in lanes is a great improvement for safety
44   for pedestrians, as well as having them be raised crosswalks. It will slow down the cars.
