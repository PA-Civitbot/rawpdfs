Temporary staffing increased 31, almost 32 percent from 95 to 125
employees. In the General Fund, you can see where some of that cost went,
that cost increase, despite the staffing decreases. That is on employee
costs. Salary increases were 1.9 percent, but overtime increased 2.2
percent and employee benefits increased 30 percent from 30.9 million to
40.2 million. A lot of that has to do with pension liability increases and other
employee benefits. Also dealing with the economy, shopping opportunities.
The Citizen Survey asked what the quality of shopping opportunities in Palo
Alto is. Seventy-nine of the respondents rated that as excellent or good,
which is up from 70 percent in 2010. Also asking about employment
opportunities, that has also increased. 66 percent of the respondents rated
employment opportunities as excellent or good compared to 52 percent in
2010. Both of those two items are kind of showing how the economy has
rebounded a bit since coming out of the recession. The next slide on the
economy pertains to housing expenses. The median price of a home
increased 19.4 percent since 2010, from about 127,000 to 151,000. Most of
the survey respondents indicated that their housing costs have also
increased. 43 percent said that their costs were 2,500 or more in 2010. In
2015, that increased to 58 percent. What's included in housing costs is rent
or mortgage payments, property taxes, insurance and homeowners' fees. In
addition to that, only 8 percent of respondents rated the availability of
affordable, quality housing as excellent or good. What's not shown in those
housing costs I've separated out below. The average monthly utility bill
increased about 12 percent. If you go back to the previous slideâ€”there's a
slide earlier that says that household income has increased 19 percent. The
people are paying a lot more for housing and utilities. The biggest increase
in utilities was with water. That increased 53 1/2 percent. On your slide, it
says from $43.89; that should be $44.89, to $67.35. Electric utilities have
stayed stable, and gas declined 26, almost 27 percent on the residential
utility bills. Moving on to the education and enrichment facets. The
residents to see opportunities for improvement for education and
enrichment. Although some of these have increased, some of these ratings
can still be higher. The availability of affordable, quality childcare and
preschool ratings increased from 25 percent to 49 percent. Opportunities to
attend cultural arts, music activities, etc., increased from 74 to 79 percent.
Library services ratings increased from 82 percent to 91 percent. A portion
of that would likely be attributable to the reopening of the two libraries in
Palo Alto in the past two years.          Continuing on with education and
enrichment on Slide 16. The total library collection increased 44 percent
indicating that there is that increase in opportunity for education and
enrichment that residents saw in their ratings. However, the number of
check-outs declined 8 percent from 1.6 million to 1.5 million. That does
include electronic check-outs. It may mean that more people are spending
time in the library doing their reading rather than actually checking things
