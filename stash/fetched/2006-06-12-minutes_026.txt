COUNCIL MATTERS

Mayor Kleinberg stated there would be major financial challenges and lost
revenue in the years ahead even with the recent turnaround in the economy
and the increase in sales tax and property tax revenues.

MOTION: Mayor Kleinberg moved, seconded by Beecham, for Council to
take the following actions:

   1. Consider creation of a Mayorâ€™s Ad Hoc Committee on Revenue
      Enhancements to work in partnership with staff.

   2. The Ad Hoc Committee would be directed to develop a set of strategic
      options to creatively meet revenue needs in the short and long term.

   3. The Ad hoc Committee would report its findings and recommendations
      to Council preferably by October but no later than November 2006.

   4. Approval of the creation of Ad Hoc Committee is on the Consent
      Calendar for the next Council meeting.

Council Member Beecham expressed support for the motion.

Council Member Cordell expressed support for the motion. She asked those
persons on the committee would not be affiliated with Stanford.

Mayor Kleinberg said that was correct.

MOTION PASSED 8-0, Mossar absent.
