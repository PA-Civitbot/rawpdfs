funding options and develop a funding plan” after “future ballot measure.”

Council Member Wolbach: Actually we probably would want to change—
would it make more grammatical sense to move "regarding a potential
future ballot measure" to the end of that sentence? Would that make it

Mayor Burt:          I don't care, really.   Let's not get in the middle of the
semantics.

Council Member Wolbach: I just want to make sure it's clear.

Mayor Burt: Council Member Berman.

Council Member Berman: I'm good.

MOTION AS AMENDED RESTATED: Mayor Burt moved, seconded by
Council Member Kniss to form a stakeholder advisory committee, appointed

measure to explore priority transportation needs, identify funding
requirements and explore various funding options and develop a funding
plan; the Committee will be comprised of the following:
