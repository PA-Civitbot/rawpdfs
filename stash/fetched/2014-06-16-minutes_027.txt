He believed the decision belonged with the people because he has seen a
decrease in the number of candidates both for Council and the boards and
commissions. He believed it was based on the demands placed upon those
volunteers.

Council Member Berman opposed the Motion. He has heard a number of
issues with the length of the meetings. The number of Council was not a
matter of how well the community was represented. He believed the voters
should decide.

Council Member Schmid endorsed democracy and therefore he supported
the Motion.

Vice Mayor Kniss noted in the 1990â€™s all 9 Council Members worked full-time
while the current Council there were only 2 who worked. She was not in
support of the Motion because she agreed the voters should have the
opportunity to decide.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION: Mayor Shepherd moved, seconded by Vice Mayor
Kniss to place on the 2014 Ballot the reduction of Council seats to 7
Members, to take effect in 2018.

Mayor Shepherd believed Palo Alto would be well represented with 7-
Members.

Vice Mayor Kniss explained the City Council was considered indirect
democracy because they represented the community. The community voted
for the candidate they felt would represent them fairly with good judgment.
She supported the Substitute Motion so democracy could prevail.

Council Member Holman asked the City Clerk for the estimated cost of
election.

Donna Grider, City Clerk, clarified the cost was $65,000 per Measure to the
Registrar of Voters plus approximately $10,000 for legal notices.

Council Member Holman agreed if the community desired a change to the
democratic setting they should come forward and request it. She did not
believe the Council should take the lead on changing the seating.
