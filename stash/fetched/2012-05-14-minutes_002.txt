Kelly Tsai, Hua Kuang President, was pleased to receive the proclamation for
Hua Kuang's 30 years of service at the Cubberley Community Center. Hua
Kuang was founded in October 1981 by Mr. Ernest Hung and his wife, Grace.
The reading room had 14,000 books, magazines, and journals. Hua Kuang
was a valuable source for scholars. Many books were not found in public
libraries. The reading room provided a gathering place for the Chinese
community, classes, seminars, and social activities. It collaborated with the
Palo Alto Art Commission to create a symbol and Chinese wording for the
new sculptures at the Palo Alto Culture Center and the Main Library.

Council Member Price read the proclamation into the record.

Mayor Yeh congratulated Hua Kuang Chinese Reading Room and thanked it
for providing services to the Palo Alto community.
