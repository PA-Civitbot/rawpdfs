Mayor Burt: I saw Council Member Berman, and I guess Council Member
Schmid was there as well. It was really a great event. It built and
expanded on last year's. We had an honored guest of the Marine Corps
lieutenant colonel—a three-star general who has the largest troop command
in the Marine Corps as our featured speaker and a whole bunch of great
vets. We were a few minutes late because we decided that if a Pearl Harbor
vet or a World War II POW vet or a Marine Corps general wanted a few more
minutes to speak, then they were going to have it. It was really a great
event. The amount that the vets from World War II, Korea, Vietnam and
more recent service—all of them were represented. They were just so
grateful for the appreciation of them that was expressed. It was really
great. This is an event that Council Member Holman and Janice Svendsen
from City Manager's Office had launched last year. I think it's really
important that we continue it. I also wanted to add that we mentioned at
last Council meeting that just over a week ago was the conclusion of the
U.N. film festival, which continues to be a really incredible event that
happens to happen predominantly in our community. After 19 years, most
of our community doesn't know it exists. I'm looking forward to ways in the
future that the City can really be a more full partner in this. It's an
internationally recognized festival. It's really taken for granted here. Those
are my comments. On that note, meeting's adjourned.

Adjournment: The meeting was adjourned at 10:44 P.M.
