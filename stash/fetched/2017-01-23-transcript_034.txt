that goes over the full length of the Bay. This route will eliminate noise and
emissions in our region entirely, applying the Federal definitions and
standards. The City has an excellent opportunity to make sure this gets
done right for three reasons. First, the evaluation of the routes relative to
the proposed alternatives is mandated by law as a first step for any
significant change to flight procedures. Number two, assessing the new
waypoint for 1,000 arrivals will yield procedures far superior to the SERFR
and BSR alternatives as the published report performed by the City's expert
consultants, the Freytag team, demonstrates. The third is that Council has a
dream team of attorneys at hand, Mrs. Molly Stump and Mr. Peter Kirsch,
the City's external aviation attorney. We are at a critical juncture. You have
a critical opportunity, and that opportunity is now. Thank you.

Sea Reddy: Good evening. It's refreshing to see the new City Council, the

the retail industry. Jim Keene would come in there, and he would see how
bubbly I was and enthusiastic I was. Then, I took off on my Land Rover and
made six trips to Panama in my Land Rover. It was an awesome time. One

talk a little bit about that, I think, on Agenda Number 5. Anyway, this is
probably going to be one of my last public presentations here. Palo Alto
Free Press operates here in Palo Alto as a Google virtual office. We also
