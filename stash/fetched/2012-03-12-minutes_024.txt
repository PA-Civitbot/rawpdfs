how that could be adjusted and rationalized better. He concurred with Council
Member Shepherdâ€™s raising of the Eco Pass issue. He did not believe that Eco
Passes were as widely utilized as Caltrain, but believed if residents and
employees could have a choice between an Eco Pass and a Go Pass that was a
better TDM system. He expected most people to choose Caltrain, but stated a
choice would be better.

Council Member Klein said his questions fell into two categories. The first was
the parking issue raised by Vice Mayor Scharff and again by Council Member
Burt. He said he was confused with the talk of the various reductions. He
requested clarification that the Council could throw out all of the reductions in
the requirements if it wanted to since this was a PC application.

Mr. Williams said yes.

Council Member Klein stated that they were starting fresh as to how much
parking should be required on the project.

Mr. Williams said yes and that he had portrayed it in the response as being an
evaluation tool to compare to what typically would be required.

Council Member Klein asked if the assessment district and the one-to-one
exclusion was Code.

Mr. Williams said that was Code but had not been used except for one other
project. It really applied to sites that were vacant or had very little land on it.
He explained the other project was 135 Hamilton, which was the vacant land
at Hamilton and High Street.

Council Member Klein said that would be an exception to the idea that Council
was starting fresh.

Mr. Williams said 135 Hamilton was not a PC.

Council Member Klein clarified he was talking about the Lytton project.

Mr. Williams said yes.

Council Member Klein said if it was Code then it was a matter of law that both
Council and the Applicant had to obey.

Mr. Williams explained that was not true in a PC situation. In a PC situation
Council could create its own zoning standards.
