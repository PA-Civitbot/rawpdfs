Council Member Questions, Comments and Announcements

Mayor Burt: Our final item is Council Member Questions and Comments.

Council Member Kniss: Pat, I hope you're going to say something about
your special week last week. Are you?

Mayor Burt: I will share something.

Council Member Kniss: I was going to say I don't have much to share.

Mayor Burt: Karen, did you have something you wanted ...

Council Member Holman: (inaudible)

Mayor Burt: I'm just looking at the calendar.

Vice Mayor Scharff: Did we finish Council Member Comments?

Mayor Burt: No, go ahead.

Vice Mayor Scharff: On Council Member        Comments, I just wanted to say
that on Wednesday, we have another one       of these airplane noise meetings.
It's a community meeting. Sky Posse will     be presenting. I forget the exact
dates; maybe you'll remember it. It's July   15th ...

James Keene, City Manager: And the 22nd.

Vice Mayor Scharff: ... and 27th ...

Mr. Keene: 22nd.

Vice Mayor Scharff: ... 22nd when the committee will actually deliberate
about what we're looking at. I wanted to call out Council Member Filseth
who's done some really good work in working with Sky Posse. I really
appreciate the analysis and the hard work you've put into that. I actually
have been really impressed with it.

Council Member DuBois: Just to add onto that. I believe Santa Cruz had
500 people show up for their meeting. I would encourage you to attend and
                                                                        Page 95 of 98
