I can't remember as well. Would we then specifically designate that area in
here to include it or not?

Mr. Lait: I guess how we can approach—what we're interested in is the
sentiment from the Council. Where retail exists on this map today, do we
want to protect all those areas or do we want to find ...

Vice Mayor Scharff: We could give general direction ...

Mr. Lait: Yes, please.

Vice Mayor Scharff: ... to you that says if there is currently retail there,
protect it in the Ordinance.

Mr. Lait: Yes.

Vice Mayor Scharff: That's a lot easier to say that. That was that. The
North Face, the Anthropologie and the 100 Addison site, that's currently not
proposed to become retail on this, as far as I can tell. You're not proposing
to protect it?

Ms. Eisberg: Right.

Vice Mayor Scharff: At the end of the Urgency Ordinance, that would just
revert to being able to be used for office?

Mr. Lait: I don't know that we've—we have the other Ordinance that we're

Addison is and the Anthropologie site. I don't see them in yellow. I don't
see that.

Mr. Lait: That's right.
