Mayor Ojakian said the process would not be delayed indefinitely but it was
difficult to determine the date when the model would be completed and the
boards and commissions would complete their review.

Council Member Freeman asked whether it would be reasonable to use Mr.
Benest’s term and “fast track” the SOFA Plan to avoid unnecessary delay.

Mr. Benest replied staff had reviewed how they could go to boards and
commissions simultaneously instead of sequentially in an effort to expedite
the review process.

Council Member Freeman said she wanted the public to understand Council
was not delaying the process.

MOTION PASSED 6-0, Morton “not participating,” Beecham, Mossar absent.
