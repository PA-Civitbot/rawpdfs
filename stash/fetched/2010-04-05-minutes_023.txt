Mayor Burt stated the RWQCP feasibility study was separate from the
composting facility.

Council Member Yeh asked for clarification on which of the four Staff
recommendations would continue:

     1) To Defer Further Action on an Anaerobic Digestion (AD) Facility or
     Aerated Static Pile (ASP) Composting Facility Within Palo Alto, Until
     and Unless a Usable Site is Identified; 2) To Examine the Feasibility of
     Energy Conversion Technologies (Including AD Technologies) During
     the Upcoming Regional Water Quality Control Plant Master Planning
     Process; 3) To Pursue Local Partnering Opportunities with SMaRT®
     Station Partners and/or Local Organic Waste Processing Companies
     that are Developing Private or Energy Conversion Facilities Within a
     20-Mile Radius of Palo Alto; and 4) To Resume Acceptance of
     Commercial Garbage at the Landfill.

Council Member Klein stated recommendation No. 2 would continue.

Mr. Keene stated the only qualification was whether or not recommendation
No. 3 would be completely abandoned since there would be an interim time
period where waste transportation may be necessary.
