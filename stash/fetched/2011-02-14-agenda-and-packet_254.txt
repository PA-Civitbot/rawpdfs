                                                                                                            10.d

 2   Commissioner Tanaka: Okay. I see.

 4   Mr. Rodriguez: You can’t take away a building to add more space on the street so you have to




                                                                                                                   Attachment: Attachment D: P&TC Excerpt Minutes of January 12, 2011 (1320 : California Avenue Neg Dec and CIP)
 5   look at the price on private property in this case, and that would be parking garage.
 6
 7   Commissioner Tanaka: So if you have 17 more spots. Let’s say 17 times $50,000 that is…?
 8
 9   Mr. Rodriguez: That is about $850,000.
10
11   Commissioner Tanaka: So by getting 17 more spots we are basically adding about $800,000 to
12   $900,000 to this project.
13
14   Mr. Rodriguez: That is right. Actually, one of the things I did want to mention, I am sorry to cut
15   you off, Commissioner Tanaka, is that we are undergoing a separate, completely parallel parking
16   analysis of both the California Avenue business districts as well as the Downtown University
17   Avenue Parking Districts. We are going to look at exactly what we did on California Avenue for
18   every street within those districts. We are going to look at first how can we reconfigure every
19   parking street, every loading zone, every red curb zone to try and maximize parking within those
20   districts. So we can maximize available on street parking before we look at trying to build more
21   parking structures off street at a more costly rate. So that is something that we are going to be
22   kicking off probably in February right when I come back from paternity leave. Curtis is actively
23   helping hire a Parking Manager in my absence.
24
25   Commissioner Tanaka: Okay, so basically if I do the math in my head for $500,000 the City gets
26   $1.8 million of improvements, plus $800,000 worth of parking spaces. So $1.8 plus $800,000 is
27   $2.6 million. So for half a million dollars we get $2.6 million injected into California Avenue.

29   Tommy, just to ask you real quick, does that seem like that would help? I understand the land
30   use issues, but does that seem to help in your opinion as an informed business owner on
31   University and experienced Economic Development Manager? How would that impact the area
32   for the businesses?
33
34   Mr. Fehrenbach: Certainly adding parking is a big help. Sense of place making tends to attract
35   folks, or attract folks that are already coming to the area to stay longer and hopefully spend more
36   money. So certainly.
37
38   Commissioner Tanaka: That is all for the questions for you, Tommy. Actually I have a few
39   other questions but I am running out of time. Can I ask the Chair to indulge me to run through
40   the rest of these?
41
42   Mr. Rodriguez: Commissioner Tanaka, I just want to add on to some of Tommy’s comments.
43   Tommy and I have had a lot of discussions about what can we do to make sure that economic
44   development occurs within California Avenue with this project. We have bounced around ideas
45   in between the two of us. One of the things we thought about is as we are beginning construction
46   of this project and we are nearing this end we want to make sure people know that we made
