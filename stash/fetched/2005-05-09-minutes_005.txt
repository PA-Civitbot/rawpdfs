CONSENT CALENDAR

Council Member Kishimoto registered a no vote on Item No. 2

Council Member Freeman asked where the $2 million was in the budget
for purchase of rollout single stream waste containers.

Public Works Deputy Director Michael Jackson said it was in the 2004-
2005 Refuse Fund Operating Budget.

Council Member Freeman verified it was under supplies and materials.
For the 2003-04 fiscal year budget it was $163,000, and increased to
$2,300,000 in 2004-05 fiscal year budget. She questioned the $2 million
increase within a two-year timeframe.

Joy Ogawa, raised concerns regarding Palo Alto Sanitation Company
(PASCO) issuing large yard trimming and recycling containers to the
residents. She expressed the large containers occupied too much space
and over-exceeded some of the resident’s needs.     Distribution of the
large containers where they were not needed was a waste of City funds.
The pilot Single Stream Recycling Program might work for most single-
family homes but not for multi-unit apartments.

Council Member Freeman said Council had placed $2 million into the
Refuse Fund and increased the Refuse Fees. She registered a no vote on
Item No. 2.
