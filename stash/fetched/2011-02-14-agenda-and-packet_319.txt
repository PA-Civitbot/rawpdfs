                                                                                                          a

            10. Not participating. A Council Member who disqualifies him or herself
            pursuant to the Political Reform Act of 1974 because of any financial
            interest shall disclose the nature of the conflict and may not participate in the
            discussion or the vote. A Council Member may otherwise disqualify him or
            herself due to personal bias or the appearance of impropriety.

            11. Tie votes. Tie votes may be reconsidered during the time permitted by
            these rules on motion by any member of the Council voting aye or nay
            during the original vote. Before a motion is made on the next item on the
            agenda, any member of the Council may make a motion to continue the
            matter to another date. Any continuance hereunder shall suspend the
            running of any time in which action of the City Council is required by law.
            Nothing herein shall be construed to prevent any Council Member from
            agendizing a matter that resulted in a tie vote for a subsequent meeting.




                                                                                                              Attachment: 2.15.11 (1422 : Policy and Services Agenda 2/15/2011)
            12. Motion to reconsider. A motion to reconsider any action taken by the
            Council may be made only during the meeting or adjourned meeting thereof
            when the action was taken. A motion to reconsider requires a second, is
            debatable and is not amendable. The motion must be made by one of the
            prevailing side, but may be seconded by any Council Member. A motion to
            reconsider may be made at any time and shall have precedence over all other
            motions, or while a Council Member has the floor, providing that no vested
            rights are impaired. The purpose of reconsideration is to bring back the
            matter for review. If a motion to reconsider fails, it may not itself be
            reconsidered. Reconsideration may not be moved more than once on the
            same motion. Nothing herein shall be construed to prevent any Council
            Member from making a motion to rescind such action at a subsequent
            meeting of the Council.

           13. Appeal from the decision of presiding officer. When the rules are silent,
           the presiding officer shall decide all questions of order, subject to appeal by a
           Council Member. When in doubt, the presiding officer may submit the
           question to the Council, in which case a majority vote shall prevail. Any
           decision or ruling of the presiding officer may be appealed by request of any
           member. The presiding officer shall call for a roll call or electronic voting
           device vote to determine if the presiding officer's ruling shall be upheld. If
           said vote passes or results in a tie vote, the presiding officer's ruling shall
           stand. If said vote fails, the decision or ruling of the presiding officer is
           reversed.

           14. Getting the floor; improper references to be avoided. Every Council
           Member desiring to speak shall address the chair and, upon recognition by
           the presiding officer, every Council Member shall be confined to the
           question under debate, avoiding all indecorous language and personal
           attacks.
