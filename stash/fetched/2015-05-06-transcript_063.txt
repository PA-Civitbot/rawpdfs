                          TRANSCRIPT
don't want to send paper to all these entities either. Right now, I guess the
public could be broadly interpreted. "Digitally to the public" as opposed to
"publicly available." I don't know if that makes any difference. "Publicly
available" means everybody can access it. "Digitally to the public" sounds
like we're talking about people out there as opposed to internally. I'm
suggesting to the maker of the motion that instead of "available digitally to
the public," "be made publicly available."

Council Member Scharff: "Publicly available digitally." That's fine.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER:             Direct Staff to return with an Ordinance
updating Municipal Code Section C to read "As soon as possible after each
Council meeting, verbatim minutes would be made publicly available digitally
and hard copies available upon request."
