Council Member Kishimoto said there was a condition to set up a gateway to
the neighborhood.

Mr. Emslie said they would provide the conditions to the Council at places
that evening.

Council Member Kishimoto asked for confirmation that the daylight plane
and height limit were met for a project adjacent to a RM-15.

Mr. Emslie said the daylight plane would not apply as antennas were
exempt.

Council Member Kishimoto said the Council needed to adopt a policy and
required more than an informational report.

Assistant City Manager Emily Harrison said the Zoning Ordinance Update
would manage the land use portions of a telecommunications policy and the
informational report would inform the Council regarding issues.

Council Member Kishimoto said she wanted to have a policy in place prior to
the next application.

Ms. Harrison said staff’s workload did not allow time for a policy.

Council Member Kishimoto asked whether staff would look at examples such
as San Jose’s policy.

Ms. Harrison said a comprehensive telecommunications policy would not be
forthcoming because of staff reductions and other priorities.

Council Member Kishimoto asked about the timeline on the site and land use
portion.

Mr. Emslie said the details were being worked on.

Council Member Kishimoto said a policy was needed prior to receiving
additional projects.

Ms. Harrison said staff agreed. There was a commitment to include a policy
into the Zoning Ordinance Update.

Council Member Morton had concerns with the landscaping maintenance.

Mr. Emslie said the City could review the permit for compliance.
