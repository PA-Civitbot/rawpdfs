Mr. Williams had raised concerns about removing an item from a signed
Easement Agreement which needed to be presented to Summerhill Homes
and could require renegotiations.

AMENDMENT RESTATED: Council Member Kishimoto moved, seconded by
Council Member Klein that it is the policy of the Council that the easement
not be used for emergency access unless Staff returns to Council with an
emergency access plan for emergency vehicles only.

Mr. Baum stated for point of clarification he asked Council Member Klein if
the emergency access plan was to return with the Site and Design Review.

Council Member Klein said yes.

Council Member Barton asked whether the panhandle currently allowed
emergency access.

Mr. Williams said he was not aware of anything that prohibited access.

Council Member Barton raised concerns because fire trucks required access
within 150 feet from all parts of a building. If the City takes away the right
to bring a fire truck in the back end, it could restrict their ability to redevelop
the site. He urged the Council to vote no on the Amendment.

Council Member Schmid said there was an economic value in keeping the
emergency access opened. An option would be to have an easement for the
entire panhandle and there would be a larger park useful to children in the
future. He asked the maker of the Motion if that was acceptable to add as a
negotiating point.

Council Member Klein asked Council Member Schmid to clarify his suggested
Amendment.

Council Member Schmid said the City was giving up 26,000 square feet of
Floor Area Ratio (FAR) for half of the panhandle and suggested offering the
security access in order to obtain the entire panhandle.

Council Member Klein did not accept the suggested Amendment.

Vice Mayor Morton said due to safety reasons he was not in favor of taking
away the emergency access. He urged the Council not to support the
Amendment.
