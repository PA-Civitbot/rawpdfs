Council Member Shepherd stated she supported placing the initiative on the
ballot in an effort to move forward with other City business.

Council Member Yeh stated he supported moving the initiative to the ballot
as a Council responsibility. He did not support the intention of the Charter
Amendment; he felt it was inappropriate to lock-in staffing levels within the
City Charter.

Council Member Price stated she was disappointed the City and the
Firefighters Union could not reach a mutual agreement which led to this
initiative. She felt the initiative would only place further strain on the Cityâ€™s
resources and community energy. She stated she did not support the
initiative.

Council Member Klein stated placing the initiative on the 2010 ballot would
be more cost effective for the City.

Mayor Burt clarified approximately six years ago the previous City Auditor
recommended an independent study be conducted on the appropriate
standards of coverage for the Fire Department. As a result of the study the
Firefighters Union had attempted to circumvent the process by locking-in the
current level of staffing within the City Charter.
