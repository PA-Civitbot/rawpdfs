                                                                                                                  10.d

                                                                                                                         Attachment: Attachment D: P&TC Excerpt Minutes of January 12, 2011 (1320 : California Avenue Neg Dec and CIP)
 5   Chair Tuma: Thank you.
 6
 7   Mr. Williams: Chair? I just wanted to add to that. I certainly agree with what Mr. Fehrenbach
 8   said. I think we do have to be and will take a lot of time during the design process, be cognizant
 9   of the construction period impacts on businesses. This is a major project and clearly there is a
10   potential for having disruption there that will affect the businesses. So I think it will behoove us
11   to spend much time in terms of trying to find ways to minimize those impacts whether it is the
12   way we phase things or being sure that entrances are kept clear, and that kind of thing. We will
13   pay attention to that.
14
15   Chair Tuma: Thank you. Commissioner Fineberg followed by Martinez.
16
17   Commissioner Fineberg: One quick housekeeping matter. This photo was given to us at our
18   places. Who gave it to us? Why do we have it? What does it mean to us?
19
20   Chair Tuma: I will take that. It is a prop. It is a photo that I took and I will explain it later.
21
22   Commissioner Fineberg: Okay, never mind. Let me start with my higher level issues.
23   Following up on Commissioner Garber and Chair Tuma’s question of our analysis of a Negative
24   Declaration while there is also an area plan and a Comprehensive Plan Update going on, I would
25   like to ask that question by saying is this a segmented review? If not, why not?
26
27   Mr. Williams: We don’t think it is. This is something that the City has been working on for
28   some time now in terms of looking at California Avenue and the streetscape and that before we
29   were doing the concept plan. We believe that also it does essentially stand on its own. It would
30   be very speculative to wait until the other plans are done. Again, we have looked at the issue of
31   is this perhaps constraining the concept plan in particular in terms of future development
32   intensity on the road. We think that it is a project that will help stimulate the area whether it is
33   part of that longer effort, or if that doesn’t come to fruition in the short term, immediate term, as
34   well. So it does stand on its own very well. It has been underway for sometime now, and we
35   don’t think that it has to necessarily be tied to the other projects.
36
37   Commissioner Fineberg: Okay. I appreciate your answer but I remain unsure how to evaluate
38   the Negative Declaration in view of our next item tonight, without going into detail, is talking
39   about two months from now – not even two months – in February of 2011 we are going to have a
40   Vision Statement of what happens in our priority development areas. It has these charts with
41   potential areas, California Avenue being one of them, with densities literally hundreds of units an
42   acre. So if we are concurrently visioning an area a block away with what I consider incredible
43   densities, and our instructions in that exercise are to suspend reality and just plan as a vision, and
44   then three months later you introduce reality and constraints. I don’t understand how we can do
45   that and create environmental documents on both. So I remain troubled by that.
