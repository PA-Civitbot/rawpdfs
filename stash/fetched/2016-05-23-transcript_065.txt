Council Member DuBois: Was it the ARB findings?

Mayor Burt: Yes.

Council Member Holman: Could I speak to that before the maker? Is that
okay?

Mayor Burt: Pardon me?

Council Member Holman: Could I speak to that before the maker, if that's
okay?

Mayor Burt: Go ahead.

Council Member Holman: I'm looking to Staff because, when I introduced
Finding Number 1, I asked about what's on Packet Page 64. It says promote
orderly and harmonious development in the City. That's the first bullet. I
was told that that was Finding Number 1. Did I misunderstand?

Mr. Lait: I'm sorry, Council Member Holman. I believe that I may have
been incorrect. The first finding is the design is consistent and compatible
with applicable elements of the Comprehensive Plan. That's Finding Number
1.

Council Member Holman: What then is promote orderly and harmonious
development in the City? What does that refer to? What finding?

Mayor Burt: I'm sorry. I was referring to site and design review findings.
I'm mistaken. It's confusing.

Council Member Holman: I've been focused on ARB findings. I'm okay with
taking out the site and design review findings. I have another suggestion.
If Staff can tell me, promote orderly and harmonious development in the
City, what finding is that?

Mr. Lait: That's related to Finding 16.

Council Member Holman: Sixteen?

Mr. Lait: Yeah. Those bullet points are in relation to Finding 16.

Council Member Holman: It really should be then ... Bear with me. It really
should be "2"â€”we'll delete "4," if that is more consistent. It should be "2,"
"5," "6" and "16." Is that correct?

Council Member DuBois: What about ARB Finding 1?
