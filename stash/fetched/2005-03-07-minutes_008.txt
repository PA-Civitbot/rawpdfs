MOTION PASSED 6-0 for Item No. 4, Beecham not participating, Freeman,
Ojakian absent.

MOTION PASSED 6-1 for Item No. 13, Beecham no, Freeman, Ojakian
absent.

Council Member Kishimoto said she had seconded the motion but would
have asked that Item No. 6 be removed if she had known so many people
were going to speak on the item.

Council Member Morton echoed Council Member Kishimoto’s concern.

Council Member Beecham clarified that he did not participate on Item No. 4
rather than voting “no.” He would not support Item No. 13 because he felt
it was not Council’s role to be involved with issues at the Federal level.

Council Member Morton clarified once the Children’s Library closed, a
number of people and services needed to be redistributed temporarily, which
would impact the Downtown and College Terrace Libraries. If the move
became permanent, it would need to return to Council for approval. The
intent was not to deprive the Downtown Library of services.

Council Member Kishimoto said the Director of Libraries reaffirmed the
Downtown Library would remain open and a viable resource for the
neighborhood. She confirmed technical services would be at the Downtown
Library until a long-term master plan was developed.

Council Member Mossar reaffirmed the changes reflected in the CIP resulting
from Children’s Library closure were temporary. In regard to Item No. 13,
initially she did not vote to refer the item to the Policy and Services
Committee (P&S) as explained by Council Member Beecham. After being
heard by the HRC and P&S Committee, she gave it her approval and felt it
was time to move on.
