Willie Thoits, Palo Alto, said the storm drains needed to be corrected in his
area.

Mayor Burch announced that written protests had to be submitted or
withdrawn prior to the close of the Public Hearing. Protests could not be
accepted once the meeting was closed.

Electra van Bragt, 2580 Waverley Street, asked Council to look into other
means to pay for the storm drains. She said she was on a fixed income and
could not afford the monthly increase from $4.25 to $10.00.

Mayor Burch declared the Public Hearing closed at 10:34 p.m. and asked the
City Clerk for the number of written protests.

City Clerk Donna Rogers said there were 242 written protests received.

Mayor Burch asked whether the number of the written protests was greater
than 50 percent of the properties.

Ms. Rogers said it was not.
