Ms. Furth said the matter would be continued to July 12, 2004.

Council Member Morton asked whether substantial corrections to the
violations be weighed in the adjudication of the issue.

Council Member Kleinberg said she would like the City Attorney to explain
the steps that needed to be taken.

MOTION PASSED 9-0.

RECESS: 10:00 p.m. to 10:09 p.m.

10A. (Old Item No. 5) Policy and Services Committee recommends to the
     City Council Adoption of a new policy regarding “At Will” employees.”

Council Member Kishimoto asked staff for recommendations about a
minimum tenure for a department head to receive severance.

Mr. Benest said severance was important in the first year.          Department
heads needed to be given some level of protection.

Council Member Kishimoto asked why it was important for Palo Alto to offer
a severance package.

Mr. Benest said most cities had “at will” employees. The City would need a
civilized manner with which to terminate employment of “at will” employees.

Council Member Kishimoto said if the City were going toward a performance-
based model, she would most likely support it.

Council Member Freeman questioned          why   the   City   did    not   have
performance-based employment.

Mr. Benest said the City did have performance-based employment.

Council Member Freeman said it was not standard practice for corporations
to offer severance to employees for an amount of time longer than they had
been employed.

Herb Borock, P.O. Box 632, said he opposed the recommendation because
the City of Palo Alto was not a private industry.
