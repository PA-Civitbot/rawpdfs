Arthur Keller, 3881 Corina Way, said community members should be
surveyed to find out who would consider hooking up FTTH for $1,200.

Hilda Weisberg, 1051 Channing Avenue, said she was actively working in the
community to determine if individuals would be supportive of investing
$1,200 for FTTH.

Utilities Advisory Commissioner George Bechtel said proposals of financing

FTTH trial.

Mr. Bechtel said that had not been discussed.

a collaborative and proactive approach to addressing legislative regulatory

possible new strategies and recommendations.

Council Member Kishimoto said long-term financing would be difficult to

were many other priorities that needed to be focused on.
