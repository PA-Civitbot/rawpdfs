Council Member Morton stated the process outlined was a 15-week process
and asked if that was enough time.

Mr. Oldani stated that the City Management field had the greatest grapevine
in the world and he had already started to receive phone calls from people
inquiring about the job.

Council Member Morton asked if he was concerned at all about the selection
process being a month.

Mr. Oldani stated once the Council was clear with what direction they were
going, it generally took about five to six weeks.

Council Member Morton asked how the process was managed when there
were nine Council Members and many other people who wanted to be
involved in this process.

Mr. Oldani stated that 65 percent of the people who made it to the final
round of interviews would come from people who were directly recruited on
the Councilâ€™s behalf.

Council Member Kishimoto asked Mr. Oldani to describe the challenges he
foresees with this recruitment.

Mr. Oldani stated the challenges would come in different forms like the
compensation package and the housing cost issue.

Council Member Schmid stated Mr. Oldani had experience in the Bay Area
and a nationwide basis and he asked what unique attributes his firm would
bring.

Mr. Oldani stated they had helped around 35 University oriented
communities from around the nation to find City Managers and they had
been very successful. The average individual that their firm placed stayed in
their position around eight to nine years and according to the International
City/County Management Association (ICMA) for a community this size
someone stayed in their position about four and a half years.

Mayor Klein asked how he felt about public interviews with two to three
finalists.

Mr. Oldani stated he preferred not to but they had conducted a large number
of open interviews and rules were set so answers were not inhibited.
