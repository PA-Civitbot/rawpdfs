Mr. Ross reported construction costs of $520 per square foot for a 44,848
square foot building totaled $23 million; a parking garage of 72,000 square
feet at $100 per square foot totaled $7.2 million; and site work of 73,000
square feet at $40 per square foot totaled $2.9 million. Hard costs totaled
$33.45 million. Design costs and soft costs were 15 percent or $5 million;
contingencies were 15 percent or $5 million; equipment and technology,
including furniture, fixtures, and equipment, totaled $3 million. The grand
total was $47.494 million.

Council Member Klein asked if that was a turnkey cost.

Mr. Ross responded yes except for the cost of the land. There was a large
amount of contingencies, which the City did not have to spend.          A
reasonable budget would include those contingencies.

Vice Mayor Scharff asked whether Certificates of Participation could be based
on a stream of rental income.

Mr. Perez answered yes.

Vice Mayor Scharff wanted Staff to prepare an analysis of costs to improve
the space and possible revenue from rental of the space. He inquired
whether the Police Department had a preference for Option 1 or Option 2,
assuming the City located it on California Avenue.

Mr. Sartor stated Option 1 and 2 were comparable. Parking enforcement
was not a major change. The major difference was between Option 1 and
Option 3.

Vice Mayor Scharff recalled Chief Burns' comment that offsite evidence and
property storage was inefficient.

Mr. Burns would prefer onsite storage, if possible.

Vice Mayor Scharff did not believe offsite storage would provide much
savings over time. Not all space cost the same to build. He wondered about
the amount of savings in decreasing the size of the community room.

Mr. Perez reported the City could have revenue of approximately $1.2
million, assuming the Police area was approximately 21,000 square feet and
a $5 per square foot rental rate. That would provide approximately $14-$15
million in debt issuance at a 4 1/2-5 percent rate.

Council Member Burt inquired about the current use of the print shop and
