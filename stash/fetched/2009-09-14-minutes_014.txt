Council Member Burt asked whether there was a 150 feet setback
requirement for emergency access to a development.

Mr. Williams clarified the Fire Department required that they be able to get a
hose to reach 150 feet from any point of the development.

Council Member Burt asked Staff to clarify whether the elimination of the
emergency vehicle access to the panhandle would not restrict the ability to
build at the rear of the property.

Mr. Williams said he did not anticipate that; the intent would be if there was
a hazardous situation that prevented access from El Camino Real that there
be a secondary access that would allow emergency vehicles to get through.
