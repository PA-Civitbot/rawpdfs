Second, the Staff Report mention of a Cost of Living Adjustment (COLA) was
not contained in the contract. The use of COLA was misleading.

Stephanie Munoz urged the Council not to reduce health benefits for
employees.

MOTION: Vice Mayor Kniss moved, seconded by Council Member Klein to
adopt the Resolution approving a new Memorandum of Agreement (MOA)
between the City of Palo Alto and Service Employeesâ€™ International Union
(SEIU), Local 521 effective December 1, 2013 through December 1, 2015
and concomitantly amending Section 1401 of the Merit System Rules and
Regulations.

Council Member Klein reiterated that the contract did not contain a COLA,
but a salary increase. The two-year contract would affect the Budget over
two years.    The contract was good for the City and employees.        He
appreciated the opinion/editorial column by Council Members Burt and
Berman.

Mayor Shepherd indicated the opinion/editorial column was excellent.

MOTION PASSED: 8-0 Price absent
