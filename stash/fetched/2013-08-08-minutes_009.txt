Under the PC Zone, the Council reduced the number of units from 9 to 7.
With the Council's changes, housing on Maybell Avenue had a lower impact
and a better design than existing zoning would provide.       The Project
provided fewer impacts and less density than existing zoning.

Council Member Klein concurred that PC Zoning protected the neighborhood
better than existing zoning. He recommended residents read the Frequently
Asked Questions provided by the Planning Department Staff and located on
the City's website. Setting the election in November 2013 provided a time
value for the community.

Mayor Scharff stated the neighbors supported 60 units of senior housing but
preferred 8 units of market-rate housing. The Project would improve the
quality of life in the neighborhood more than existing zoning. Unless
someone was willing to pay for the property, it would not be an orchard.
Existing zoning would reduce the quality of life for the neighborhood. Some
neighbors formed a non-profit corporation and filed a CEQA lawsuit. He
suggested they dismiss the lawsuit and let the residents of Palo Alto decide
on the Project. He reiterated that the Project was less impactful than
existing zoning, and citizens should support the Project.
