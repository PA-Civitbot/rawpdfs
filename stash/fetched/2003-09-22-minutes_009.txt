Council Member Lytle disclosed she had gone out to the field and
looked at the site and plans.

MOTION: Council Member Morton moved, seconded by Ojakian, to
accept the Director of Planning and Community Environmentâ€™s
recommendation (CMR:447:03) to approve the request for relief from
Ordinance Number 4784 to allow review of a nine-unit townhouse
project at 872-876 San Antonio Road by the Architectural Review
Board (ARB) and action on the project by the Director, based on the
staff report before council.

Planning Manager Lisa Grote, requested an exemption from the
Charleston Corridor development moratorium for a nine-unit
condominium project.

Council Member Lytle said the transportation area was a potential
candidate for one of the new land-use designations. This area was to
be maintained as a diverse business and light industrial district.

Ms. Furth said the discussion was about taking that parcel out of
moratorium. Only the transportation issues would be addressed.

Council Member Lytle asked what would prevent the entire area from
being converted to a use inconsistent with the Comprehensive Plan
(Comp Plan).

Ms. Grote said staff did not believe the Comprehensive Plan policy had
been violated.

Council Member Lytle asked how the area would be considered in its
isolation. It would initiate a different land use pattern in that area.

Director of Planning and Environment Steve Emslie, said the zoning
permitted residential. There was not a discretionary review of a
residential project in that area.

Council Member Lytle said if the area was protected under the Comp
Plan, the moratorium should be expanded.

Mayor Mossar said the Comp Plan could and would include housing.

Council Member Lytle said it was an outdated Zoning Ordinance that
said it could and would include housing. It was one of the ten areas
identified for change in the Zoning Ordinance.
