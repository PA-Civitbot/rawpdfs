orientation and mass transit actually worked. She favored something that
did not prohibit housing; however, she did not want more office buildings.

Council Member Mossar noted an example in a commercial zone of housing
over commercial on El Camino Real. In that instance, the concern had been
the housing was almost immediately converted to office. She encouraged
her colleagues to be precise in the language or there would be a repeat of
the same type of project.

Mayor Kleinberg asked whether there was any way to control the commercial
use so that it was retail serving.

Mr. Emslie said yes. It was an accepted convention for cities to zone
commercial and retail uses separate from office use.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to amend the motion to state “retail” and not
“commercial.”

Council Member Klein asked whether the incorporation would cause any
delays.

Mr. Emslie said no.

MOTION PASSED 7-2, Barton, Drekmeier absent.

MOTION: Council Member Klein moved, seconded by Cordell, to ask staff to
initiate the rezoning process for the last four of the six properties on
Attachment C.

Council Member Klein said it was important to keep the City’s commercial
enterprises in place by making the zoning consistent with its current uses.
Whether the Anderson Initiative passed in November or not, it would be
important to move forward and get it done.

Council Member Cordell said irregardless of whether the Anderson Initiative
passed, by taking a use already in existence and having it remain that way
had merit. The Anderson Initiative would probably go through legal
challenges for a number of years even after the election.

Council Member Mossar said the zoning suggested the motion could turn
Fry’s into an office park. She clarified that none of the four parcels was in
the City’s Housing Element.

Mr. Emslie said that was correct.
