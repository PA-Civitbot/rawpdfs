12.   The Finance Committee recommends to the City Council to Adopt
      the Transportation Strategic Plan, Including System Performance
      Indicators, Project Prioritization, and Cost Funding Report (Item
      continued from 10/04/04)

Mayor Beecham said no dollar cost would be assigned to the
implementation of the Strategic Plan and all Council Members could
participate since there were no conflicts of interest.

MOTION: Council Member Mossar moved, seconded by Morton, to
approve the Finance Committee recommendation to adopt the proposed
Transportation      Strategic Plan,   including  Transportation System
Performance Indicators, as noted in Attachment A, and Project
Prioritization, Attachment B, and Cost Funding Report.

Council Member Mossar said the Plan would enable the City to
competitively apply for grants. It was not an action plan or approval to
implement projects.

Council Member Morton said the Plan provided performance indicators
that allowed the City to apply for grants.

Council Member Freeman asked whether the Homer/Channing Avenues
two-way project was always a low priority in the Project Priority List.

Chief Transportation Officer Joseph Kott said it was always a low priority.

Council Member Freeman asked why it remained as a low priority in light
of the Homer Tunnel project.
