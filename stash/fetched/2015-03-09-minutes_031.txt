Vice Mayor Schmid recalled a couple of large exceptions in Sales Tax
revenues over the past few years. He asked if that distorted the projection
for Sales Tax revenues.

Mr. Saccio indicated recessions were a factor. The compound annual growth
rate included both recessions. Stanford revenues would be factored into the
future. Staff adjusted for one-time Sales Tax increases.

Vice Mayor Schmid asked if the LRFF attempted to account for one-time
effects.

Mr. Saccio replied yes.
