Mr. Sartor said the educational component would not be affected. A meter
would be displayed outside the Baylands Interpretive Center to run
backwards to indicate how power was being generated instead of being
used.     The plan was to proceed with the design and anticipate the
installation at Cubberley, Baylands Interpretive Center and the carports.
DOE granted an extension on completing the program through June 30,
2007, and there would be time to look at trackers.

Council Member Beecham said there were comments regarding the high cost
of the project. He clarified the project was experimental and the purpose of
the DOE grant was for monies dedicated for unusual projects for the general
publicâ€™s benefit. The electricity would be generated during the peak hours in
the summer when energy cost would be at the highest and he wanted the
public to know the project cost was not out of line.
