considered exclusively or in project aggregate. He asked for specifics on how
this would be approached.

Mr. Williams suggested no one-way to approach it and agreed to its
multiplicity. He cited, however, that one different aspect of the basement
space was the DEE for an additional 5,000 feet of additional floor area, and
that was not what staff saw it as.

Council Member Yeh noted the canopy in the visual which seemed to limit
the perception of height at ten feet versus a maximum of a fifteen-foot floor
and asked what the functional purpose was of the canopy.

Mr. Williams stated it was most appropriate to ask that of the Project
Architect.

Council Member Burt stated in his experience, rooftop equipment would not
require 5,600 square feet of space solely for that purpose. He questioned
why this was a full basement rather than a fractional one.

Mr. Williams did not know the structural reason but stated there were some
other things such as areas for garbage in the basement.

Council Member Burt asked if retail storage under other code requirements
would be permissible in a basement like the one in the plan.

Mr. Williams stated it would be permissible if the height was less than seven
feet, but not if it is over that, and then it would count as floor area.

Council Member Burt stated it was his understanding that by code
restrictions this area could be used for equipment only.

Mr. Williams stated no, it was just if it was deemed not useable, it generally
was not habitable.

Council Member Burt asked then, if under general code restrictions it would
be useful for any other office functions or retail offices.

Mr. Williams stated a retail office would be allowed and it would be counted
as floor area.

Council Member Burt asked if there were other code restrictions preventing it
from being used for other functions.

Mr. Williams stated no, there was not.
