Mayor Klein stated his concern was with the switch over from CPI to AMI for
the people who own right now and want to sell right now.

Mr. Emslie stated that Staff understood the Council’s direction.

Vice Mayor Drekmeier asked if AMI was a countywide figure.

Mr. Emslie stated yes.

Vice Mayor Drekmeier asked if that was just Santa Clara County.

Mr. Emslie stated yes.

Council Member Morton stated that the first part of the policy would state
that we were directing Staff to revise the appreciation formula to AMI going
forward with the final wording to be presented to the Council.

MOTION PASSED: 8-0, Burt absent

MOTION: Council Member Morton moved, seconded by Council Member
Barton to improve the condition of the existing older BMR housing stock by
creating a deferred payment renovation loan program for very low-income
BMR owners.

Council Member Morton stated that there were new owners in the BMR
program facing major assessments with no easy way to fund. We would be
enabling them to participate in a housing contract, and the costs would be
deferred and taken into consideration on the sale of the unit.

MOTION PASSED: 8-0, Burt absent

MOTION: Council Member Morton moved, seconded by Council Member
Barton to lower the threshold for the BMR requirement to 3 new units or 3
single family lots from the current 5.

Mr. Emslie stated that any current application would use the existing
threshold and any new application for development that came in after the
Council’s action would be subject to the lower threshold for three units
rather than the current five.

Mayor Klein asked how that would affect a three-unit Developer.

Mr. Emslie stated they would be subject to an in-lieu fee calculated based on
a percentage of the sales price.
