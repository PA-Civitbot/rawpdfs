Mayor Burt: Thanks. Council Members Holman and Wolbach already had
your lights on. Do you want to continue?

Council Member Holman: Yes. You said 15. I counted 14 unless I missed
somebody. The fourth one you listed was a property owner. I don't know
what that means.

Mayor Burt: You're right; I counted 14. What was the second question?

Council Member Holman: The fourth one you listed, I just caught property
owner. I don't know what that means.

Mayor Burt: I'm sorry. Commercial property owner.

Council Member Holman: From anywhere in town?

Mayor Burt: Yeah, that was the general concept.

Council Member Kniss: I'm still getting 15.

Mayor Burt: I had 14 without PTC.

Council Member Holman: I got 14.

Mayor Burt:    If we add PTC, it becomes 15.        Or we could have four
residents.

Council Member Holman: You said PTC would be ex officio, I thought.

Mayor Burt: Did I get this right? Let's see. It's 14 unless we count the PTC.

Council Member Kniss: Still get 15.

Mayor Burt: Council Member Wolbach.

Council Member Holman: I wasn't done.

Mayor Burt: I'm sorry.

Council Member Holman: A small business owner outside of Downtown.
Why not small business owner Downtown? There's only one small business
owner and one medium business owner.

Mayor Burt: We'd have a Downtown TMA representative, which could either
be a small or a large business owner.

Council Member Holman: It's likely not going to be small.
