Mayor Kishimoto agreed the tour of Space Systems Loral was fascinating.

Council Member Barton noted the oil slick in the Bay had made its way south
to Redwood City; he questioned what contingency plans had been made if
the oil reached the Palo Alto Baylands.

Mayor Kishimoto adjourned the meeting in memory of Helen Norman Proctor
who passed away on November 7, 2007. Helen devoted her professional
time as a landscape architect to projects in the Palo Alto Baylands. She
compiled a City of Palo Alto Baylands Master Plan plant list, created a
landscape for many of the City of Palo Alto parks and facilities, and
originated the concept of community parks.

ADJOURNMENT: The meeting was adjourned at 9:26 p.m. in memory of
Helen Norman Proctor.
