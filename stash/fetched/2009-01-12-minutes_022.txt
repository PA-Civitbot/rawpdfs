MOTION: Council Member Kishimoto moved, seconded by Council Member
Klein to approve Staff recommendation to adopt the Resolution ordering the
abatement of weed nuisance in the City of Palo Alto.

Council Member Espinosa acknowledged and thanked the Santa Clara County
officer and Manager of the Weed Abatement program for his meeting
attendance.

MOTION PASSED: 9-0

15.   Approval of the Acceptance of Citizens Options for Public Safety
      (COPS) Funds in the Amount of $101,039 for the Police Chiefâ€™s
      Request to Purchase Automated License Plate Reader Equipment,
      Sound Meters, Digital Cameras, Alcohol Screening Devices, Upgraded
      Flashlights and Protection Batons, and Police Trading Cards.

Interim Police Chief, Dennis Burns gave an overview of the above-noted
requests and the reasoning behind each item in the improvement of public
safety and enforcement of Municipal Codes.

City Manager, James Keene added the request was made against a State
grant which flowed through the County. The State legislation required a
public hearing on these approvals.

Council Member Barton asked for more information on the automated license
plate reading equipment. He desired information and awareness from a Civil
Liberties standpoint. He asked if this was pointed reading of a car in
question or reading and recording of every car that was passed by the
officer. In the latter case, he was not in support of the purchase of this
equipment.

Mr. Burns stated it involved the latter application of reading a number of
cars at once.

Vice Mayor Morton asked if there would be database retention of this
information beyond the day it was recorded.

Mr. Burns stated, as applied to parking enforcement, a market was in
development with the license plate reader company. The database aspect
was yet to be worked out with regard to time lengths for data retention.
