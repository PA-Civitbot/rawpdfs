Vice Mayor Scharff: It would be a separate process. The Eichler—yeah,
probably for the Eichler. I want options. It could be for the Eichler overlay
or not. I don't know how to make that decision tonight. I think the more
options we have when it comes to us the better.

Council Member DuBois: Yeah.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to add to the Motion, “direct Staff to return to
Council with options regarding the petition and voting process.” (New Part C)

Council Member DuBois: I would say, two seconds to Mr. Berman. When
they signed the petition, it was very clear (crosstalk).

Mayor Burt: Council Member DuBois.

Council Member DuBois: Again, getting to the petition and voting process ...

Mayor Burt: I'm sorry, I'm not going to allow (crosstalk).

Council Member DuBois: I would accept the amendment.

Mayor Burt: You have something to accept, you say?

Council Member DuBois:     I said I would accept the amendment as written
here.

Mayor Burt: Thank you.

Mr. Keene: That's "C"?

Mayor Burt: Council Member Holman.

Molly Stump, City Attorney: Mr. Mayor, may I just clarify what's intended by
"B"? Is the maker and the seconder intending that the Council adopt an
ordinance tonight establishing a one-year time-limited single story overlay?
Then, "C" is a direction to return with future policy options ...

Mr. Keene: That's the way I read it.

Ms. Stump:    ...considering the Citywide ordinance. That's how Staff reads
it.

Mayor Burt: I believe that's the intent of the Motion. Is that correct?

Council Member DuBois: Yes.
