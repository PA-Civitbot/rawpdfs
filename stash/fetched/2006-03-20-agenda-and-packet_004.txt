DATE:          MARCH 20, 2006                                         CMR: 183:06

SUBJECT:       APPROVAL OF AGREEMENT AND DECLARATION OF COVENANT
               TO PROVIDE PARKING AT 130 LYTTON AVENUE BETWEEN THE
               KENSON GROUP AND THE CITY OF PALO ALTO

RECOMMENDATION
Staff recommends that Council approve and authorize the City Manager to execute the attached
Agreement and Declaration of Covenant to Provide Parking at 130 Lytton Avenue between the
Kenson Group and the City of Palo Alto.

BACKGROUND
In November 2004, the Kenson Group, owners of the property at 130 Lytton, contacted the City
to address a potential future loss of leased parking at the site. The development at 130 Lytton is
part of the 2001/2002 Downtown Parking Assessment District, with building area of 47,234
square feet and a parking obligation of 189 spaces. 118 parking spaces are provided by 130
Lytton, leaving an obligation of 71 spaces under the 2001/2002 Assessment District bond.
Seventy of the 118 spaces associated with130 Lytton are located in a two-story parking structure
located on an adjacent parcel that is leased by the Kenson Group under a parking lease that
expires in September 2014. While it is not anticipated that the leased parking spaces will be
converted to any other use, the Parking Covenant is intended to resolve any uncertainty.

DISCUSSION
130 Lytton is the only property subject to the 2001/2002 Assessment District bond that has a
portion of its credited parking spaces located on leased property owned by another property
owner for which the lease may terminate during the assessment period. There is one other
property with leased parking, but the obligation to provide parking extends beyond the term of
the assessment. Three other properties provide parking offsite, however the subject properties
and the parking location are under the same ownership. In addition, there are six other properties
identified in the Assessment Roll as providing parking on a separate legal parcel. These six
properties all include buildings that cover multiple parcels and parking that is fully integrated
into the site, such that the parking locations could not be independently developed.
