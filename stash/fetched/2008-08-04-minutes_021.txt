considerations, the compensation to the company and actual rate impacts to
the Enterprise Fund. He state there were other costs covered by the Fund so
the rate payers was less than the incremental increase in compensation to
the company. The PASCO contract represented approximately one-third of
the total Enterprise Fund.

Council Member Schmid asked where the rest of the money come from.

Mr. Deibler stated the actual rate impact to the rate payers ranged between
seven and eleven percent.

Council Member Schmid asked how the income went up by nineteen to thirty
percent if the rate impact was between seven and eleven percent.

Mr. Deibler stated it was the difference in compensation that the contractor
was actually being paid.

Council Member Schmid asked if funds were being transferred from
elsewhere to make up the compensation.

Mr. Roberts stated the Refuse Fund revenues came from the rate payers,
recycling operations, and the landfill tolls. The Refuse Fund expenditure
totals were 32 million dollars annually with the compensation being 12
million dollars. The rates were set based upon the 30 million dollars with the
hauler being paid on a one-third scale.

Council Member Schmid clarified for each dollar of revenue, an increasing
share went to the hauler rather than the City.

Mr. Roberts stated all of the revenues came to the City with the fund paying
out to other activities.

Council Member Schmid asked what compensation the City received from
the increase in the new contract.

Mr. Roberts stated the zero-waste services were included in the new
contract.



Mr. Deibler stated the baseline services mirrored each other with changes to
the policy, land use, landfill future, and the corporate yard move to another
city which explained the delta between the 10.2 million dollars and the 11.9
million dollars.
