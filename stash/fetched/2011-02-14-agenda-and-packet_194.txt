Existing Transit Service

Existing transit service in the study area is provided by Caltrain, the Santa Clara Valley
Transportation Agency (VTA), and the Stanford Marguerite shuttle. The California Avenue
Caltrain station is located at the terminus of California Avenue, which provides access to




                                                                                                      Attachment: Attachment B: Hexagon - Cal Av TIA Report (No Appendices) (1320 : California Avenue Neg Dec and CIP)
the park-and-ride lot. There are two bus lines that operate on California Avenue: VTA
Route 89, which provides access from the Caltrain station to the Stanford industrial park,
and Marguerite Shuttle Route C, which provides access from Caltrain to the Stanford
University campus. In addition, there are seven VTA bus lines that operate on El Camino
Real and stop near California Avenue.

Existing Intersection Levels of Service
Intersection level of service calculations show that the study intersections all operate at
LOS C or better during peak hours (see Table 4). These levels of service are indicative of
acceptable operations with little congestion. The STOP controlled intersections all operate
at LOS A or B. The signalized intersection of California Avenue and El Camino Real
operates at LOS C.
