INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND THE SECONDER to change the “minimum of 20 ft setback on
Maybell” to “20 ft average setback with a minimum of 18 ft,” subject to site
and design review by Architectural Review Board.

James Keene, City Manager, reported Staff was agreeable to the language
change.

Mayor Scharff inquired whether the Motion should state minimum and
maximum setbacks.

Mr. Aknin recommended the Motion state a minimum setback of 18 feet and
an average setback of 20 feet.

Council Member Burt supported Mr. Aknin's recommendation. He asked if
both the PTC and Architectural Review Board (ARB) reviewed setbacks for
projects.

Mr. Aknin noted the PC process was presented to the PTC. The project could
be subject to ARB Director approval with appeal to the Council.

Council Member Burt was agreeable to following the standard PC review
process.

Council Member Kniss inquired whether the proposed language for setbacks
changed the outcome of the design.

Mr. Aknin recommended the language be included in the Motion to provide
variation in the setbacks.

Council Member Kniss recalled the changes in the language regarding
setbacks, but would accept the proposed change if it was a further
improvement.

Council Member Price felt the proposed language was returning to the
original setback of 17 feet.

Council Member Burt explained that the setbacks would average 20 feet.

Council Member Price wanted setbacks of 20 feet and more.
