           Gateway Property for Open Space Preservation

________________________________________________________


At the direction of Mayor Liz Kniss in February 2000, we have been working
with City staff and members of the Friends of Palo Alto Parks to identify
sources, and secure funding, for the acquisition of the Peninsula Open Space
Trust (POST) Arastradero Gateway property (formerly owned by Jacqueline
Bressler) at the guaranteed purchase price of $3,560,000 by October 2005.

To date, Palo Alto has received commitments for several grants, as follows:

      California State Per Capita Grant Program              $266,000
      California State Roberti-Z’Berg-Harris Block Grant     $163,825
      California State Land and Water Conservation Fund      $162,385
      California Coastal Conservancy                       $1,000,000
      Santa Clara County Park Charter Fund                 $1,000,000

We also approached the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation for a conservation
grant of $1,500,000. In October, we met with the Foundation’s San Francisco
Bay Project Manager, Frank Jordan, and discussed the merits of the acquisition

contributions to the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, East Bay Regional
Parks, Sonoma Land Trust, Peninsula Open Space Trust and Solano County to
acquire hundreds of acres of open space land, the Foundation is not able to
consider our request at this time. Mr. Jordan suggested the City of Palo Alto
