Vice Mayor Beecham said the referendum, as written, was to support
the ordinance. If the referendum failed, the zoning at 800 High Street
reverted to the underlying zoning.

Council Member Freeman said she was unclear as how the PC parcels
were included.

Ms. Furth responded that all the existing PCs remained; there was no
proposal to modify any of the six existing PC districts in the area.

Council Member Freeman clarified the Council was talking about the
RT-50.

Vice Mayor Beecham said that was correct.

MOTION PASSED 7-0, Morton, Mossar “not participating.”

Council Member Burch asked whether there was anything else the
Council did to date that prevented Council Member Lytle from voting
for the ordinance if it came back reflecting the Council’s suggestions.

Council Member Lytle said no.

MOTION: Council Member Ojakian moved, seconded by Kishimoto, to
accept the staff recommendation for Item 5. Residential Density and
Average Unit Size Limits.

Council Member Freeman clarified no maximum density limit applied in
both RT-35 and RT-50.

Mr. Emslie said the density spoke to the number of units; when
density caps worked in combination of FARs, if the density cap was too
low, larger units were promoted. The cap restricted the number of
units that could fit inside a building envelope. Staff recommended no
cap, because it promoted more attainable housing.

Council Member Freeman asked whether there was a cap.

Mr. Emslie said the FAR defined the building envelope, and the density
spoke to the number of units that fit inside the envelope.

MOTION PASSED 7-0, Morton, Mossar “not participating.”
