        In addition to the reading of ordinance titles, we have received questions about the
necessity of reading the full title of all closed session matters prior to adjourning to closed
session. Although not uncommon, the practice of reading the full title of closed session matters
is not required by law. Under the Brown Act, agencies are required to make a public
announcement prior to going into closed session. However, in most cases the announcement
may legally be made by reference to the agenda item (e.g. an announcement that states, “The
Council will be going into closed session as described in agenda item 1”). While there are
exceptions to this rule for certain litigation matters, those exceptions could be identified by the
City Attorney prior to the closed session and additional announcements would be made only as
necessary.

       We have advised City staff that the reading of full titles for closed sessions is not
required, and have already implemented that change. No further Council action is necessary.
