could quickly tell us. I think your intention is that you want to make sure we
get ground-floor retail. There are exceptions, and you want to do away with
those exceptions.

Council Member DuBois: Yeah.

Council Member Scharff: I'm fully supportive of that. If that's it, I'm going
to second it.

Council Member DuBois: I have it in front of me. Five is if you create new
or remodeled ground-floor area, there's an exception if the new ground-floor
area is larger than the past. Six is an exception if you're part of a
coordinated plan that allows non-retail uses on the ground floor. I'd broaden
this. If we're going to make it a separate Motion, that Staff update
18.16.050. Look at the whole section of exceptions.

Mayor Holman:      That's much broader than what our noticed item is
probably.

Council Member DuBois: Or 050(a) which is the exception.

Council Member Wolbach: The point you're ...

Mayor Holman: I'm looking to City Attorney.

Ms. Silver: We did mention this particular Ordinance in the Staff Report, so
there's some leeway there.

Mayor Holman: The Ordinance as a whole?

Ms. Silver: Yes, 18.16.050.

Council Member Scharff: I will second that for you.

AMENDMENT:       Council Member DuBois moved, seconded by Council
Member Scharff to add “as a separate consideration, update Municipal Code
Section 18.16.050.”

Mayor Holman: Council Member Wolbach, did you have a clarifying question
on that?

Council Member Wolbach: I wanted to clarify that this isn't a separate
Motion. This is an Amendment which I did not accept; therefore, it has to go
through a discussion.

Mayor Holman: We've got that.
