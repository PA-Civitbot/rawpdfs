Council Member Questions, Comments and Announcements

Mayor Holman: Are there any? Council Member Berman.

Council Member Berman: I just want to quickly mention the Palo Alto kids
carnival that I went to on Saturday afternoon after our Boards and
Commissions recognition event. This is somethingâ€”there's an article on it in
the Palo Alto Weekly or at least Palo Alto Online as of today. Hopefully it'll
make it to the print edition. This kind of came out of the initial meeting that
Reverend Coloma Smith of Palo Alto's University AME Zion Church had after
the Charleston shootings. A lot of community members were there and
expressed a real desire to have more interaction with people of other faiths,
other ethnicities, other backgrounds, other walks of life. Pastor Smith
organized this kids carnival which was geared towards children. He's also
been organizing book clubs and kind of movie watch nights and these kind of
things. It was really awesome. The City of Palo Alto was a co-sponsor of
the event. I connected Pastor Smith with first Rob de Geus and then also
with Khash Alaee who both helped the pastor with the permitting processes
