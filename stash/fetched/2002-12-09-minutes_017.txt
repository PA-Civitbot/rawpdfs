Vice Mayor Mossar asked staff if it was their intention to rezone one or both
of the parcels to LM(D)(3).

Mr. Emslie said the rezoning would encompass the former Scott's Restaurant
building, which was the area designated for PC.

Vice Mayor Mossar clarified the second parcel was already zoned LM(D)(3).

Mr. Emslie said that was correct.

Vice Mayor Mossar asked for a summary of the allowable uses in LM(D)(3).

Mr. Emslie said LM(D)(3) zoning allowed for childcare, all forms of residential
housing, and restaurants, which did require a use permit.

Vice Mayor Mossar said whether LM(D)(3) zoning allowed for an auto
dealership.

Mr. Emslie said an auto dealership would fall under Retail Services, which
are conditionally permitted under LM(D)(3) zoning.
