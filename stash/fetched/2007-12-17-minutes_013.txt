Mr. Roberts stated that this contract would use the existing composting
operation until after the landfill closed and the State has approved the
closure, we would guarantee the haulers the use of current composing
operations through 2011. After that would depend on the policy direction
given from the Council about the future of composting.

Council Member Drekmeier asked whether we were composting all of our
green waste.

Manager of Solid Waste Public Works Russell Reiserer stated out of 21
thousands tons there was three hundred tons used for Alternative Daily
Cover (ADC) at the landfill.

Council Member Drekmeier asked whether there was opportunity to compost
food waste.

Mr. Roberts stated that would require separate permits at a much higher
standard.

Council Member Morton asked for: less weighting for the first category, to
combine financial strength under qualifications and have it no more than 25
percent, and to raise the cost to 40 percent.

Mr. Roberts stated this was a subsequent step in the process and was based
100 percent on cost and the cost ranges on the Scope of Services. The
Council would have an opportunity to give direction based on cost.

Council Member Morton asked whether the evaluation criteria would be
public record.

Mr. Roberts stated that was correct.

Council Member Morton asked whether there would be a basic definition of
what the baseline services were.

Mr. Roberts stated there was an attempt to show that in Attachment A.

Council Member Morton stated he did not know if that defined what we were
expecting or what we currently do.

Mr. Roberts stated these were what we were expecting to add under Zero
Waste.

Council Member Morton expressed his concerns with protecting current
PASCO employees.
