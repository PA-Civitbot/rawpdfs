represent the actual cost of handling materials at the SMaRT Station with
long-range planning considered.

David Moss, 347 Ferne Avenue, spoke in support of keeping composting at
its current location within the City. He stated he was also pro-life, pro-
parks, but stressed the importance of composting as well.

composting and completing Byxbee Park.

composted chips in the park area with the possibility of residents bringing
trees to be chipped on the minimum. She stressed the need to address the
health dangers in composting.

Bob Wenzlau, 1409 Dana Avenue, spoke on the scheduling issues for closing
the landfill. He stated generation of organic material could be a shared use
while parklands are being prepared. He stressed the actual tonnage and

strategies.

delay the landfill closure, keep composting out of the park, and to look
careful at composting elsewhere.

between Council and Staff. He stated questions lacked clarity and answers
did not truly inform.

was for parkland.
