MOTION PASSED 9-0.

CONTINUED DISCUSSION OF FORMER ITEM 13A

Ms. Harrison said the item would return to the Council on the March 15,
2004 Council agenda.

MOTION: Council Member Morton moved, seconded by Mossar, for staff to
bring back the item to Council on March 15, 2004 with an analysis of legal
issues and consideration of a mechanism to implement refunds should
Council choose to do so.

Mr. Mayfield said staff would return with an analysis of legal issues involved
and practical implementation of the process.

Ms. Harrison stated staff would make a strong effort to return on March 15,
2004, if not, it could not return until late April.

Council Member Morton clarified it was Council’s intent to find a way to make
the refund possible.

Council Member Cordell asked staff to return with specific answers to the
questions: 1) could the Council legally make a refund to Mr. Bradley and
how would the refund process be accomplished; 2) what was required legally
with other refunds owed to those similarly situated to Mr. Bradley; and 3)
how many refunds could be applicable and what would be the total amount
of refunds.

Council Member Freeman clarified Mr. Bradley got caught between the
Finance Committee making a recommendation and the time the
recommendation was brought to Council.

Council Member Mossar clarified that she and Council Member Kleinberg
were focused on properties caught up in the fee reduction scheme only, and
not the fee increase scheme.

Council Member Morton added it was more specific to Mr. Bradley’s situation
and any one similarly situated.

Council Member Mossar clarified individuals with fee increases were not
relevant to the motion.

Council Member Kleinberg requested when staff returned to the Council, to

03/01/04                                                                   17
