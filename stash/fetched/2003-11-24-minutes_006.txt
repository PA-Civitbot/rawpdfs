Vice Mayor Bern Beecham said Council Member-Elect LaDoris Cordell was
eligible to take her seat. Code 1090 did not have an agency or commission
that would be responsible for its implementation or administration.

Council Member Lytle said LaDoris Cordell was appropriately elected. It was
believed Ms. Cordell was exempt from the provision due to Stanford’s non-
profit status.

Council Member Ojakian asked what Stanford agreements and dollar
amounts would be at risk.

City Manager Frank Benest said there were millions of dollars at risk.

Council Member Ojakian asked if a list of agreements with Stanford had
been produced to keep the public informed.

Mr. Benest said a list could be identified.

Council Member Ojakian said it would be beneficial to define why the issue
was being approached in the manner it was. Possibly the dates of the
contract renewals should be shown. He asked what would happen if the
legislature did not change the legislation.

Mr. Benest said there was difficulty with the ongoing contracts that might
come up for renewal or amendment.          They could not be renewed or
amended except on a case-by-case basis. Separate legal analysis would
need to be made.

Ms. Furth said the City’s first step would be to look for alternate parties with
whom to contract.

Council Member Ojakian said the City would be in jeopardy of losing
contracts with Stanford.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to add to ask the City Attorney to get a definitive
binding ruling with the Stanford University Attorney on the previous years
served by LaDoris Cordell.

Council Member Freeman asked for a list of relevant Stanford contracts that
would be at risk within the next three months.

Mr. Benest said no Stanford contracts would be at risk in the first quarter of
2004.
