Council Member Morton asked whether the City’s administration costs for the
program had increased to 20 percent.

Mr. Mullen said that was true for the current year.

Vice Mayor Kishimoto asked whether there was a process to review and
consider any changes.

Assistant City Manager Emily Harrison said staff was not ready to respond
because they had just heard about the recommendations that evening. She
asked whether the recommendations were from the full CAC rather than the
chair.

Mr. Mullen said yes.

Vice Mayor Kishimoto said the trends should be reviewed.

Mayor Kleinberg asked why grants were made to groups outside of the City.

Ms. Caporgno said the groups outside the City indicated how they served
Palo Alto residents.

Mayor Kleinberg stated for the record, the group was serving the City’s
population.

Mr. Mullen said the Alano Group had confidentiality issues with respect to the
substance abuse clients it served.

Council Member Morton expressed a concern of the percentage of
administrative costs. He requested staff to report back to justify or reduce
the administrative costs.

Mayor Kleinberg concurred with Council Member Morton’s comment.
