                     ACTION MINUTES
A.   Cumulative Cap:

     Policy L-1.10 would maintain a Cumulative Cap of 1.7 million square
     feet, which is the square footage remaining under the existing cap,
     focus the Cap on Office/R&D uses and apply it citywide rather than
     only in “monitored areas.” It would also exempt medical office uses in
     the Stanford University Medical Center (SUMC) area (the current cap
     does not apply to this geographic area), and require annual monitoring
     to assess the effectiveness of development requirements and
     determine whether the cap and the development requirements should
     be adjusted; and

B.   Annual Limit:

     Direct Staff to return with a permanent Ordinance addressing the
     Annual Limit, separate from the Comprehensive Plan Update; and

C.   Downtown Cap:

     Eliminate the Downtown cap found in existing Program L-8 and focus
     on monitoring development and parking demand.

AMENDMENT:      Council Member Filseth moved, seconded by Council
Member DuBois to replace Part C of the Motion with, “retain the existing
Downtown Cap for 45,000 square feet and exempt retail from the Cap.”

AMENDMENT RESTATED: Council Member Filseth moved, seconded by
Council Member DuBois to replace Part C of the Motion with, “Program
L-1.16.4 would retain a Downtown Cap of about 45,000 square feet for
Office/R&D similar to Program L-1.16.2, and would also Cap new hotel
development at 50,000 square feet.”
