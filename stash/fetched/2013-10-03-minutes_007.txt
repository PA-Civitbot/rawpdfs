Council Member Klein wanted the information to be at a high level. Under
Item Number 3, Staff could provide alternative or additional
recommendations. The intent was to have a focused, high-level report to
allow the Council to focus on particular items.

Council Member Holman explained that Staff would need to know what the
Council was thinking in order to address those issues in their report.

Mayor Scharff noted an RPP was included in the tentative Agenda for
November 9, 2013.

Council Member Holman inquired whether the RPP encompassed the larger
area or University North and South.

Mayor Scharff understood the discussion would pertain to the larger area.

Council Member Holman reported Certificates of Occupancy was another
method for consideration. The City did not utilize Certificates of Occupancy
as a trigger to address changed conditions. She agreed with the public
suggestion to engage transit authorities in the discussion. She asked why
referral to the Planning and Transportation Commission (PTC) was not
included in the Motion.

Mayor Scharff stated that after the Council reviewed information at the end
of 90 days, the topic could be referred to the PTC.

Council Member Holman requested Staff consider technology at parking lots,
Certificates of Occupancy, engaging transit authorities, shared parking lots
and shared permits.
