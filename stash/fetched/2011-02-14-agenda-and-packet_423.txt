       EPA’s recognition that sewage sludge management, including incineration, is an inherent part of POTW

operations for which federal funding was made available is also reflected in the primary regulatory program for
sewage sludge management, the Part 503 program.8 This was developed under the authority of CWA § 405 and
RCRA. For example, EPA has stated that:

                 Sewage sludge has been an important concern of the Agency since 1972, when
                 EPA, through the Federal Water Pollution Control Act construction grants
                 program, began assisting in the financing of wastewater treatment facilities.

58 Fed. Reg. 9248, 9260 (February 19, 1993).

                 Treatment works treating domestic sewage, as noted above, include facilities
                 dedicated to the disposal of sewage sludge (i.e., surface disposal sites and
                 incinerators).

Id. at 9359; see also 40 CFR § 122.2, in which “treatment works” is expressly defined to include sewage sludge
treatment systems.

       The legislative history of CAA § 112 also indicates that Congress intended the air emissions from POTW
operations covered by CAA § 112 to include air emissions from SSIs. For example, Congress indicated that

                 [t]he Administrator is specifically directed to include publicly owned treatment
                 works (as defined in the Clean Water Act) and [certain RCRA facilities] among
                 the categories of major sources pursuant to this subsection . . . . The Agency has
                 also indicated that air emission standards for POTWs may be promulgated under
                 the Clean Water Act. There is no standard of protection of either human health
                 or the environment from releases to air under that Act. It is more likely that
                 appropriate standards would survive a legal test, if established pursuant to these
                 new authorities of § 112 of the Clean Air Act.9

        The CWA-derived air emission standards that Congress intended to supplement with CAA § 112 include
those that control emissions on SSIs. Thus, Congress was well aware that air emissions from SSIs were already
regulated by the CWA § 405 requirements and chose § 112 as the means to update these requirements as
warranted by the applicable protection requirements. In addition, POTWs and SSIs are both included on a
Congressional list of source categories intended to be regulated under CAA § 112.10 By contrast, as NACWA has
