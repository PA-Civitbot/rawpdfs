raising almost $1 million for the project. In March 2004, the agreement was
put in place and the partnership was finalized. In June 2004, project design
began, and ARG was hired to do the design work. In August 2005, the
Council adopted a resolution that designated the Children’s Library as a
sender site for the transfer development rights process. On January 10,
2006, bids were received, which came in approximately 10 percent higher
than the engineer’s estimate that was prepared the prior October. Design
costs over the three year’s of the project design had risen largely due to the
addition of a south wing to the project as well as going through a National
Environmental Protection Act (NEPA) clearance for Housing and Urban
Development (HUD) funds. The construction was originally anticipated to be
approximately $2.2 million, and the actual bids came in at $2.6 million.
Increased costs were attributed to the rise in material construction costs,
steel and concrete, and inflation over time. The sources of funding included
the Palo Alto Library Foundation ($660,000), Friends of the Palo Alto Library
($473,000), HUD grants ($360,000), the Arriaga Family ($50,000), Utilities
Department ($10,000 through the CARE program), the transfer of
development rights high bid would bring in approximately $240,000, and
approximately $2 million would come from the Infrastructure Reserve. The
estimated shortfall was $650,000. Staff proposed to defer two infrastructure
projects in the next year to reduce the impact on the Infrastructure Reserve.
The projects included the upgrade of the restrooms at Cubberley Community
Center and reroofing of the Foothills Park Interpretive Center. Two relevant
deadlines were associated with the Council’s action: the TDR bids were
extended for the third time, and the construction bids were valid for 60
days. Bids were opened January 10, 2006, and expired on March 11, 2006.

Council Member Morton said the high bid was $240,000 for the TDRs and he
asked about the impact of the transfer.

Manager Real Property Bill Fellman said staff did not know what building the
TDRs were transferred to. TDRs could be sold and held and resold at a later
date.

Council Member Morton asked what staff envisioned could be done with the
$240,000 received from the purchase of TDRs.

Director of Planning and Community Environment Steve Emslie said there
were a number of factors. In order to be used, the TDRs had to go through
the Architectural Review Board. The TDRs would not allow an owner to
exceed the one to one Floor Area Ratio (FAR), which was the limit in the
Downtown area and would provide relief from parking requirements.
Specifics were subject to the design review of the Architectural Review Board
(ARB).
