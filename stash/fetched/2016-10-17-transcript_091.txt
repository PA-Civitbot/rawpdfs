Vice Mayor Scharff: That's correct.

Council Member DuBois: Yeah.

Council Member Holman: Then we would need the CUP.

Mayor Burt: That actually says under this, if you wanted to be more
restrictive than the Motion, you would have to add that. As of right now, it's
a permitted use under this Motion.

Council Member Holman: The amendment would be to require a CUP for
private schools in the RT-35 District.

Vice Mayor Scharff: No.

Council Member Holman: Are you not seconding that? I know you've had
issues with this for years.

Mayor Burt: I have concerns though that we're being over-restrictive on
some of these outlier uses that are not in our retail core and SOFA.

AMENDMENT:         Council Member Holman moved, seconded by Council
Member XX to add to the Motion, “require a Conditional Use Permit (CUP) for
private schools in the RT-35 District.”

AMENDMENT FAILED DUE TO THE LACK OF A SECOND

Council Member Holman:       That's a health and safety one from my
perspective. Staff, you wanted some direction on window coverage. Are
you confident with what you have already included?

Mr. Lait: Yeah. If we're past the floor heights for SOFA II, what we're going
to be looking at is the films and working with the Attorney's Office to find
how much leverage we have to address the existing nonconforming uses and
requiring some modifications to those window storefronts. We'll come up
with some standard about 70 percent clear visual access, that kind of thing.

Council Member Holman: If I could add to that one thing which is reflective
glass.

Mr. Lait: No reflective glass.

Council Member Holman: Reflective glass, add to that. That doesn't need to
be in the Motion. Sale of goods ...
