Council Member Kniss: Saying after this actually comes to fruition, then that
percentage will be calculated. Correct?

Mr. Lait: Yes.

Council Member Kniss: That's what I needed to know. Those will go into
affordable housing, but someplace else in the City.

Mr. Lait: It would go into an affordable housing fund.

Council Member Kniss: Thank you.

Mayor Burt: Council Member DuBois:

Council Member DuBois: I'm sorry if I missed it. I didn't see the votes by
the Architectural Review Board (ARB) and the PTC. Did they—how did they
approve the project? What was the results of those meetings?

Mr. Ah Sing: Because it's just a subdivision, it only needed to go to the
Planning Commission.

Council Member DuBois: Was it unanimously approved?

Mr. Ah Sing: Yes, it was. Of the members that were present, yes.

Council Member DuBois: Do subdivision maps always come to Council?

Mr. Ah Sing: Yes.

Council Member DuBois:       That's why we're seeing it, because it's a
subdivision? Thank you.

Mayor Burt: I just have a few questions. One is on Clemo. The house on
the corner of Clemo and Maybell—I can't tell—it doesn't appear that
there's—I should have looked at the other drawing. No curb cut on Clemo
there, is that correct?

Mr. Ah Sing: That's correct. There's a shared driveway on Maybell with the
adjacent lot for that.
