MOTION PASSED 9-0.

Acting City Attorney Bill Mayfield noted the Council packet contained a report
from the Santa Clara County Grand Jury recommending the City begin the
collection lien process of fees that pertain to two residential properties
owned by a single individual. The matter was agendized for April 12, 2004,
for the Council consideration of the lien that would be placed on the property
for collection. The legally required notices for the lien process were going
out to the property owner. There would be a response to the Grand Jury
after the item was heard and completed.

Mr. Mayfield reported at the prior weekâ€™s closed session that staff was
authorized to conduct negotiations on the civil litigation claim of Albert
Hopkins. Mediation was conducted in San Francisco before the Judicial
Arbitration and Mediation Services by Judge Rebecca Westerfield, which
resulted in a successful negotiated settlement of all claims by Mr. Hopkins
against the City and its officers in the amount of $250,000. The Police Chief
was in the process of investigating and making decisions on the
administrative proceedings that might be taken regarding the two officers,
and there were also criminal proceedings pending by the District Attorney
against the two officers.

Mayor Beecham asked given those ongoing actions, was it appropriate for
the City to make a statement on what might have happened that evening.

Mr. Mayfield said given the circumstance, it was inappropriate for Council to
take a position or make a statement in regard to the matter.

AT THIS POINT IN THE PROCEEDINGS, THE CITY COUNCIL
ADJOURNED TO A SPECIAL MEETING AT 9:55 P.M. AS THE BOARD OF
DIRECTORS  OF   THE   PALO   ALTO    PUBLIC    IMPROVEMENT
CORPORATION AND RECONVENED AS CITY COUNCIL AT 10:00 P.M.

COUNCIL COMMENTS, QUESTIONS, AND ANNOUNCEMENTS

Council Member Mossar suggested when items were fundamentally
ceremonial they should be placed on the agenda under Special Orders of the
Day and not on the Consent Calendar. The staff presentation during the
Consent Calendar was an interruption and the item should have been
removed.
