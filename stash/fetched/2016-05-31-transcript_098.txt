Council Member Holman: Do what?

Council Member Filseth: He suggested a couple of things that were actually
downgrades. We said we wouldn't (crosstalk).

Council Member Holman:      We're looking at downgrades at a next phase?
They're just not up here.

Mayor Burt: It does now question whether our—now that we have four
items, do we want to give Staff guidance on what we would reduce in
priority to make room for these four?

Council Member Wolbach: Also, do we want to have any more discussion
about the others or are we saying we're done with all of those for the
evening?

Mayor Burt: We're done.

Mr. Keene: How can you do that quickly? You might suggest some things
that wouldn't work anyway. They're not fungible.

Mayor Burt: That's right. How about we offer suggestions and see if—the
things that we would reduce would be suggestions as opposed to
determinative. One, Staff has to look at kind of the ramifications. Second,
there's a budgetary layer to this.

Mr. Keene: Could I make a suggestion? Assuming the City Attorney would
let you do this, why don't you guys go home and put some things in some
rank order that you would put—and individually send them to us. Then, we
have the benefit of knowing what they were as we make our
recommendations. Then, they have to come back to the Council. I'm just
trying to ...

Council Member Kniss: Of these items here?

Mr. Keene: What you're saying is ...

Mayor Burt: What we'd deemphasize to make room for this.

Mr. Keene: What would you deemphasize in the remaining list. You put five
things in your rank—it's the only way to mine a whole bunch of info really
quickly.

Council Member DuBois: Just for PCE items.

Mr. Keene: PCE items. Can we do that?
