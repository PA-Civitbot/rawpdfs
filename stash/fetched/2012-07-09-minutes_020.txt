Mr. Williams indicated Staff would clarify the information.

Council Member Klein felt the last sentence in that paragraph stated the
obvious.

Mr. Williams advised Staff would revisit that sentence.

Council Member Klein asked for the status of the vacant property between
Palo Alto Square and McDonald's.

Mr. Williams asked if it was the triangular parcel that fronted on El Camino
Real

Council Member Klein answered yes.

Mr. Williams stated Staff had included a parcel there zoned RM-15. Staff
would confirm they were the same parcels and, if not, review the parcel.

Mayor Yeh suggested a potential Motion including proposed edits should be
written.

Vice Mayor Scharff reported the RHMC discussed the need to submit the
Housing Element in a timely manner in order to receive certification. The
RHMC discussed submitting the Housing Element without raising issues and
without revising the entire document. In preparing the Housing Element for
the following cycle, Staff and the RHMC would review the document in
depth. He agreed with Council Member Klein's sentiments regarding ABAG's
process, but expressed concern that including such language would create
delays in certifying the Housing Element.

Ms. Silver stated Staff could insert language that would preserve the
argument without raising issues.

Vice Mayor Scharff assumed a Motion would not need to propose specific
language but simply direct Staff to include language to that effect.
