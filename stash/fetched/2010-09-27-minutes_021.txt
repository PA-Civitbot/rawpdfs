state as initiatives worked to carve out the overall budget.     He did not
support the Motion.

Council Member Scharff echoed Vice Mayor Espinosa and Council Member
Yeh’s comments. He did not support the Motion.

Council Member Holman said there was a nexus. She said impacts on state
parks not only came from the people but from the vehicles that go there.

Council Member Shepherd said she felt it was an issue that did not affect the
Palo Alto Council Members and best left to the voters. She did not support
the Motion.

Council Member Price felt it was a good way to get resources for state parks
and wildlife. She supported the Motion.

MOTION PASSED: 5-4 Espinosa, Scharff, Shepherd, Yeh no

MOTION: Council Member Scharff moved, seconded by Mayor Burt to
oppose Proposition 27- Eliminate State Commission on Redistricting.

Council Member Scharff said the Commission on Redistricting would lead to
less gerrymandering and move more to the center for California. It would
end the gridlock in Sacramento and create more bipartisanship.

Mayor Burt said Proposition 20 seemed to move congressional redistricting
to a similar commission. He said he would not support Proposition 20 either
because it could put California at a disadvantage. He concurred with Council
Member Scharff’s comments and felt it was a good move already passed by
the voters.

Vice Mayor Espinosa said there were several Federal and State redistricting
models and did not know which one was best for California or Palo Alto. He
asked to refer both issues to the Policy & Services Committee.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION: Council Member Shepherd moved, seconded by
Council Member Yeh to forward Proposition 27- Eliminate State Commission
on Redistricting, to the Policy & Services Committee for discussion.

Council Member Shepherd said she needed more background on the
redistricting.
