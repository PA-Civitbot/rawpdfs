Member Klein left the meeting at 9:20 P.M.

Mayor Shepherd asked Council to identify any information they learned that
was outside the public record.

Council Member Berman met with representatives from Stanford University
and did not learn anything outside the public record; he invited the appellant
to meet but they declined.

Council Member Price discussed this project with representatives from
Stanford University and was not aware of any additional information that
was not in the public record.

Mayor Shepherd disclosed that she met with Stanford University on the
maps portion of this project but did not learn anything beyond the public
record. This project related to a housing development project that was the
subject of a 2005 Development Agreement between the City of Palo Alto and
Stanford University. To make sure all Items were before the Council, Staff
combined the public hearing on the Architectural Review Board (ARB)
appeal, the Directorâ€™s Appeal, and the subdivision map.

answer questions.
