                                                                                                               10.d




 1   a grant definitely, we would end up with another CIP that was for the construction of that
 2   project.

 4   Commissioner Fineberg: Okay, let me rattle through my quick questions.




                                                                                                                      Attachment: Attachment D: P&TC Excerpt Minutes of January 12, 2011 (1320 : California Avenue Neg Dec and CIP)

 6   Chair Tuma: We need to give everybody a fair opportunity to have their time. We are again,
 7   based on some of the things that we talked about this weekend at our Retreat, we are trying to
 8   keep things on track.
 9
10   Commissioner Fineberg: Okay, pass.
11
12   Chair Tuma: Thanks. Commissioner Martinez followed by Tanaka.
13
14   Commissioner Martinez: As one of the advocates of trying to be quick I think I am going to take
15   more time than I am allocated. I want to talk about the urban design aspects of the project
16   because I think it is kind of manifold and I share some of Commissioner Fineberg’s concern
17   about other things that we are not talking about tonight. Also use it to sort of give my little
18   primer on urban design.
19
20   Urban design was sort of born post-war as everybody knows, with the flight of residents to the
21   suburbs, and our downtowns sort of collapsed. We tried beautification projects to bring
22   businesses back with great mall projects like Fresno and Santa Monica and Sacramento. We all
23   know those and they all failed. Beautification doesn’t really work to bring businesses back. We
24   have smaller examples right on California Avenue, the beautification project of the 1980s. It
25   didn’t really do much for California Avenue either. So I think we need to move beyond thinking
26   that, as an architect beautification is great, but I don’t think we should be arguing that this going
27   to stimulate business or bring people there.
28
29   The second aspect, and I think the project is really right on on this, urban design is really the
30   connectivity, making streets safer, making traffic flow better, and I think the project does a good
31   job of that. That is a real important part of what this project is about. I think we didn’t
32   emphasize the safety aspect of that enough. I think there is a lot of it in terms of slowing traffic,
33   because I think two lanes of wide open space is going to let traffic go a little faster. Having one
34   lane with bicycles right there and diagonal parking on the side, I think we are really going to
35   make the street safer for both cars and pedestrians and bicycles. So it is a great urban design
36   aspect of the project.
37
38   The third and the most important, and I think the one Commissioner Fineberg was alluding to
39   was land use. We can say that Castro Street really has done this remarkable revitalization but it
40   was land use. Because before the street changes to two lanes it was all Chinese restaurants if you
41   can remember, and business were really a lot worse off than California Avenue. With the change
42   it wasn’t just making the street narrower and the sidewalks wider it was bringing in the
43   Performance Art Center and the other things that Commissioner Garber mentioned. So land use
44   has to be an important component of this when it comes around in our discussion. The street
45   infrastructure is an important one.
