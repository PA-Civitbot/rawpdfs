IV.   Quasi-Judicial Hearings

      A. Policy. It is the policy of the Council to assure that the due process rights of all
      persons are protected during City hearings. A “quasi-judicial” hearing is a hearing
      that requires a higher level of procedural due process because of the potential impact
      on life, liberty or property. Usually, quasi-judicial hearings involve a single parcel
      of land and apply facts and evidence in the context of existing law. Findings must
      be stated to explain the evidentiary basis for the Council’s decision.

             1. Purpose. These rules are intended to assure that City Council decision
             making on quasi-judicial matters is based upon facts and evidence known to
             all parties and to support the autonomy of Boards and Commissions in




                                                                                                                                   Attachment: 2.15.11 (1422 : Policy and Services Agenda 2/15/2011)
             making recommendations to Council.                                                 Comment [r3]: Not approved by City
                                                                                                Council on 11/22/10. Referred back to
                                                                                                P&S. Not discussed at 12/14 P&S.
      B. General Requirements.

             1. Quasi-Judicial Proceedings Defined. Quasi-judicial proceedings subject
             to these procedural rules include hearings involving the following matters:

                    a) Conditional Use Permits
                    b) Variances
                    c) Home Improvement Exceptions
                    d) Design Enhancement Exceptions
                    e) Subdivisions, other than final map approvals
                    f) Architectural Review
                    g) Assessment protest hearings
                    h) Other matters as determined by the City Attorney
                    i) Appeals related to any of the above
                    j) Environmental Review relating to any of the above
             2. Restrictions on Council Communications Outside of Quasi-Judicial and
                Planned Community Zone Hearings. It is the policy of the Council to
                discourage the gathering and submission of information by Council
                Members outside of any noticed public meeting, prior to final
                recommendations by the Architectural Review Board or Planning &
                Transportation Commission. The following procedural guidelines are
                intended to implement this policy, but shall not be construed to create
                any remedy or right of action.                                                  Comment [G4]: Verbiage approved
                                                                                                by motion at Policy & Services meeting
                    k) Identification of Quasi-Judicial Matters. The City Attorney, in          on 12/14/10. Pending Council Approval.
                    conjunction with the City Clerk and City Manager, will identify
                    agenda items involving quasi-judicial decisions on both the tentative
                    and regular Council agendas. This identification is intended to
                    inform the Council, interested parties, and the public that this policy
                    will apply to the item.
