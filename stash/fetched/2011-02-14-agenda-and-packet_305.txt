                                        permitted upon items upon the consent calendar; however,
                                        any Council Member may request that his or her vote be
                                        recorded as a "no" or "not participating" due to a specified
                                        conflict of interest on any individual item. Council Members

                                        statements in a manner consistent with the Brown Act and




                                                                                                                        Attachment: 2.15.11 (1422 : Policy and Services Agenda 2/15/2011)
                                        shall assure that the minutes of the meeting make reference to
                                        the existence and location of such written statements.

                                        (b) Public Comment. If members of the public wish to speak
                                        to items on the Consent Calendar, the Mayor will have the
                                        option of allowing the testimony prior to adoption of the
                                        Consent Calendar, or removing the item from the consent
                                        calendar and hearing the public comment at a later time, prior
                                        to the vote on the item.

                                        (c) Council Requests to Remove Item. Any Council Member
                                        may request that an item be removed from the consent
                                        calendar; if the request is seconded, the item will be removed
                                        from the consent calendar. The City Managerâ€™s office should
                                        be advised, in writing, of a request for removal no later than
                                        noon the day of the meeting.

                                        heard either later in the meeting or agendized for a discussion
                                        at a subsequent meeting, depending upon the number of
                                        speakers and the anticipated length of the items that have
                                        been officially scheduled for discussion on a particular
                                        evening. The Mayor will decide when during the meeting
                                        any removed items will be heard.

                                        (e) Consent calendar categories. The consent calendar shall
                                        be presented in 5 categories in the following order:
