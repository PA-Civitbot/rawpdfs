                                                                                                                   10.d




 1   a bike share station facility near the entrance of the station itself, potentially on that plaza or
 2   somewhere near there.

 4   Vice-Chair Lippert: A quick question. That 128 proposed parking spaces, does that include




                                                                                                                          Attachment: Attachment D: P&TC Excerpt Minutes of January 12, 2011 (1320 : California Avenue Neg Dec and CIP)
 5   handicapped on street?

 7   Mr. Rodriguez: With this design we didn’t introduce any brand new – we didn’t propose any
 8   disabled parking spaces. I think as we move forward with design if the community so wants that
 9   we can reintroduce that. The only disabled parking spaces today are the one that is in front of
10   Mollie Stone’s. This actually proposes to remove that disabled space.
11
12   Vice-Chair Lippert: Actually, I think you have a couple of disabled parking spaces on California
13   Avenue. You might want to take a look at that.
14
15   Mr. Rodriguez: Any other questions?
16
17   Chair Tuma: Procedurally, go ahead and wrap up. We are going to go to the public and then we
18   will come back for questions. Okay, great.
19
20   Okay, a couple of things. Just for the record, Commissioner Fineberg joined us right after the
21   roll call but before this item started. So she was here for the whole item.
22
23   We are going to go to the public now. At this point I have only four cards from members of the
24   public. So if there is anybody else who would like to speak please bring the cards up to the table
25   here. Anybody else? Okay. So with that we will go through members of the public. I think we
26   are going to have six, seven, eight, or something like that. So members of the public will have
27   four minutes apiece to address the Commission. We will start with it looks like Gil McMillan to
28   be followed by Robyn Duby. Welcome.
29
30   Mr. Gil McMillan, Palo Alto: Okay, I guess I will just bullet it. Number one, who asked for
31   this? It has never been made clear. I have attended any number of or at least three or four
32   meetings of business folk and the residential meetings. There was never a strong sentiment
33   expressed for it. There were serious negative sentiments expressed against it in each meeting,
34   which the gentleman neglected to mention.
35
36   As to cyclists on the sidewalk, right now they are a hazard. The sidewalks are narrow. There are
37   restaurant tables and chairs. And as I understand it the chairs will merely increase the number of
38   people riding the bikes on the sidewalk because with one lane and cars backing out it is going to
39   be more hazardous for cyclists than less. I am there every day I see it. The second lane is
40   available for backing out so that the traffic continues to flow, a fact which I think the traffic
41   survey did not consider.
42
43   The other thing is you might test this concept with paint. For $5,000 to $10,000 you could paint
44   these in and see whether this is going to work or not before committing this much money to a
45   project of questionable value.
