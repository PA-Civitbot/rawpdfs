Mr. Kniss said the antenna could extend between 26 and 40 feet.

Council Member Freeman asked whether the accessory building would be
used for residential purposes at any point.

Mr. Kniss said no. The accessory building would be used as shade from the
elements and for storage.

Council Member Freeman asked whether the home-office would be included.

Mr. Kniss said no.

Council Member Freeman referred to Page 1 of Attachment "A"
(CMR:515:03) of the Record of Land Use Approval that stated, "Accessory to
this use would be a structure of approximately 1,227 square feet for storage
of garden and orchard related equipment, and containing a bathroom and
home office areas."

Mr. Kniss said the structure would have a bathroom and a sink. The rest of
the space was an open area.

Council Member Freeman said the text related to "home-office" could be
extracted from the Record.

Mr. Kniss said yes.

Council Member Burch said he imagined Mr. Kniss would need a table to set
the ham radio on and a couple of chairs to sit in. Perhaps those items
referred to the "home-office".

Mr. Kniss agreed.

Herb Borock, P.O. Box 632, said the proposed project was part of a four-lot
subdivision, whereby the Council approved a Preliminary Parcel Map for the
subdivision on July 17, 1978, under Resolution No. 5573. One of the
conditions was a dedication of a one-foot wide non-access strip along the
entire frontage of Page Mill Road, except for the two driveway openings
indicated on the final map and could not find any indication of a non-access
strip. He also questioned whether a Conditional Use Permit (CUP) was
needed for the communication facility. When a communication device was
erected without approval of the design of the device, it was hard to know
what it would be 10 or 20 years down the road. It was the role of the
Architectural Review Board (ARB) to review the design of a facility.
