Council Member Drekmeier recommended after 2018, the site would be used
for commercial or mixed-use and not just housing.

Mr. Williams said similar mix of uses would need to maintain the same
amount of retail for the square footage.

Council Member Drekmeier had concerns of locking the Fry’s location into
commercial zoning.

Mr. Emslie said he was assigned to return to the Council with a proposal that
preserved Fry’s and presented strategies.

Council Member Drekmeier said the vote was scheduled for October 26,
2006.

Mr. Emslie said he was requested to prepare a recommendation, with
strategies, for retaining Fry’s and the retail components.

Council Member Drekmeier said he thought staff had returned the
recommendation that evening.

Mr. Emslie said research would take time to develop the economic, land use,
architectural and environmental analysis to maintain compatibility with
surrounding areas.

Council Member Drekmeier said the explanation was not clear.

Mr. Emslie said the Council discussed the Planning and Transportation
Commission’s recommendation on Pedestrian and Transit Oriented Design
(PTOD). It was decided not to be included. The Planning Department was
requested to propose a land use recommendation that addressed retail on
the ground floor.

Vice Mayor Kishimoto asked to wait on the vote until the recommendation
was returned.

Mr. Emslie said any action taken would not preclude options.

Council Member Barton supported removal of the amortization.

Mayor Kleinberg said the zoning ordinance chapters, the amortization, and
the signage items would be voted on separately.

MOTION: Council Member Beecham moved, seconded by Klein, to approve
staff and the Planning and Transportation Commission (P&TC)
recommendation to adopt the Ordinance Deleting Chapters 18.41
(Neighborhood Commercial), 18.44 (Community Commercial Combining
