Council Member Morton asked for clarification on the policy shift in the target
market. He asked how people were qualified under the current policy.

Mr. Emslie stated for ownership, the qualification was the applicant earned
between 80 and 120 percent of the County Median.

Council Member Morton clarified the current residents in some of the areas
would be considered significantly below what would now qualify for
ownership.

Mr. Emslie stated yes, due to the restrictions on equity of the unit.

Council Member Morton stated in the current program, the qualifying
individual secured their own funding.

Mr. Emslie stated yes.

Council Member Morton stated to run a rental program with the BMR
percentages, the City would need to come up with the funding and there
would be a diverse stock scattered in various locations.

Mr. Emslie stated yes that was correct

Council Member Morton asked whether the restoration of the units costs
came out of the sale price.

Mr. Emslie stated at times the cost of restoration has been included in the
sale price, however the unit cost needed to remain in the program.

Council Member Morton asked regarding the increase in deed restrictions
from 49 to 89 years. He stated his concern regarding the inheritance clause.

Mr. Emslie stated the clause was a way to maintain affordability of the units
for the entirety of the units availability.

Council Member Morton asked why the term was not stated as 99 years.

Mr. Emslie stated there had been attorney input stating 89 years was more
defensible than 99 years.

Council Member Morton asked for clarification on how the City was going to
revise the buyers financing options.

Mr. Emslie stated there were programs available to assist buyers in
qualifying.
