Planning and Community Environment Director Steve Emslie responded he
thought it was possible that Agenda Item Number 16 could be included into
the Comp. Plan Update.

Council Member Yeh asked if it would require a discussion on Item Number
16 or Council Action to formerly include that as part of a future item to be
discussed by the Council.

Mr. Emslie responded it could be general Staff direction but a Motion would
demonstrate the Councilâ€™s intent.

Council Member Yeh proposed to the maker of the Motion to include the
study of Public and Private Streets into the Comp. Plan.

Council Member Kishimoto responded that she was open to discussion on
that issue.

Council Member Yeh asked about the timeline.


Mr. Emslie responded that it would be handled much like the Zoning Code
update in which parts of it would advance and come to some sort of
tentative conclusion before the Comp. Plan update timeline.

Council Member Kishimoto responded that she would not accept the
proposed Amendment.

AMENDMENT: Council Member Yeh moved, seconded by Council Member
Morton to include the study of the Pros vs. Cons into the Comprehensive
Plan work under Agenda Item Number 16.

Council Member Burt asked Mr. Emslie about the legal process for adoption
of Comp. Plan revisions. Specific Comp. Plan Amendments were allowed
each year to the existing Comp. Plan and that could be done as piece meal
like a Zoning Ordinance update.

Planning and Community Environment Director Steve Emslie responded
there were 4 revisions per element per year.

Council Member Burt inquired if Staff was envisioning that the Council would
be amending the current Comp. Plan but, based upon the work product of
the Comp. Plan Update.

Mr. Emslie responded that was possible, it seemed to be an effective way of
engaging people to come to a conclusion.
