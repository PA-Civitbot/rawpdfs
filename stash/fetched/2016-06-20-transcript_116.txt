Council Member Holman: I don't want to become the one that just always
does this. I did want to adjourn tonight's meeting in honor of Joe Shakes,
who passed away recently. Joe, as many of you know and many people in
the community know, was very involved in the community and very involved
in a lot of local campaigns until his declining health in the last few years. He
and his wife, Harriette, are well known to this community and members of
this community, their involvement. They will now both be greatly missed.
I'd like to adjourn the meeting in their honor.

Adjournment:    The meeting was adjourned in memory of Joe Shakes at
11:52 P.M.

Mayor Burt: So moved. Good night.
