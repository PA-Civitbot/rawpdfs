                         TRANSCRIPT

James Keene, City Manager: Thank you, Mr. Mayor, Council Members. I'm
looking at the pulling of the item as more of a procedural matter than
substantive. That's not to diminish from the discussion. I think actually
when we have the discussion, if it goes Finance, it can be resolved, I think,
pretty quickly. Almost instinctively this is essentially an enterprise funded
program with 100 percent of the costs offset by fees, both on the Business
Registry and otherwise. We do have like real life deadlines, so we need to
put this on the Finance Committee Agenda, if you do this, at the next
meeting which is on the 16th. I think the meeting isâ€”the Agenda is not so
heavy that that presents a problem. We need to try to come back to the
Council on the 22nd. The implications on our existing Staff of the burdens
that are out there and with the public with an advertised date of starting on
March 1st just means that if we want to do this process, that's find. We just
need Council to work with the schedule with us on this also so that we can
support and handle the phone calls and things that are going to be coming in
as best as we can.

Vice Mayor Scharff: If Finance supports it, of course I'm happy with it
coming back on the Consent Calendar.

Mayor Burt: I see no more lights, so please vote on the board. That passes
unanimously. Item Number 7b will be referred to Finance Committee.

MOTION PASSED: 9-0
