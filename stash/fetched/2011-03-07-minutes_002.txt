SPECIAL ORDERS OF THE DAY

2.   Community Partners Non-Profit Presentation - Canopy.

Canopy representative, Catherine Martineau stated Canopy was started 15
years ago by the City Council. They work with the Cities of Palo Alto, East
Palo Alto and Mountain View. Their goal is to protect and grow the urban
forest by tree plantings; care, education, and outreach are several of their
programs. There was an Arbor Day Festival planned on Saturday, March 12,
2011 in Eleanor Pardee Park.

Mayor Espinosa stated this portion of the agenda was a recommendation by
Council Member Klein in an effort to showcase the City’s non-profit partners.

Council Member Shepherd asked for details with respect to Canopy’s gifting
policy.

Ms. Martineau stated a gift purchased through Canopy would provide a tree
being planted during the planting season. The gifter can choose the
designated location of the tree; however, there cannot be a plaque at the
site.

Vice Mayor Yeh asked how community members could participate in or
volunteer for Canopy.

Ms. Martineau stated there were many different avenues citizens could take
and the first one would be to visit the Canopy website to view the listing of
upcoming events.

3.   Proclamation of the Council of the City of Palo Alto for National Arbor
     Day and California Arbor Week.
