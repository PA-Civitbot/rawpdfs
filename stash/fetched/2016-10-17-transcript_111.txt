Mayor Burt: Council Member Kniss?

Council Member Kniss: Nope.

Mayor Burt: Council Member Berman?

Council Member Berman: Just quickly. I don't know if other folks want to
do it. A bunch of us attended the Athena Awards last Tuesday, where Palo
Alto's very own Karen—I'm aware I'm going to mispronounce your last
name—Kienzle, the Director of the Palo Alto Art Center was awarded the
Athena Award, very deserving. I just wanted to give her a shout-out.

Mayor Burt: Vice Mayor Scharff, did you have anything else?

Vice Mayor Scharff: I did. I just wanted to report that I've been asked to
Chair the BCDC, the Bay Conservation Development Commission's
Enforcement Committee.

Council Member Kniss: Which committee?

Vice Mayor Scharff: Enforcement Committee.

Mayor Burt: Interesting. Council Member Holman, you have something else
now?

Council Member Holman: Yeah. If we're going to be self-congratulatory, I
will bring up that last Friday morning I was given an honor by Project We
Hope, a civic award, along with Former Mayor Lisa Gauthier of East Palo
Alto.

Mayor Burt: Great. Thank you. Congratulations.

Adjournment: The meeting was adjourned at 11:40 P.M.

Mayor Burt: That concludes our meeting.
