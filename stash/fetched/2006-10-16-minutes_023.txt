Council Member Drekmeier mentioned he received a call from a reporter
alerting him that there was debris, as well as logs marked for removal, in
the creeks along Highway 101. The Water District Director said there was
an issue that Palo Alto would not allow disposal of the debris in the dump.
Steelhead spawning would be affected if the creek was not cleared of debris.

Council Member Beecham noted he attended the Annual Meeting of the
Northern California Power Agency (NCPA) meeting with Council Member
Mossar two weeks ago. The main topic was global warming and the impact
on utilities and electric generation.

Mayor Kleinberg noted she heard Senator Diane Feinstein speak today
regarding global warming and she was proposing legislation which affected
Palo Alto.
