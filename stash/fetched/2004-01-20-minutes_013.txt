traffic-adaptive signal technology and component three was converting one-
half the total corridor length from a four-lane to a three-lane cross section.

Mr. Emslie said staff would like to have the flexibility to move forward on the
trial if the funds for the trial were secured, and the traffic adaptive was not
in place.

Council Member Kishimoto asked if the two components could be linked in a
reasonable manner.

Mr. Emslie said the two components should be as close as possible to one
another.

Council Member Kishimoto said the increase in Palo Alto children biking, and
taking the shuttle was a result of engineering, enforcement, education, and
encouraging alternatives.

Vice Mayor Burch spoke for Council Member Kleinberg, who had laryngitis.
Council Member Kleinberg asked if lane reduction would be tied to the traffic
adaptive signal system.

Mr. Emslie said there was an ability to put the trial lane reductions in place
with the already funded improved signal timing, but not the traffic adaptive.
The improved signal timing was underway and would be in place by the end
of the calendar year.

Vice Mayor Burch asked when the one-year trial began.

Mr. Emslie said the trial would begin when the funding was available.

Vice Mayor Burch asked if the trial would begin when the traffic signals and
lane reductions were in place.

Mr. Emslie said the signal improvements were underway, which would
enable staff to trial the lane reductions.

Vice Mayor Burch asked a question on behalf of Council Member Kleinberg.
How removable were the fixtures and the medians and the trees, if the trial
did not meet the criteria.

Mr. Emslie said improvements were readily removable without major de-
construction.
