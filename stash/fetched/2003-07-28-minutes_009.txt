Director of Planning and Community Environment Steve Emslie said
the appeal on the Home Improvement Exception Application (HIE) was
a process allowed under the Zoning Code by which the strict
application of the zoning standards could be modified slightly when the
findings were of an inferior design. The Planning Commission
unanimously found the HIE findings were present as the proposal
resulted in a superior design. The project’s individual review was not
appealed and not a subject for Council’s consideration that evening.

Planning Manager Amy French gave project details as outlined in the
staff report (CMR:328:03). She noted the appellant was concerned
about the noticing of the item. Attachment J of the staff report
outlined the noticing. The Zoning Code did not require advance
written notice to neighbors announcing the Council’s review of
variance use from HIE appeals, where a 12-day advance notice was
required for a Commission review for HIE Appeals.

City Attorney Ariel Calonne noted the item was quasi-judicial and
Council Members needed to disclose any contacts prior to the public
hearing.

Council Member Kishimoto said she took a five-minute walk through
the site.

Council Member Lytle said she toured the exterior of the site.

Council Member Kleinberg said she drove by and viewed the property
but had no interaction with the Samos family.

Mayor Mossar said she visited the site and took a five-minute walk-
through.

Council Member Burch said he drove by the site.

Council Member Ojakian said he went by site and spoke to Mr. Samos.

Council Members Beecham, Freeman and Morton said they had
nothing to report.

Mayor Mossar declared the Public Hearing open at 7:35 p.m.

A.J. Gokcek, representing appellant, Omer Gokcek, who was away on
government business, 765 San Antonio Road, said the reason he
attended the meeting was to allow the appeal and reject the Director
