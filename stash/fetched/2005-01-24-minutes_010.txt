Council Member Freeman expressed concern that the PAUSD might not be
aware of the proposed project.

Mr. Emslie said he would verify with staff whether the PAUSD received
notice.

Vice Mayor Kleinberg said she understood when the Council voted for or
against housing, they were not to take into account impacts on schools. She
asked if that was correct.

Mr. Baum said the Council could take into consideration the broad context;
however, they were limited to the findings. The item could only be denied on
the findings. The State statue referred to by the Director of Planning and
Community Environment capped the fees for schools at a certain level. The
PAUSD raised those fees to the maximum.

Council Member Freeman asked what each housing unit was priced at.

Mr. Hinds said in 2005 dollars they would cost approximately $700,000 to
$900,000. The BMR units would sell for half of the market rate prices.

Council Member Freeman said she noticed the Tentative Map had private
roads on it. She asked staff whether it was common to have private roads in
developments.

Mr. Emslie said yes. It occurred most often in developments where
Homeowner Association Fees (HOA) maintained the parking and
landscaping.

Council Member Freeman clarified the homeowners would have to take care
of the internal streets. She said page three of the Tentative Map indicated
the Public Utility Easement (PUE) would be abandoned; however, the
subsequent page showed new PUE’s. She asked who would pay for the new
PUE’s.

Mr. Emslie said the Tentative Map reflected a change in location of the PUE
and all the costs were borne by the developer. The City incurred no costs in
the relocation.

Council Member Freeman asked whether the old PUE’s would remain or be
removed.

Mr. Emslie the old PUE’s would be disposed of in a way approved by the City
Utilities Department.
