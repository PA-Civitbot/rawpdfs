         matters back for Council consideration at future meetings, but no action can be
         taken. During regular study sessions, public comments are typically received
         together with oral communications at the end of the session or at another appropriate
         time at the discretion of the chair. During special study sessions, public comments
         will be heard at the end of any Council discussion, but oral communications will be
         consolidated with the oral communications section of the regular meeting, if one
         follows the study session. The Decorum rules still apply to the behavior of the
         Council and public.                                                                             Comment [G1]: Council Member

         closed sessions to discuss pending litigation, employment issues, real estate
         negotiations and certain other matters. Members of the public are permitted to make
         public comments on closed session matters. The Council must make a public report




                                                                                                                                                Attachment: 2.15.11 (1422 : Policy and Services Agenda 2/15/2011)

             These are guidelines, not rules. The Council intends that City staff and Council
         Members will follow these guidelines. However, these guidelines should not be
         used in a way that leads to inefficiency, unfairness, or the promotion of form over
         substance. State law establishes a variety of mandatory meeting rules the City must
         follow in order to assure open and public government, regardless of unusual
         situations and consequences.
