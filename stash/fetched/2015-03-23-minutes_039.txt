Council Member Questions, Comments and Announcements

Council Member Scharff attended the Expressway Plan 2040 meeting where
he learned the County of Santa Clara had not maintained expressways since
2010. The City should advocate for funding of the expressway systems as

to fund expressways. By 2025, a significant portion of expressways would
reach Level of Service F if no action was taken.

Council Member Wolbach indicated the Gunn High School production of
Anything Goes was fantastic.

Council Member Burt was a panelist at the Local Government Commission
Annual Conference.       Topics included Climate Action Plan and carbon
