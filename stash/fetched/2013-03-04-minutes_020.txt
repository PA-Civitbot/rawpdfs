Council Member Klein disagreed. This was a different type of PC in that the
Developer did not receive extra square feet to develop.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to add a number 9. When staff returns, they will
recommend to Council an appropriate amount of the fine based on the
amount of the savings likely to be achieved by the Developer from moving
forward with construction of the housing, using actual numbers volunteered
by the Developer or, if he is not willing to share such data, numbers
obtained from knowledgeable people in the industry.

Vice Mayor Shepherd agreed with moving forward with the housing. She
had concerns for the neighborhood with regard to stopping construction
work.

Council Member Berman believed many residents of the community
supported the Project. He appreciated the Applicant's comments, and hoped
the Developer would provide numbers to determine the public benefit for the
revised PC.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to permit only six units to move forward as soon
as administratively possible, the two units directly behind Building 2 will be
stayed pending further direction of Council through the amendment of the
PC.

Vice Mayor Shepherd asked why Staff recommended housing proceed when
the Applicant indicated only six units would be constructed.

Mr. Williams explained there was discussion at one point of the Developer
constructing only four model homes.

Vice Mayor Shepherd asked the Applicant if he was planning on constructing
only six homes.

Mr. Tze did not plan to construct all ten units at once. The first phase would
be six units based on how quickly permits could be obtained.

Council Member Kniss accepted the language, but did not want to preclude
the Developer from building ten units.
