                      DRAFT MINUTES
MOTION FAILED DUE TO THE LACK OF A SECOND

Mayor Shepherd recalled in 2012 the Council was learning about the
Stanford University Medical Center Development Agreement as well as other
items. She was unaware the City owned the property. The community
deserved a full history of the City's ownership of the property. She was
concerned about ambiguous portions of the Comprehensive Plan. She did
not recall deliberating regarding the 7.7 acres or 27 University Avenue. She
did meet with Mr. Arrillaga and listened to his proposal. The City did not
have a process for Staff to present a gift proposal to the Council.

Mr. Keene added his apology for the lack of process. He regretted his role in
designing and participating in a process that was wrong for the City.

MOTION AS AMENDED PASSED: 8-0 Price absent

Council Member Klein noted he did not vote on the portion of the response
pertaining to 27 University Avenue.

Mayor Shepherd appointed Council Members Burt and Schmid to the
Subcommittee.
