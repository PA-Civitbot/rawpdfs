Mr. Turner felt that was not entirely accurate. He thought perhaps that was
part of the Housing Element Policy, which had been changed through an
Ordinance.

COUNCIL MEMBER QUESTIONS, COMMENTS, AND ANNOUNCEMENTS

Council Member Price reported on an action recently taken by the Santa
Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) Board of Directors.        She
indicated the VTA awarded a $772 million design-build contract for the Bay
Area Rapid Transit (BART) Silicon Valley-Berryessa Extension Project, which
was the first phase of the 16-mile BART extension to Santa Clara Valley.
She reported the VTA Board had recommended to Caltrans that a new
district be created to include at a minimum Santa Clara County. She stated
this recommendation would provide Caltrans engineers to Santa Clara Valley
and would reduce the review time for worthy projects. She indicated the
recommendation would allow the proposed district to introduce innovative
practices and electronic project review and approval.

Mayor Espinosa noted the Police Department's ride-along program remained
in effect, and invited Council Members and members of the public to
participate. He congratulated the Police Department on an incredible class
of officers being promoted.

ADJOURNMENT: The meeting was adjourned at 9:11 P.M.
