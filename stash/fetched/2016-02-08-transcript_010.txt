Consent Calendar

Mayor Burt: Our next item is the Consent Calendar. Do we have a motion
to approve? Vice Mayor Scharff.

Vice Mayor Scharff: I'd like to pull Item Number 6.

Mayor Burt: I will support that. So will Council Member Filseth.

MOTION: Vice Mayor Scharff moved, seconded by Mayor Burt, third by
Council Member Filseth to pull Agenda Item Number 6- Approval   of
Amendment to Table of Organizationâ€¦ to become Agenda Item Number
7b.

Mayor Burt: I'm trying to think procedurally, since we've pulled it, are you
wanting to have this as a Council discussion or a referral?

Vice Mayor Scharff: I want to refer it to Finance for proper vetting of ...

Mayor Burt: How do we do that under our rules?

Molly Stump, City Attorney: The rules provide the Mayor and the City
Manager to confer on whether the item can be heard tonight or agendized
for another Council meeting. I think it would need to be done that way, and
then the Council could refer it to a Committee if it so chose.

James Keene, City Manager: Could I just clarify that, just a little bit? I
think our procedures allow us either to take this up as a first discussion point
on the Agenda, subject to how the Mayor may want to do that. I would
suggest we do that on this one just since we did hand out some material
that would take a minute for us to at least go over. If your decision is to
refer it to Finance, you could make that direction at that point in the Action
Item.
