constructing the parking structure first and then two years to build the
police building.

Joy Ogawa spoke of the monies wasted on prior police building plans
and urged the Council to follow through with a plan and not waste any
more funds on future plans.

Herb Borock, P.O. Box 632, spoke of the Council not being able to

Robert Moss, 4010 Orme, said he would verify and provide the Council
with information as to whether the property on 640 and 1501 Page Mill

payment on an agreed price and completion of the payment and
acquisition would depend upon the ballot measure being passed and
approved; or 2) purchase the property and resell at a higher price.

Carl Anderson, 4044 Amarant Avenue, was in favor of the California

be in close proximity to the Courthouse. A new and improved building
would withstand a catastrophic disaster, which is essential for retaining
and housing a high quality police personnel force.
