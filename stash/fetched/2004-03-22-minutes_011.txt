 Ginny Laibl, 216 Webster Street, said she lived in a vibrant Downtown
 area. Other measures could be used instead of street closures.

 Danusia Szumowski, 134 Tasso Street, said she supported the current
 traffic measures. She hoped there would be foresight beyond the
 immediate future.

 Geoff Ball, 315 Bryant Street, said the traffic calming had been beneficial
 for safety.   One of the goals was to move the traffic out of the
 neighborhood and onto the arterials.

 Melissa Kelton, 227 Webster Street, said the closures had dramatically
 changed her routine. She found it was faster and easier to walk, or ride
 her bicycle, to do errands.

 Stan Buginskis, 318 Middlefield Road, said the traffic blocking had diverted
 traffic onto other streets. He said other measures could be used to achieve
 the objectives, such as speed bumps, speed tables or traffic circles.

 Debbie Walter, 318 Middlefield Road, said she believed there should be
 traffic speeding reductions, but not traffic blockages.

 Susan Hathaway, 150 Webster Street, asked for less drastic measures than
 traffic blocking.

 LaNell Mimmack, 422 Palo Alto Avenue, said she believed the staff had
 come up with a good traffic-calming plan.

 Sara Benson, 245 Emerson Street, Apt. B, said a divisive implementation
 for traffic calming had been chosen and caused the divisiveness in the
 neighborhood.

 Tricia Ward-Dolkas, 412 Everett Street, said unique problems required
 unique solutions. She supported the staff report (CMR:180:04) of the
 compromised proposal of the Modified Mixed Measures Plan.

 Steve Kutner, 275 Hawthorne Avenue, said the traffic calming was a failed
 process, showed disregard for the Comprehensive Plan and the petition of
 over 1,300 people.

 Robert E. Johnson, 307 Emerson Street, said the traffic calming design had
 not solved problems but had moved them to another area.
