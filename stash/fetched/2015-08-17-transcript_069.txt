Mayor Holman: Understood. City Attorney, do I need a motion to move
Item Number 25 forward and table this item?

Molly Stump, City Attorney: Just ask for a quick motion. I'm sure you'll get
it. You're not moving any item off the agenda at this point.

Mayor Holman: Not at this point.

Ms. Stump: You're just changing the order.

Mayor Holman: Yes.

Council Member Kniss: Madam Mayor, I move (inaudible).

Council Member Wolbach: Second.

Mayor Holman: We have a motion to move by Council Member Kniss, and
second by Council Member Wolbach, to move Item Number 25 into the
agenda now and table Item Number 24 until after 25 is dispatched.

MOTION: Council Member Kniss moved, seconded by Council Member
Wolbach to move Agenda Item Number 25- Adoption of a Resolution
Amending the Affordable Housing Guidelines to Permit Use of the
Commercial Housing Fund for Preservation of Existing Units forward to be
heard now.

Mr. Keene: If I might state the obvious. Obviously the move to do this
quickly would be so that the Council could endorse and support the
recommendations on Number 25 most likely.

Mayor Holman: It looks as though it's going to be a quick one, so yes. Vote
on the board please. There we go. That passes unanimously on an 8-0 vote
with Council Member Scharff absent.

MOTION PASSED: 8-0 Scharff absent

Mayor Holman: We will be taking up Item Number 25.

25.   Resolution 9539 Entitled, “Resolution of the Council of the City of Palo
      Alto Amending and Updating the Housing Reserve Guidelines as the
      Affordable Housing Fund Guidelines.”

James Keene, City Manager: I think the report is clear.        We're here to
answer questions if you need it.
