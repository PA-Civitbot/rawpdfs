STUDY SESSION

2.   City Council Study Session with Senator Simitian Proposed Topics of
     Discussion.

Senator Simitian addressed Vice Mayor Scharff’s question regarding the
regional housing needs allocation transfer request with Santa Clara County.
He said the housing allocation should be a condition of the development so
as not to aggravate the housing imbalance. He said there were challenges
getting the State to understand the imbalance in part due to student
housing. He addressed a Staff Member’s question regarding the California
High Speed Rail and Caltrain rail corridor. He said there had been some
good outcomes from the outreach of Palo Alto and other organizations
including the commitment to a blended system and the projected cost of the
total build out had been reduced dramatically. He encouraged the City to
return to the Legislature again to get commitments confirmed. He discussed
the issue of a raised tax vote by the people, the Governor’s office process
and the opportunity for trigger cuts to be implemented depending on the
upcoming election.
