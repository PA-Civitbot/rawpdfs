would be the builders, implementers, and operators of the project.
PacketFront was another partner who provided the technical, electronic
solutions and would not be investing.

Mayor Kishimoto asked who would write the business plan.

Mr. Saccio stated NorthStar, PacketFront and 180 Connect would work on it.
NorthStar was primarily responsible for the business plan and the financial
modeling.

Mayor Kishimoto asked how much of the General Fund would be at risk.

Mr. Yeats stated it would be hard to determine.

Mayor Kishimoto asked whether they could limit what could be put at risk.

Mr. Yeats replied they were attempting to limit the Cityâ€™s financial
involvement.

Vice Mayor Klein stated $15 to $20 million was far in excess of a minimal
investment.

Mr. Yeats stated that was what was presented. He stated he would not
recommend committing $15 million to this project with all the other City
commitments.

Andy Poggio stated the $15 million was not a fixed number.

Bob Harrington stated there was potential to come up with value for the
partnership that would be in the zone of $15 million.

Jeff Mazer, CFA, NorthStar Capital Partners, stated there were possible
sources of credit enhancement and hard assets that the City could contribute
to this project and may be possible to finance this entire project.

Council Member Beecham stated the PowerPoint presentation compared to
the RFP were different. Cash guarantees were not mentioned. He asked
whether the assets like dark fiber were of more value to the consortium or to
the City.

Mr. Mazer stated the consortium could make them live assets.

Council Member Beecham asked if the City was to take the position that they
were not ready to put up cash or guarantees, where would it leave the
consortium.
