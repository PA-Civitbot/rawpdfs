moved technology services to the cloud. When asked whether City systems
have ever been hacked, Staff responded by saying that it was not about
when, but if the City would know that systems have been hacked - this is a
key reason for hiring a Security Manager in 2012. Staff recently
implemented an extra layer of security (firewall) and is currently underway
with implementing measures to further prepare for security incidents. If
more funding were made available Staff would propose a dedicated
procurement resource to help expedite the purchasing process for
technology solutions. Last year Staff deployed an open data platform which
was the basis for sharing all the data of the City with the community. A data
strategy should be developed for how data would be leveraged for decision-
making. Many cities look to Palo Alto for innovation. At the same time Palo
Alto looks at other cities in California as well as large cities like Chicago, New
York and Boston for leveraging ideas for innovation. Regarding the City
Website updates Staff said the top two functionalities were: improve search
functionality and increase compatibility for mobile access. Staff expected the
upgrade to be no earlier than one year from now.
