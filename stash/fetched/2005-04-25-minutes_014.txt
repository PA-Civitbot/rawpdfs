Vice Mayor Kleinberg said there was a precedent for subsidizing those who
were unable to economically handle the current rates in some areas of
utilities.

Mr. Ulrich said a portion of the recommendations were for increased fees
that currently existed.

Council Member Freeman said the budget should be reviewed. Matters that
brought revenue to the City should be evaluated.

Council Member Morton said assistance to non-profit housing groups was
provided by other means, not by gerrymandering the fees.

Mr. Ulrich said developers and those who impacted the utility system should
pay the fees.

Mayor Burch said the fee increase had a unanimous recommendation from
the Finance Committee. The water connection fee was substantially lower
than in neighboring cities.

Council Member Cordell asked the member of the public who spoke earlier to
explain what the impact would be on their development.

Mr. McCarthy said the proposed water and wastewater fees were estimated
to be an impact of $200,000 to $300,000.

Mayor Burch declared the Public Hearing closed at 8:50 p.m.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION FAILED 2-4, Cordell, Kleinberg yes, Beecham,
Mossar, Ojakian absent.

AMENDMENT: Vice Mayor Kleinberg moved, seconded by Cordell, to accept
the main motion with a provision that any project submitted that is 100
percent BMR units, that there be a point in process that the project would be
exempted from this rate addition.

Mr. Baum suggested that a point of exemption decision could be made by
the Council to be when the application was accepted as completed.

Vice Mayor Kleinberg asked what point would apply to that project.

Mr. Baum said it could be narrowed down to a project that was 100 percent
BMR.
