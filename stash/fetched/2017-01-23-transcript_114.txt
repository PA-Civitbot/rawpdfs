Mayor Scharff: It may or may not be a good idea. Clearly Council Members
have the right to change the RPP Program.

Ms. Gitelman: I'm just trying to clarify whether the Council Members are

Council Member Fine: I was originally intending to talk about RPP. I

program where we're trying to adjudicate between different uses. For
example, medical offices are not the same as personal services. We would
end up asking our parking permit contractor to be making these kind of calls
about various land uses. We thought it would take time and energy away
from other aspects of this program that need our attention. It was purely
about the administrative burden.

Council Member Holman: When the business registration goes in, there isn't
a basic category ofâ€”it's been a while since I looked at it. Isn't it a basic
