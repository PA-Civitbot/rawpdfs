Mayor Kleinberg asked about the setback change along El Camino, allowing
properties to move closer to the street and if the sidewalks would be
widened.

Mr. Williams said the plan calls for twelve foot wide sidewalks.

Mayor Kleinberg asked if there would be room for landscape with the
building close to the sidewalk.

Mr. Williams said there were provisions for landscape.

Council Member Beecham said by removing the amortization date, the City
would lose control over the site. With the changes made that evening it was
clear the uses were to remain similar to what they were.
