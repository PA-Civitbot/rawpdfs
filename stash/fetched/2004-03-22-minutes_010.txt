 Tom Kelly, 151 Waverley Street, said the solution caused discord and
 inconvenience. The trial data showed traffic calming was safer for cars,
 bicycles, and pedestrians.

 Anthony Tam, 175 Webster Street, said cut-through traffic was an issue
 and hoped the traffic calming would remain.

 Rob Williams, 644 Hawthorne Avenue, said the original mixed measures
 plan was equitable and could present a compromise.

 Jaime Segura, 654 Everett Avenue, said there were young and old
 residents in his neighborhood. Better use of resources should be used for
 traffic calming.

 RECESS: 9:00 p.m. to 9:05 p.m.

 Leslie Goldman, 110 Waverley Street, said the neighborhood was safer and
 quieter and the quality of life had improved since the traffic calming. She
 asked the Council to approve the Modified Mixed Measures Plan.

 John Woodfill, 301 Bryant Street, said the Modified Mixed Measures Plan
 was a large step from the current plan, which could present new problems.

 Roberto Medrano, 419 Hawthorne Avenue, said there were a lot of
 problems on his street prior to the traffic calming.

 Diane Belknap, 326 Hawthorne Avenue, said prior to the traffic calming,
 problems had increased with cut-through traffic on residential streets that
 were not designed to handle high volumes of traffic.

 Walter Sedriks, 325 Waverley Street, said the traffic on the cross streets in
 Downtown North had increased to the highest levels in a residential
 neighborhood.

 Marguerite Kramer, 348 Guinda Street, said traffic calming was needed,
 but the barriers were an extreme measure. Alternatives would be traffic
 circles, lights and stop signs for safer streets.

 Steve Frankel, 351 Bryant Street, said the Planning Commissionâ€™s
 recommendations should be approved.

 Sophia Dhrymes, 483 Hawthorne Avenue, spoke about the difficulty her
 renters had with the barriers.
