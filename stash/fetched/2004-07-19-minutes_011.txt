Council Member Kishimoto asked whether the timing of the initial rent
payment was taken into consideration.

Mr. Fellman said the Saffron Club anticipated opening in December and
would pay rent when they opened their doors.

Council Member Kishimoto said there was a potential difference of $320,000.

Mr. Fellman said there was no difference if their doors opened in December.

Council Member Kishimoto asked whether that was the assumption.

Mr. Fellman confirmed.

Council Member Kishimoto asked about the criteria for selection and whether
it was included in the RFP.
Mr. Fellman said the Council had set up the zoning, which allowed for eating
and drinking, personal services, retail services, and travel agencies.
Financial service providers were excluded.

Council Member Kishimoto asked whether the RFP explicitly stated the
criteria for selection.

Mr. Fellman said it had.

Mr. Yeats said the criterion was for the City to meet the obligation of the
bond financing. The tenant proposals rejected were financial services.

Council Member Kishimoto said economically the two proposals were not
that different.

Mr. Fellman said they were not that different over the ten-year period. In
the first years, there was a significant difference. The obligation to pay the
bond was $320,000 per year.

Council Member Kishimoto asked whether the staff’s intention to broadcast
only the financial criteria would exclude her ability as a Council Member to
consider other factors.

Mr. Yeats said as a Council Member she could approve staff’s
recommendation or reject all bidders and go through the process again.

Mayor Beecham asked for clarification of Mr. Yeat’s response to Council
Member Kishimoto.
