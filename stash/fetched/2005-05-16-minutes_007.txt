PUBLIC HEARING

7.   Public Hearing: Palo Alto Downtown Business Improvement District
     and Adoption of a Resolution Confirming the Report of the Advisory
     Board and Levying an Assessment for Fiscal Year 2005-2006 in
     Connection with the Downtown Palo Alto Business Improvement
     District (BID).

Stephanie Wansek, President of the Downtown Business Association,
reviewed the highlights of the Advisory Board’s accomplishments.

Marc Dickow, Chair of the Downtown Streets SubCommittee, responded to a
survey by the Business Improvement District (BID). Two important issues
were addressed; cleanliness of the streets and the unhoused population.

Vice Mayor Kleinberg queried whether the program had designer tip boxes.

Mr. Dickow confirmed. Tip jars would be located throughout the City streets.
The monies collected would channel back into the program.

Council Member Morton said involving the unhoused population gave them
an ownership interest in the downtown area.

Council Member Cordell said Springboard Forward was also working with the
Downtown Streets Committee program. The two programs working together
would set a precedent for other cities.

Mr. Dickow introduced Norm Carroll, Coordinator, Downtown Streets
Program.

Bruce Gee, 1305 Greenwood Avenue, said smaller businesses paid a highly
disproportionate amount of the BID assessment. The benefits of the BID
were skewed towards retailers and restaurants.

Stacey Yates said she was in favor of the BID. As a new business, the BID
gave her the opportunity to be more involved in the Downtown decisions,
