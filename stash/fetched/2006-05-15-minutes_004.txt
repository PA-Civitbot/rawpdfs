SPECIAL ORDERS OF THE DAY

Mayor Kleinberg acknowledged Affordable Housing Week in the City of Palo
Alto.

Marlene Prendergast, 725 Alma Street, said the Palo Alto Housing
Corporation (PAHC) had recently been inducted into the California Housing
Consortium (CHC) Hall of Fame, a state organization whose members work
to advance affordable housing and community development issues
throughout California. CHC chose to honor individuals and organizations that
had championed the cause of affordable housing in California for more than
30 years. The PAHC had also been honored with two project specific awards;
the Santa Clara County Housing Trust Fund (SCCHTF) Prometheus Award to
Alma Place for its architectural excellence in affordable housing, and two
Golden Nugget Awards to Oak Court Apartments for creativity and
achievement in architectural design and land use for homes and
developments in the Western United States.

Director of Planning and Community Environment Steve Emslie recognized
some of the major initiatives City staff had accomplished: 1) allocated $2
million to fund the Opportunity Center, which was slated to open in the
summer of 2006. It would provide 89 units of single room occupancy (SRO)
and family housing; 2) contributed $650,000 to the SCCHTF, and received
$750,000 in funding from the program; 3) allocated $1 million to the
Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funding, which was used in
April 2006 for the acquistion of Alma Apartments; 4) acquired 210 units of
Below Market Rate (BMR) housing in the housing inventory over the past few
years; 5) completed a two-year study of the BMR program, which would
come to the Council in the fall of 2006; and 6) continued working with Eden
Housing to prepare a conceptual plan for future housing on the Alma
substation site.
