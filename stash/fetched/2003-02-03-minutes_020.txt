City Manager Benest said yes. It was already included in the Utilities
Department budget in terms of Capital Improvement Projects to move the
station.

Council Member Ojakian said he assumed from reading in the staff report
(CMR:150:03) that the development of the site could add additional housing
units.

Mr. Benest said that was the assumption.

Council Member Ojakian said he did not concur with the P&TC and accepted
the Current Plan, which was the applicant’s Original Plan. He supported the
Statement of Overriding Considerations because he felt the need for
additional housing units.

MOTION: Council Member Ojakian moved, seconded by Burch, to 1) certify
the Final Environmental Impact Report, including the program for
mitigation, monitoring and reporting, based upon the findings in the
California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), as set forth in the Resolution
that is Attachment A of CMR:150:03; and 2) approve a zone change from
the existing Downtown Commercial Service with Pedestrian Overlay (CD-
S(P)) to Planned Community (PC) and grant a variance from the Palo Alto
Municipal Code, Section 18.68.150(b) to allow portions of the project within
150 feet of the Planned Community District at 901 Alma Street (PC-4389)
to extend above 35 feet, as set forth in Attachments B and “N” (Ordinance
and Resolution), including acceptance of the Statement of Overriding
Considerations for CEQA purposes.
