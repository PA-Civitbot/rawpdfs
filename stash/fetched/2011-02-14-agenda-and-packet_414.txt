                                   the opportunity to comment on the United States Environmental Protection
           PAST PRESIDENT
            Kevin L. Shafer        Agency’s (“EPA” or “Agency”) request for public comments on the Proposed

                                   (“Proposed Rule”) under § 129 of the Clean Air Act (“CAA”). NACWA represents
                                   the interests of nearly 300 of the nation’s publicly owned treatment works

                      Ken Kirk
                                   United States, including approximately half of the sewage sludge incinerators that
                                   will be affected by this rulemaking. For over 40 years, NACWA has maintained a
                                   leadership role in legal and policy issues affecting the public agencies responsible
                                   for cleaning the nation’s wastewater, and has been at the forefront of the
                                   development and implementation of scientifically-based, technically-sound and
                                   cost-effective environmental programs for protecting public and ecosystem health.

                                           EPA’s Proposed Rule, if finalized, would have a significant negative impact
                                   on the NACWA members that use incineration to responsibly manage the
                                   thousands of tons of sewage sludge generated on a daily basis from the treatment of
                                   the nation’s wastewater. Although wastewater treatment agencies rely on having
                                   multiple options for managing their sludge, the list of available options has slowly
