Vice Mayor Kleinberg said that the Cingular map would be of on-going
Cingular sites and new T-Mobile sites.

Mr. Stephens said T-Mobile assumed the responsibility of the information
presented.

Vice Mayor Kleinberg asked whether the Cingular map showed Cingular
sites. Some of the sites continued as Cingular sites, and some would be T-
Mobile sites, so they were not exactly the same in terms of need.

Mr. Stephens said all of the sites on the map were T-Mobile sites.

Vice Mayor Kleinberg asked whether T-Mobile purchased or received all
Cingular cell sites.

Mr. Stephens said yes.

Vice Mayor Kleinberg said there are no Cingular sites in the area; they were
all T-Mobile.

Mr. Stephens said they were all T-Mobile sites on the map and
the T-Mobile engineers knew better coverage was needed in the area.

William Hammett, Hammett and Edison Consulting Engineers, said the site
would comply with the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) standards,
which were designed to protect all persons for exposure to radio frequencies.

Council Member Freeman said the FCC regulations were for single towers.
She asked whether there were Federal regulations for overlapping towers.

Mr. Hammett said the FCC regulated all sources.        The cumulative levels
would comply with standards for the new tower.

Mayor Burch declared the Public Hearing closed at 9:40 p.m.

Council Member Kishimoto said staff had spoken about meeting all the
conditions.

Mr. Emslie said the Planning and Transportation Commissionâ€™s (P&TC)
motion included that all conditions should be met.

Council Member Kishimoto said she understood the conditions would be
brought into compliance.

Mr. Emslie said that was correct.
