                         TRANSCRIPT
Mayor Holman: Council Member DuBois, would you repeat that please or
have you provided it already to City Clerk?

Council Member Kniss: Is that the whole thing?

Council Member DuBois: That's the whole thing. I did send it to Clerk.

Mayor Holman: Let's give David just a moment to get it up on the screen
please.

Council Member DuBois: David, I did email it to you. I don't know if you
have it. No. I emailed it to you.

Mayor Holman: That's what he's typing from. He has to retype it at this
point in time still.

Council Member DuBois: He skipped the first part though. The very first
sentence was adopt the Ordinance with the deletion. Yeah, make a new "A."
Just delete 18.85.203(c).

Mayor Holman: Delete which one? I'm sorry.

Council Member DuBois:      18.85.203(c) self mitigating buildings as an
exemption. I think they should be part of the scoring.

Mayor Holman: For selection criteria, you were putting that off.

Council Member DuBois: Yeah. I think we should delete "E," monetary
value of public benefits. I guess I'll include it.

Mayor Holman: Now seeing the Motion essentially on the screen ...

Council Member DuBois: It's 18.85.207(e).

Mayor Holman: Now seeing this on the screen, Council Member DuBois is
looking for a second.

Council Member Burt: Second.

Mayor Holman: Council Member Burt.

MOTION: Council Member Dubois moved, seconded by Council Member
Burt to adopt the Office/R&D Annual Limit Ordinance with the following
changes:

A.   Delete Municipal     Code   Section   18.85.203(c)   â€“   Self     Mitigating
     Buildings; and
                                                                        Page 112 of 133
