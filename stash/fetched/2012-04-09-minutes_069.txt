                      DRAFT MINUTES
Mayor Yeh asked if there was a preference for an additional
Guiding Principle Number 16 around funding or finances.

Council Member Espinosa asked if there were two options on the
table, one that the language became a Guiding Principle and if
not, that it became a task.

Mayor Yeh said that was a separate question. He thought that
the CPAC members had agreed to create a draft task list from the
input which would be brought back to full Council for approval in
conjunction with the revised Guiding Principles. He said that he
was only asking if it should be a Guiding Principle. He called the
straw vote and only two Council Members voted for it to be a
Guiding Principle. He called for a straw vote about a task being
included around finances.

Council Member Espinosa said he was in favor of seeing it
explored more broadly by the PAC.

Mayor Yeh asked if there were any additional potential Guiding
Principles.

Council Member Shepherd had proposed a Guiding Principle about
how to change the Guiding Principles as the CPAC moved forward
and decisions were made. She thought that it could be simple
about how the CPAC would propose new Guiding Principles and
bring them forward to Council in their reports as the process
developed.    She said that was not the final wording, but
something to that effect.

Mayor Yeh said that “The CPAC will propose new Guiding
Principles as the process necessitates.”

Council Member Holman asked for clarification on the specific
language having to do with funding that was not recommended
because it received two votes.     She said Council Member
Espinosa mentioned that they should have a Guiding Principle
