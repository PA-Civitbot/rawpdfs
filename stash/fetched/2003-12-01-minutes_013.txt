Ms. Furth said there was a 30-day waiting period before a passed
Ordinance became law. For example, a building permit would never be
issued reliant of the Ordinance because a building permit was an
entitlement to proceed with the project. But it was not customary in
this City to stop work on a project pending the 30-days because it
served no useful purpose. When a referendum petition was filed, the
project was suspended until voters informed the City on their intent.

Council Member Lytle clarified the ARB proceeded because the
referendum occurred prior to the signatures being filed and after the
ballot qualified for the process to be stopped.

Ms. Furth said that was correct.

Council Member Burch asked what it meant by making BMR units
comparable. He was specifically interested in size.

Ms. Grote said size, materials, and location were factors that needed to
be considered. Several BMR agreements had been approved where
the units were smaller than the Market Rate Units and located on the
smaller side of the project. It did not mean they had to be exactly the
same size but, in looking at the overall size, the units should be
comparable.

Council Member Kishimoto asked if there was a BMR agreement in
place at the current time.

Mr. Emslie said there was and it would be amended to add BMR units to
the fourth floor.

Council Member Kishimoto asked whether the amendment would
change the design of the building or if units would be converted to BMR
units.

Mr. Emslie said current units would be converted to BMR units.

Council Member Kishimoto said the previous draft of the BMR
agreement, which included 54 BMR units, indicated units would be
designated on the plans approved by the City Council and the adopted
PC Ordinance. She asked whether it would create any confusion
regarding what already had been approved.

Mr. Emslie did not think so. He said the BMR agreement consisted of


12/01/03                                                         97-105
