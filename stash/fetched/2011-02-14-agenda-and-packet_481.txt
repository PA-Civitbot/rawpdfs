2.   Identification of sources and alternatives
City staff identified an alternative float switch, which is a non mercury bulb and is
produced by the same manufacturers as the mercury switches. For other applications,

such as temperature or pressure switches, there are a variety of techniques for
replacement, usually by digitizing the signal and using logic to control a switch. In
addition the RWQCP uses a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) system to make
contacts when necessary while monitoring a signal. These are usually a case-by-case
modification rather than a universal replacement. Other situations arise where the switch
is an integral part of an existing system that does not retrofit, such as the torque alarms on
the clarifier sweeps. Nothing short of redesigning the sweep arms can replace the
mercury switches; these will not be replaced.
