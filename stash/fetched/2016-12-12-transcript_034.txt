20.   Approval of: 1) a Professional Services Agreement With RMC Water
      and Environment for Development of a Recycled Water Strategic Plan
      in a Total Amount Not-to-Exceed $2,000,000; and 2) a Cost Sharing
      Agreement With the Santa Clara Valley Water District Under Which the
      District Will Fund 90 Percent of Strategic Plan Consultant Costs; and 3)
      an Amendment to the Fiscal Year 2017 Budget Appropriation for the
      Wastewater Treatment Fund.

Mayor Burt: Please vote. That passes unanimously on an 8-0 vote. Thank
you all for your comments. I hope that those who did not understand that,
one, this is not a new Item. This has been a three year process including a
commitment to the voters two years ago and subsequent Council meetings
and other public hearings on the subject. It is far from a parking garage
that would have a net increase in trips to Downtown. It is part of a three-
legged plan that will have extensive reduction in trips to Downtown. Sorry
for the misunderstandings.

MOTION PASSED: 8-0
