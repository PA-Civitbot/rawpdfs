                   other City representative as designated by the Council or its
                   committees.    Such designated person is the only individual
                   authorized to make public statements concerning the closed session.

                    It is the policy of the City Council to inform the public of action
        taken in closed session to the greatest extent possible. It is recognized, however,
        that the need for confidentiality is inherent in closed sessions and that certain
        matters if revealed may be a detriment to the results desired. The Council shall
        publicly report: (a) any decision to appoint, employ, or dismiss a public
        employee and the roll call vote thereon at its next public meeting, (b) actions
        related to litigation and the roll call vote on such actions, unless the report
        would, in the written opinion of the City Attorney for specifically stated reasons,
        clearly jeopardize the city’s ability to effectuate service of process on one or
        more unserved parties or impair the city’s ability to resolve the matter through




                                                                                                             Attachment: 2.15.11 (1422 : Policy and Services Agenda 2/15/2011)
        negotiation, mediation or other form of settlement. Notwithstanding the City
        Attorney's written opinion, the Council may under any circumstance, by
        majority vote, determine that it is in the City's best interests to disclose actions
        taken in closed session related to litigation. The public report shall be given as
        soon as possible, but no later than the next regular meeting, and shall include the
        vote or abstention of every member present. The City Attorney’s written
        opinion shall be made public, along with any action taken and any vote thereon,
        as soon as any litigation is concluded. The City Attorney shall record any action
        and vote upon such forms as the City Attorney may deem desirable.

                   e) No Minutes. No minutes of closed sessions shall be kept. The
                   City Attorney shall record the information necessary to comply with
                   state law and the Palo Alto initiative.

                   f) Confidentiality. No person in attendance at a closed session may
                   disclose the substance or effect of any matter discussed during the
                   session.viii··●●●··
