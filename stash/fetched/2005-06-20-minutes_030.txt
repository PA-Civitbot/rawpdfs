Mayor Burch said that was not his expectation; however, he hoped City staff
would be able to determine whether Federal grants were available.

Vice Mayor Kleinberg asked for a current update from the JCRC at the meeting
of July 11, 2005.

Council Member Ojakian said he had heard from Congresswoman Anna Eshoo
that Palo Alto could still get Federal grant funds for the current year. The
Airport Master Plan was slated for discussion with the County Commission in
August 2005, which would allow for information to be made available. He said
he hoped his colleagues would join in the motion to have the meeting to discuss
ideas and options for the Palo Alto Airport.

Council Member Beecham expressed support for the motion, and looked
forward to a future discussion on how the City of Palo Alto could make the best
use of the airport.

Council Member Mossar stated it was possible that nothing might be done at
the Council meeting of July 11, 2005 that gave anyone any reassurance, but
she would welcome the conversation.

MOTION PASSED 9-0.
