Council Member Scharff asked how much it would cost to buy the compost
back.

Mr. Roberts said approximately a-half-a-million dollars.

Council Member Scharff asked if the compost operations would have an
impact in opening the park.

Mr. Roberts said it was a subjective question. He said under the current
policy direction and state permit the City was required to fill the landfill and
that depended on how fast material came in. The current policy would
remain in effect unless there was a policy change.

Council Member Schmid asked whether it was possible to fill the landfill with
dirt and compost from elsewhere in meeting the state requirements.

Mr. Roberts said that would meet the volumetric requirement but would
conflict with the mandates of AB939. Land filling with dirt or compost was
not a permissible use in filling the landfill.

Council Member Schmid felt the Council should be able to vote on extensions
of the landfill beyond what was agreed on in the current contract.

Senior Assistant City Attorney, Cara Silver said in regards to the rent issue,
Council approved a schedule in 2007 which served as the basis for the rent
obligation. The projected landfill closure date was 2011 and the rent
schedule went up to 2020-21 to reflect a smoothing schedule. Council would
need to revisit the schedule adopted in 2007 if the closure date was
extended.

Council Member Schmid said he was concerned the Council was asked to
vote on equipment which was for extensive use of the land and had not been
voted on by the Council. The Refuse Fund was facing a deficit due to
expenditures such as this and taking in less money because the City was not
accepting commercial disposal rights.

Council Member Holman asked how long had the Morbark been out of
operation.

Mr. Roberts said about 6 or 8 months.

Council Member Holman asked how the City was able to stock pile and sell
compost at a profit.
