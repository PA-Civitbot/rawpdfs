Council Member Questions, Comments and Announcements

Council Member Scharff: Hillary, don't leave. My announcement relates to
you. I wanted to ask Director Gitelman if, after everything we did tonight,
are you sure when you come to Budget and Finance, you've actually asked
for enough people.

Hillary Gitelman, Planning and Community Environment Director:           Thank
you. I'll consider that when I'm well rested.

Adjournment: The meeting was adjourned at 11:46 P.M.
