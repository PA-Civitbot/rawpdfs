                         TRANSCRIPT
on this evening. Those are really better for the next time that the item
comes back; although, the two are obviously related. There's an interplay.

Council Member DuBois: I'll withdraw the Motion. On Packet Pages 389 and
390, it lists a whole bunch of policies that drive all these numbers.

SUBSTITUTE AMENDMENT WITHDRAWN BY THE MAKER

Mayor Scharff: You'll withdraw the Motion. I guess we can vote on theâ€”
wait. Let me clear the lights. If anyone wants to talk who hasn't spoken on
the Amendment, put your light on. Council Member Fine.

Council Member Fine:         Thank you, Mr. Mayor.       I'm opposed to this
Amendment for a few reasons. One, I agree with the Mayor that we need to
be realistic about our jobs numbers as informed by Staff and make this
legally defensible. I do disagree with the Mayor that we can rely on other
cities for our housing needs. That's another comment. Second, I'm a little
worried after seeing this Amendment that we're aiming for zero in a funny
way. We can solve our jobs/housing imbalance by saying zero jobs, and
why don't we? That's not on the table right now. If we ratchet all these
things back, I feel that's really diminishing Palo Alto. We do need to lead on
some of these things. Somewhat on jobs and how we do it in the right way;
somewhat on how we regulate them; somewhat on how we measure
employees per square foot; things like that. I'd like to see us lead on
housing. It doesn't seem like the original Motion does that, but this
Amendment is a ratcheting back in terms of our ambition and what we
believe we're capable of. I won't support the Amendment.

Mayor Scharff: Let's vote on the board. The Amendment fails on a 6-3 vote
with Council Members Kou, Wolbach, and Holman voting yes.

AMENDMENT FAILED: 3-6 Holman, Kou, Wolbach yes

Mayor Scharff: Are we now ready to vote on the main Motion?

Mr. Keene: Give me a nice welcome back present.

Mayor Scharff: If you want to talk more, we can talk more. I do actually
see three lights now on the main Motion. Council Member Fine.

Council Member Fine: I'm going to test something out here. I'd like to
make an Amendment that the estimated employment growth be between
Scenario 2 of 9,800 and Scenario 4, which is 15,480. I'm testing you all. I
want to see.
