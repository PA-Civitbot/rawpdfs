it's pretty simple. I hope it's straightforward.

Mayor Holman: Council Members, questions, comments, Motions? Council
Member Scharff.

Council Member Kniss: I would move approval since I will be there.

Council Member Scharff: I move approval.

Mayor Holman: Council Member Scharff actually had asked for the floor, so
I'm sorry.

Council Member Scharff: I move approval of the Staff recommendation.

Council Member Kniss: So do I.

Council Member Scharff: I'll defer to Council Member Kniss. I'll second it.

Mayor Holman: We have a Motion by Council Member Kniss to approve the
Staff recommendation, and a second by Council Member Scharff.

Scharff to authorize the Cityâ€™s voting delegate to vote on the four
Resolutions aligned with the recommendations presented in the Staff Report
to be considered at the Annual League of California Cities (LOCC) conference
to be held in San Jose, CA from September 30 to October 2, 2015.
