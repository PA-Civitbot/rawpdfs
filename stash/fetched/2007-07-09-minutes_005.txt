The Council and UAC discussed the need for staff to hold more public
workshops and to communicate with customers through vehicles such as bill
inserts, frequently asked questions posted on the website, and visits to the
media, the issues of rate increases, drought impacts on rates including any
water rationing messages, use of utilities funds, conservation programs/
efforts, and the benefits of conserving to reduce bills. More specifically,
Chair Melton noted the need to inform the public of why costs are increasing
and the purposes for which Utilities funds are used.

Council Member Kleinberg suggested the UAC consider changing its title to
the “Resources Allocation Commission” to show a focus on conservation and
support of the environment. It was also suggested that bill comparisons be
posted on the web site year-round and not just when rates are adjusted. It
was agreed that one message to consumers should be that Utilities can offer
help on how homes and businesses can save money and conserve resources.

No action required.
