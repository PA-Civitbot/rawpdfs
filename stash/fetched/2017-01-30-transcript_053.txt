Vice Mayor Kniss: I think separate from the Comp Plan Update is fine. The
reasons. Now speaking to the Motion, which will …

Mayor Scharff: It's not to maintain the current 50-foot height limit. It's to
separate it from—to not put it in the current Comp Plan …

Vice Mayor Kniss: It is not to put it in the Comp Plan, but to …

Mayor Scharff: … and keep the existing Ordinance.

Vice Mayor Kniss: … keep the 50-foot height limit that we have had now, we
agree, for about 40 years. Are we now agreed on this?

Council Member Wolbach: No (inaudible).

Vice Mayor Kniss: Let's get it right before we have a discussion.

Council Member Wolbach: I agree.

Vice Mayor Kniss: My goal is to maintain the current 50-foot height limit,
separate it from the Comp Plan Update because it is currently an Ordinance
and can continue to be an Ordinance.

Mayor Scharff: I think the simplest thing to do and the cleanest thing to do
would be just simply to say to not address height limits in the Comp Plan.

Vice Mayor Kniss: No. That isn't what I want. I want to keep the current
50-foot height limit.

Council Member Wolbach: Can I ask a question of Staff?

Mayor Scharff: Sure.

Council Member Wolbach: Is it possible for Staff to do a Control-F on the
existing Comp Plan to find the existing Comp Plan's language on height
limits? I think our goal was not to change that, whatever that is. If it's
silent, to maintain silence. If there is a current reference, to maintain that
reference.

Ms. Gitelman: We'll find it.

Vice Mayor Kniss: I don't see how this could be that complicated.

Mayor Scharff: I don't either.

Council Member Wolbach: Would the maker accept a slight Amendment?
