They increased their percent of excellent and good ratings from 81 percent
to 84 percent and of recreation centers or facilities from 75 percent to 81
percent. Generally, a slight increase in their perception of recreation and
wellness facilities and their use of them. Moving onto the next facet. We've
got a few categories within safety. The first one is police. The quality of
police services generally rates well. It's stayed the same since 2011 at 88
percent. I've got some statistics in here from the Performance Report. The
number of emergency calls increased about 14 percent, and the response
time increased about 29 percent. The number of urgent calls increased 50
percent, and the response time increased about 26 percent. The non-
emergency calls declined by about 5 percent, and the average response time
increased by about 18 percent. We do note in the Performance Report that
Palo Alto's violent crime rate compares well to other nearby cities. About 68
per 1,000 residents is lower than seven nearby cities we compared. Menlo
Park is slightly lower than Palo Alto. We compared it to Milpitas, Sunnyvale,
Santa Clara, Fremont, Mountain View, Redwood City, and San Mateo which
are all higher. Those range from slightly over 1 per 1,000 residents to about
2 1/2 per 1,000 residents. Moving onto fire. The survey respondents'
responses for fire services have increased over time, about 5 percentage
points for fire services, 3 percentage points for ambulance or emergency
medical services, and 9 percentage points for fire prevention and education.
In the Performance Report you'll see that the number of medical and rescue
calls increased 18 percent, and the average response time increased about
19 percent. All other calls increased from 3,000 to about 3,500, so about a
17 percent increase there. I can break down these numbers for you. Jim is
asking me to mention what these numbers are. We can go to â€¦

James Keene, City Manager: Just since there's a grouping there of fire and
false alarms, for example (crosstalk).

Ms. Richardson: They're on Page 40 of the Performance Report. The false
alarm calls increased from 1,005 to 1,046. Fire calls actually declined from
165 to 150. General service calls increased from 406 to 541. Hazardous
condition calls remained pretty consistent at 182 down to 180. Moving onto
emergency operations.      The citizen ratings in the Citizens Survey as
excellent and good increased about 5 percentage points for emergency
preparedness services. Where you really see a huge increase in emergency
operations is in the work that we do to educate the public on emergency
preparedness. You see the number of presentations, training sessions.
Those also include City employees and exercises. This is a 516 percent
increase from 38 in 2012, the first year we collected data for this, to 234 in
2016.    The number of EOC activations and deployments increased 70
percent, from 27 to 46. Moving onto Animal Services. Residents continue to
see continued improvement in their perception of animal control services.
