Public hearing opened and closed with no speakers at 11:38 p.m.

Vice Mayor Morton inquired whether the Agenda Item was to create six “for
sale” condominium units, which would provide ownership to multiple
purchasers.

Mr. Williams stated that was correct. Because the application is a request to
create more than four condominium units, this request cannot be processed
administratively, and therefore, required review and recommendation by the
P&TC and approval by the City Council.

Vice Mayor Morton asked whether the building was able to revert back, if
one individual wanted to purchase the entire building. He inquired whether
the same process would apply.

Mr. Williams stated one individual could potentially own all six condominium
units within the building. He stated the condominium units could be merged
back together.

MOTION:     Vice Mayor Morton moved, seconded by Council Member
Kishimoto to approve the Tentative Map to create six (6) commercial
condominium units within an existing office building at 164 Hamilton Avenue
based on the findings and conditions stated in the draft Record of Land Use
Action.

Council Member Schmid asked for clarification on the location of 164
Hamilton Avenue.

Mayor Drekmeier stated the parcel was west of Casa Olga.

Mr. Williams stated Agenda Item Nos. 17 and 18 did not change the zoning
for 164 Hamilton Avenue and it would remain CD-C (P).

MOTION PASSED: 8-0 Barton absent
