STUDY SESSION

1.    Potential List of Topics for the Study Session with Santa Clara County
      Supervisor Joe Simitian.

Mallary Alcheck requested the parking reduction on Stanford Avenue be
reevaluated. Reducing parking would limit use of and access to the Dish.

Jeannie Meyer stated use of the gate at Stanford Avenue resulted in
increased traffic, noise, pollution and nuisance activities. Parking at Coyote
Hill Road would not have the detrimental impact of Stanford Avenue parking.
She requested the Council approve the proposed compromise.

Aram James invited the Council and Supervisor Simitian to attend the Stop
the Ban meeting scheduled for November 9, 2013. A safe parking program
could mitigate the effects of the Vehicle Habitation Ordinance.

Roland Lebrun indicated that Supervisor Simitian developed the concept of a
blended system. The issue was the lack of leadership to bring the blended
system forward. He requested Supervisor Simitian consider joining the
Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority and subsequently the Caltrain
Board to advance the blended system.

Ruth Lowy stated moving parking away from the Dish was shortsighted.
She suggested a portable toilet and signage be placed by the entry gate.
