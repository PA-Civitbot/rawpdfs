                   rescheduled as follows. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to
                   supersede or conflict with state law.

                          (1) Meeting adjourned sine die. When a regular meeting is
                          adjourned sine die (without a day), all unfinished items will
                          be listed under unfinished business on the next regular
                          Council meeting agenda; except, that where deemed
                          necessary, the City Clerk, with the City Manager's
                          concurrence, may place those business items in a different
                          order on the agenda.

                          (2) Meeting adjourned to date certain. When a regular
                          meeting is adjourned to another regular meeting night, all
                          unfinished items will be listed in their original order after roll




                                                                                                             Attachment: 2.15.11 (1422 : Policy and Services Agenda 2/15/2011)
                          call on the agenda of such designated regular meeting.

                          (3) Continued items. When an item on the agenda is
                          continued to a subsequent meeting, such item will be listed
                          under unfinished business on such agenda unless the Council
                          by majority vote chooses to place such item in a different
                          location on such agenda or unless the City Clerk, with the
                          City Manager's concurrence, deems it necessary to place such
                          item at a different location on such agenda.

                   e) Adding New Items to the Agenda. No matters other than those
                   on the agenda shall be finally acted upon by the Council. However,
                   emergency actions (as defined in Government Code section 54956.5)
                   and matters upon which there is a lawful need to take immediate
                   action (as defined in Government Code section 54954.2) may, with
                   the consent of two-thirds, or all members present if less than two-
                   thirds are present, be considered and acted upon by the Council.

           2. Special Meetings. Special meetings may be called by the Mayor or City
           Council by providing a minimum of 24-hours posted notice in the manner
           required by state law. To the greatest extent possible, special meetings
           called for other than regular meeting days should be scheduled by a
           majority of the Council present and voting at a regular meeting.vi Unlike
           regular meetings, there are no circumstances that permit the City Council to
           add new items to a special meeting agenda or notice.

            3. Study Sessions. Study sessions are meetings during which the Council
            receives information about City business in an informal setting.

                   a) Time. Special study sessions will be held as needed.
