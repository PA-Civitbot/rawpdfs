Ms. Berkoff stated there would be many questions that were needed to be
asked regarding peek times, peek seasons, and how many people were
being turned away.

Mayor Kishimoto asked whether that would have to do with the surge
capacity that they wanted to build as well.

Ms. Berkoff stated there were surge for peeks. There could also be major
disaster situations where there would be temporary setups for people.

Mayor Kishimoto asked whether this issue also had to do with the regional
network.

Ms. Berkoff stated that was correct.

Mayor Kishimoto asked whether they would also be looking at the increase in
medical care costs.

Ms. Berkoff stated there were two parts of hospital costs: 1) the construction
costs, which were a one-time cost and; 2) the operating costs, which were
an everyday cost.

Council Member Morton asked whether statistics would be looked at
regarding local usage, regional usage, out of area usage and turn aways.

Ms. Berkoff stated she had not seen the data. However, this would be done
by use of zip codes, which were used by the patients.

Council Member Morton asked whether it was a usage pattern based on zip
codes.

Ms. Berkoff stated he was correct. It was a complex utilization analysis
based on zip code, admittance, diseases, or reasons.

Council Member Beecham added that this was odd for the Council to get a
document like this. This was a guidance document to help provide an
overview and context for what was happening with this project.

MOTION: Council Member Beecham moved, seconded by Morton, to accept
the draft update of the Stanford University Medical Center (SUMC) Area Plan
along with Attachment A and suggested modifications by Planning and
Transportation Commissioner Arthur Keller.

Council Member Beecham stated this would provide adequate background
for the project.
