was requested. The tenant still uses that primarily as wholesale. They have
done some minor retail sales out of there. We were not totally aware of
that. I still don't know exactly what the percentage is, but it's been
primarily warehouse. If you see the photographs, you can see that it's
warehouse. I do not see how a tenant improvement application would be
allowed to be submitted to the City when the parking requirement cannot be
met. If this was designated as retail, again it would have 34 parking spaces.
Because of the current interpretation of the Staff that we are a retail-like
use, we have been actively marketing the property as retail since Pet Food
Depot is moving out. We've been unable to lease it. We request that the
propertyâ€”is this red light on?

Mayor Burt: You're all done, yeah.

Mr. Smith: We request that the property not be clouded by the Retail
Ordinance, that the practical use of this property be maintained and it stay

Mayor Burt: Thank you. Our next speaker is Heather Young, to be followed

Heather Young: Good evening. My name is Heather Young. I'm an

and diversifying the City's economic base. The Ordinance in place has begun
to address these goals. It's clearly written to prevent office uses from
moving into ground-floor locations while encouraging and fostering a broad
diversity of retail and retail-like uses that vitalize our streets and storefronts.
As you discuss the Interim Retail Preservation Ordinance, please consider
strengthening the ordinance by expanding the definition of retail use to

retail Ordinance already allows daycare, shouldn't small-scale private
education like the AltSchool be allowed? The people you envision supporting
retail uses are the same people who will be supported by and enrolled in
