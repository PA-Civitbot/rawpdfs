Mayor Klein asked what questions we had to judge the effectiveness of
outreach to our citizens.

Ms. Erickson stated there was some data in     this report that may be valuable
to that effort and there may be more            specific detailed and discreet
information that would be helpful in trying    to measure the effectiveness of
whatever effort that the City and others put   together.

Mayor Klein asked to add how much our citizens are using our website as a
question to the survey.

Ms. Erickson stated that we already had that information. 62 percent of
citizens used the internet to connect businesses with the City.

Mayor Klein stated that his question was how many people find out
information about the City from our website and he asked whether we could
put information into the utility mailers.

Ms. Erickson stated anything could be done for a price and it could be
discussed with the consultant whether it could be done at all.

Council Member Morton asked what the non-commute traffic was in regards
to the Greenhouse Gas Emissions.

Ms. Erickson stated it would be other people in our community and primarily
us running errands like shopping and driving kids to school.

Council Member Morton clarified that we have ten times as much personal
driving as we do commuting to Palo Alto.

Ms. Erickson stated these were baseline numbers. The Green Ribbon
Taskforce was working on these numbers and we agreed to put these
estimates in the report because they were baseline. They wanted to have
another forum in which to continue to report on these numbers. These
estimates were subject to change.

Mayor Klein thanked Sharon for a job well done and noted this report could
be used as a tool to move through the rest of the year.
