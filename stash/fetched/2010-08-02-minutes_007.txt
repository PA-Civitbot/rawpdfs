Council Member Scharff stated in order to accurately vote on the Grand Jury
report, the Grand Jury response should be discussed after the Binding
Arbitration discussion, Agenda Item No. 20.

Mayor Burt stated it had been determined in that the appropriate sequence
of the Agenda Items was to discuss the policy issue, Agenda Item No. 17,
then move into the specific actions relating to Binding Arbitration.

Council Member Klein stated the Grand Jury response included Binding
Arbitration and therefore to hear about the matter prior to a full discussion
on it would be out of order.

Mayor Burt clarified Agenda Item No. 20 was specific to whether or not there
would be a measure placed on the ballot this fall.

Council Member Klein stated the action taken was important and the position
taken by Council needed to be addressed in the Grand Jury response.

MOTION PASSED: 8-1 Burt no
