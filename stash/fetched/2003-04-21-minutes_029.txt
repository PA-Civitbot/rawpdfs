AGENDA CHANGES, ADDITIONS, AND DELETIONS

MOTION: Council Member Morton moved, seconded by Beecham, to
continue Item No. 18 re 706-708 Los Trancos Road to the May 5, 2003,
regular City Council meeting.

MOTION PASSED 9-0.

Mayor Mossar entertained a motion to move the three Closed Session items
forward to become 18A, 18B, and 18C. The reason for doing so was there
were items to be discussed in closed session that may have an impact on
Item No. 19.

Council Member Morton asked whether Oral Communications could be taken
before the vote so the public would not have to wait and speak after the
Closed Session.

Council Member Lytle said because the Closed Session items were going to
be taken before Item No. 19, which dealt with the Roth building and the
Roth building Budget Amendment Ordinance (BAO) was also part of Item
No. 17, she asked whether the Closed Session items would be discussed
before Item No. 17.

Mayor Mossar said it was not part of Item No. 17.

Council Member Lytle asked whether it could become part of Item No. 17.

Mayor Mossar replied no.

Council Member Lytle asked whether it could become part of the mid-year
BAO.
