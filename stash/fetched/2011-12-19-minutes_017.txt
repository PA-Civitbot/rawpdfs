accepted those findings and conclusions, and understood the report
represented the best analysis of the facts at that time. Acceptance made
the report a document of the City Council. He thought it was a fairly
significant action.

Council Member Scharff inquired whether this was the final report.

Mr. Emslie suggested Staff would utilize the Council's comments and
concerns in discussions with the consultant to modify the draft report. He
also suggested the report would benefit from further review by the Rail
Committee before returning to the Council.

Council Member Scharff asked if there was a budget for this report.

Mr. Emslie responded yes.

Council Member Scharff inquired whether the City would spend more money
on the report.

Mr. Emslie answered yes.

Council Member Scharff asked for the cost of this additional work.

Mr. Emslie estimated $10,000 or less.

Council Member Holman inquired whether not accepting the report meant
the Council should expend more funds to redraft the report or whether not
accepting the report indicated the report had not provided adequate
information for an informed decision. She asked if Staff wanted a motion to
send the report to the Rail Committee for review.

Mr. Emslie stated Staff had collected Council comments, and suggested the
Council could vote to send the report to committee subject to addressing
comments; or Staff could take that as general direction as well.

Vice Mayor Yeh suggested the motion include a cap of $10,000 for additional
related expenses.

MOTION: Council Member Holman moved, seconded by Vice Mayor Yeh
that Staff take comments from the City Council and fold it into the analysis
reports to be forwarded to the Rail Committee for their review and
recommendation to Council; furthermore to provide a cap of $10,000 for
continued work on the reports.
