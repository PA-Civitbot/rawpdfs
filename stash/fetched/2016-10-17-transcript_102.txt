Mr. Lait: I think we'll make a definition.      We'll just add a definition, yoga
studio or something.

Vice Mayor Scharff: A definition for yoga studios and martial arts and that
kind of stuff.

Council Member Wolbach: I've been thinking yoga studio, dance, barre,

Mr. Lait: We can come up—rather than try to figure it out now, I think we're
hearing the message. Is it not on University or is it not in the GF?

Vice Mayor Scharff: It's in the entire GF ...

Council Member Wolbach: Outside of University.

Vice Mayor Scharff: ... outside of University Avenue.

Mr. Lait: Thank you.

Mayor Burt: It's what you already have in that one bullet 3. It says greater

Council Member Kniss: That's true, Pat.

since we're doing this. At the corner of Ramona and University, for some
reason that's not in the GF, ground-floor protection. Is that because that's a
PC?
