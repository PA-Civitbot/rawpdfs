Mr. Benest stated the Council would need to make a clear decision. He
stated there would be a contract coming in May for Mitchell Park Library and
Community Center Design, and one for the Education Outreach Effort.

MOTION: Vice Mayor Klein moved, seconded by Barton, to direct staff to
move forward on both the Library and Community Center and the Public
Safety Building projects.

MOTION PASSED 9-0.

MOTION: Mayor Kishimoto moved to direct staff to come back with a Plan B
for Certificates of Participation (COP) for the Public Safety Building.

Council Member Cordell asked staff whether developing Plan B would take an
unusual amount of time.

Mr. Yeats replied staff would meet with the Bond Counsel and financial
advisors. He would need to discuss the process and figure out the collateral
for the COP and determine the structure and the debt services costs.

Mr. Benest added the issue is how to free up an additional $3.9 million
dollars per year for the next 30 years or find another tax revenue source.

Mayor Kishimoto stated this would be something the staff would have to face
if the Public Safety Building measure failed.

Council Member Mossar stated the Public Safety Building provides a core
service and it must be funded.

Council Member Barton asked whether this would go in June or November
2008.

MOTION FAILED FOR LACK OF A SECOND.

MOTION: Council Member Barton moved, seconded by Kleinberg, to leave
open the possibility of a June 2008 ballot.

MOTION PASSED 9-0.
