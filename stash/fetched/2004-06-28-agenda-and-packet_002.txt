Even with these accomplishments, we have had no way to comprehensively
quantify the funds needed for ongoing support of our infrastructure during our
budget discussions.

Private corporations use a somewhat different set of accounting standards than
local governments. Corporations must record depreciation of assets and deduct
that amount from revenues in order to calculate their bottom line. Financial
institutions and investors demand this in order to accurately determine whether
the corporation is genuinely balancing its books.

Recent GASB 34 standards specify for the first time that we calculate
depreciation of all our assets including infrastructure. The statement of activities
in the City’s Comprehensive Annual Financial Report includes this depreciation
expense. In addition, our new SAP software can track the value of our assets
over time. This tool provides the opportunity to evaluate revenues, expenses
and transfers to our capital fund so as to better understand whether our
Operating Budget is balanced once depreciation is factored in.

In discussions with staff, relevant issues need to be defined and understood in
order to present in our next Operating Budget a full assessment of depreciation.

We ask for our colleagues’ support of this recommendation in order to give us a
better understanding of how our assets and infrastructure are consumed and
how to adequately fund their renewal.
