Mayor Drekmeier stated when the report was done Staff was aware of the
projects.

Ms. Ratchye stated the 2005 report was completed in 2004 and at the time
the impending projects had not come to be.

Mayor Drekmeier clarified the figures given to the San Francisco Public
Utilities Commission (SFPUC) did not include the projects usage numbers.

Ms. Ratchye stated that was correct.

Mayor Drekmeier asked whether the same assurances would be received
upon the completion of the new contract between Bay Area Water Supply
and Conservation Agency (BAWSCA) and the SFPUC.

Ms. Ratchye stated the supply assurance in perpetuity did not change in the
contract.

Mayor Drekmeier asked whether the new contract would require payment to
maintain the unused assurances.

Ms. Ratchye stated currently the payment was charged at a volumetric rate.

Mayor Drekmeier asked whether the groundwater pumped was potable.

Ms. Ratchye stated the City did not pump groundwater.

Mayor Drekmeier asked whether Stanfordâ€™s groundwater pumping for
irrigation was from the low level aquifer.

Ms. Ratchye stated yes.

Mayor Drekmeier asked why Phase III of the pipeline was routed up San
Antonio Road.

Ms. Ratchye stated the transfer route from Highway 101 was near San
Antonio Road and curved down Colorado Road. She stated the proposed
route gave the ability to connect to multiple parks.

Mayor Drekmeier asked whether the City had previously identified the high
water users either business or individual and strongly encouraged audits.

Ms. Ratchye stated she was unaware of an identification program.
