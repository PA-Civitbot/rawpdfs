Mr. Emslie said all spot traffic calming treatment projects were done on a
trial basis and were modified and removed. Removal of speed tables were
easy and not an extraordinary expense.

Council Member Freeman asked if speed tables would not be permanent until

Mr. Emslie said there were multiple steps that would need to take place prior

Council Member Freeman said she was concerned about the timing.

should the new developer ask for a new PC development.

Mr. Emslie said no.

Council Member Kleinberg asked if the primary motivation and guiding
principle of the study and the motion was the traffic analysis was done to
