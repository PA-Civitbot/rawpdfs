Council Member Kishimoto asked whether the fee needed to be passed by
the Council.

Ms. Barnes stated the fee was adopted by the individual city then the hotelsâ€™
paid into the Tourist Business Improvement District.

Council Member Kishimoto asked how long San Mateo County had been
collecting the tourist fee.

Ms. Le Clair stated approximately nine years.

Mr. Keene noted Tucson, Arizona had a similar program and collected a
tourist fee.

Council Member Kishimoto asked whether the future goal was to have the
two-year program with the hope the hotel industry would find the program
helpful.

Mr. Williams stated Destination Palo Alto was a two-year program, and at
that point it would be re-evaluated.

Council Member Kishimoto asked the process in connecting with large
employee based companies in scheduling rooms or events.

Ms. Le Clair stated the hotel industry had their own sales team to contact
corporate facilities to schedule events. She stated the corporate accounts
contacted were from out of the area.

Council Member Schmid stated the current recession created an improbable
time to increase metrics with luxury or leisure expenditures.

Carla Cumpston, Palo Alto Chamber of Commerce, stated the sales process
varied greatly and true long-term results would not always be easily or
accurately measured in a short time period.

Paula Sandas, Palo Alto Chamber of Commerce, encouraged Council to
extend the agreement with the Bureau. She stated when Council made the
choice to invest in the Bureau, it was a smart investment in the economic
future of Palo Alto.

Robert Moss, 4010 Orme, stated the concept of Destination Palo Alto was
good; unfortunately the economy was not conducive to tourism.
