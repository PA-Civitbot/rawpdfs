Vice Mayor Beecham asked what impact would there be if funding for the
Clara-Mateo Kitchen Rehabilitation were cut from $200,000 to $140,000, as
recommended by the Finance Committee.

Mr. Mullen said it was a business-case item that justified spending a larger
amount of money on the front end, deferring future dollars, and the ability
to fund other projects that amounted to smaller amounts of money.

Mayor Mossar declared the Public Hearing closed at 8:42 p.m. She said it
was the sixth year she and Council Member Ojakian had done CDBG.
Typically recommendations would come forward to the Finance Committee
and staff would recommend one thing and the CAC would recommend
another. The Finance Committee would mediate the decision and then take it
to the full Council. The CAC and staff were in agreement with their
recommendations, while the Finance Committee had gone in another
direction. There was no ability to pull money from some other place to make
the funds available.

MOTION: Council Member Morton moved, seconded by Freeman, that the
Finance Committee recommend to the City Council approval of the following:

      Allocate CDBG funding as recommended by staff in the final 2003-
       2004 Action Plan update to the Consolidated Plan for the period
       2000 to 2005.
      Commit future CDBG funds to repay the General Fund for a portion
       of the CDBG-eligible site acquisition costs in connection with a new
       affordable housing project, if a site can be identified and acquired in
       2003-2004.
      Authorize staff to submit the 2003-2004 Action Plan to the
       Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) by the May
       15, 2003 deadline.
      Authorize the City Manager, on behalf of the City, to execute the
       2003-2004 application and Action Plan for CDBG funds and any
       other necessary documents concerning the application, and to
       otherwise bind the City with respect to the application and
       commitment of funds.
      Allocate Fiscal Year 2004-2005 funding as recommended.

Further, the following changes be incorporated into the recommendation:

      Decrease by $60,000 the funding in FY 2003-2004 to the Clara-
        Mateo Alliance for the kitchen and Elsa Segovia security
        rehabilitation
      Provide $30,000 for Community Housing Incorporates Lytton
        Gardens kitchen renovation in Fiscal Year 2003-04
      Provide $30,000 to Palo Alto Housing Corporation (PAHC) for the
        Barker Hotel Improvement Plan in FY 2003-2004.
05/12/03                                                        96-28
