to the City; it was exchanging dollars. He urged his colleagues to
support the provision.

Vice Mayor Kleinberg did not support the amendment for the following
economic and financial reasons: 1) it created a precedence of making
the same offer to other CAOs; 2) bad timing when employees’
livelihoods were at stake; 3) projected a mixed message to public; and
4) leveraged investments for future executives.

Council Member Cordell echoed Vice Mayor Kleinberg’s concerns and
agreed with Ms. Carlstead’s comments. She said she was supportive of
the City Manager’s family but it would not be in the best interest of the
City to adopt the recommendation.

Mayor Burch asked what percentage the loan represented of the total
investment portfolio.

Council Member Morton said it was less than a third of 1 percent.

Council Member Freeman echoed Vice Mayor Kleinberg and Council
Member Cordell’s comments. She asked what the ramifications were
on total compensations based on City paying the taxes.

Council Member Mossar said it was included in total compensation and
defined as the sum total of salary plus all benefits.

Council Member Freeman asked how the City Manager benefited by
the $10,000 in taxes being paid by the City and deducted from his
salary.

Council Member Morton said it did not impact the City budget.

Council Member Freeman said she had several questions that were left
unanswered and would not support the motion.

Council Member Beecham said in terms of the City’s financial situation
and budget issues, the recommendations were cost-neutral and
calculated to have no impact on the budget.

Council Member Ojakian said by the City paying the     $10,000 in taxes
and the City Manager’s salary reduced by the same      amount, the City
would save money in the long-term. The base-pay        would be less in
subsequent years and the increases would be             against smaller
amounts.
