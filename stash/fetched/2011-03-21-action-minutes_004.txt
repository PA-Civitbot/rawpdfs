COUNCIL MEMBER QUESTIONS, COMMENTS, AND ANNOUNCEMENTS

City Council Member Shepherd inquired if the parking study would include
other impacted neighborhoods.

Curtis Williams, Director of Planning and Community Environment,
responded that the parking study that the City Manager referred to will
include California Avenue, south of downtown area. The 6th month analysis
will look at areas around downtown, and it will include permit parking
programs, and additional parking areas.

City Council Member Holman asked if the study will also look at the South of
Palo Alto Area (SOFA).

Mr. Williams answered yes.

Council Member Holman asked about a meeting she thought took place this
past week where the topic centered around AT&T cell site and related issues.

Mr. Williams stated it was an internal staff meeting.

Council Member Klein reported on attending the Bay Area Water Supply &
Conservation Agency (BAWSCA) last week and it was reported that the
precipitation in the Hetch Hetchy catch basin is 159% of normal as of last
week. The audit with the City of San Francisco has been resolved for Fiscal
Year 2007/08 and we received a $120,000 credit. BAWSCA budget for Fiscal
Year 2011/12 will show no increase in staff which means our contribution
will be flat.

Mayor Espinosa advised that the City continues to monitor the water levels
in the city creeks. He also spoke about the Youth Community Services
(YCS) organization and the 8th annual Family Service Day that will occur on
April 2, 2011.

ADJOURNMENT: The meeting was adjourned at 11:37 p.m.
