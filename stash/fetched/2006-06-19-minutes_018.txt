to ask the County to live up to the terms of the lease and be reasonable with
its request regarding tie-down fees.

Vice Mayor Kishimoto clarified the motion included accepting the report.

Council Member Klein said that was correct.

Council Member Klein recommended that the last sentence in item 3 of the
motion be deleted.

Council Member Morton agreed.

MOTION PASSED 9-0.

MOTION:      Vice Mayor Kishimoto moved, seconded by Drekmeier, to
authorize the City Manager to have staff return with a recommended
timeline and process to develop a post-2017 plan for the Airport.

Council Member Barton questioned whether the City needed to prepare a
timeline for beyond 2017 when there were other things before the Council.

Mayor Kleinberg asked whether Vice Mayor Kishimoto intended to state a
deadline.

Vice Mayor Kishimoto said she did not ask for a date.

Mr. Benest said the Council had an enormous agenda of priority items in the
current yearâ€™s work plan. The Council had not suggested a time, but he did
not want to misrepresent the fact that staff would not move on the item in
the near term.

Vice Mayor Kishimoto said her motion was that staff returns with a
recommended timeline and process.

Mr. Benest said he did not believe the County was submitting a grant
application for the Palo Alto Airport in the coming year.

Ms. Erickson said her understanding was the County had only minor capital
projects proposed during the next few years.

Vice Mayor Kishimoto said the intent of her motion was to have the Council
know that someone was thinking about a timeline for developing a plan.
