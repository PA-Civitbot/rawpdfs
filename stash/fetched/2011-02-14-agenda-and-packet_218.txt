The roadway capacity of California Avenue under the current 4-lane condition is approximately
1,360 vehicles per hour per direction or 680 vehicles per lane. The TIA measured the existing
Roadway Segment LOS of California Avenue under current (4-lane) and project (2-lane)

conditions but assumed a conservative 560 vehicles per lane capacity under project conditions to
account for vehicles backing into and out of parking stalls. The reduction in capacity helps to
account for "side traffic friction" and is an industry practice in the measurement of Roadway
Segment LOS.

The Roadway Segment LOS findings are provided in Table 4 and show that the 4-lane to 2-lane
reduction on California Avenue between El Camino Real and the Park Blvd Plaza would result
in a Less Than Significant impact to the street; each of the roadway segments would operate at
LOS B or better. This is expected because even under project conditions (2-lanes), the
directional capacity of the roadway is still twice as great as the vehicle demand of the street.
