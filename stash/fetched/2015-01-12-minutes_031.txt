INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER that prehearing statements are to be submitted
21 days in advance of the appeal hearing date.

Council Member Wolbach inquired whether the hearing should be announced
well in advance of 21 days prior to the hearing date to allow the parties to
properly prepare.
Ms. Stump advised that did not need to be included in the Motion.       Staff
would select a date in the next few weeks and provide notice.

Council Member Wolbach asked if Council Members could ask questions
during the hearing.

Ms. Stump responded yes. The Council should ask questions.

Council Member Wolbach was skeptical about the proposed time allotments.

Mayor Holman read the Motion as amended.

MOTION AS AMENDED PASSED: 9-0

Council took a break from 10:35 P.M. to 10:49 P.M.

13.   Authorization for the Mayor to Sign a Letter Commenting on the Draft
      Environmental Impact Report/Environmental Assessment (DEIR) for
      the Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) Bus Rapid Transit.

Jaime Rodriguez, Chief Transportation Official, advised that the Council
Packet contained a detailed letter of Staff's concerns. Comments to Santa
Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) were due January 14, 2015.

MOTION: Council Member Scharff moved, seconded by Council Member
Kniss to authorize the Mayor to sign the letter providing comments on Valley
Transportation Authority’s (VTA’s) El Camino Real Bus Rapid Transit Project
Draft Environmental Impact Report/Environmental Assessment (DEIR).

Council Member Scharff indicated the letter was comprehensive.

James Keene, City Manager, noted the comment letter was due in two days.
Robert Moss agreed with the City's opposition to dedicated bus lanes.
Reducing El Camino Real to two lanes would significantly impact traffic on El
Camino Real and cross streets.
