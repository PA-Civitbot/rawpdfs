Council Member Price asked when the Council would receive the Cost of
Service Study.

Mr. Perez expected Staff would receive the first draft in two weeks. Staff
would need to review that, create an understandable format, and determine
how to present it.

Council Member Price inquired if the Cost of Service Study was on a parallel
path and not related to the Proposed Budget.

Mr. Perez understood the urgency to move it forward, and it was a high
priority.

Council Member Burt recalled the City had extensive polling around the
Public Safety Building and the Library three or four years ago.
Unfortunately, the Public Safety Building proved to be a difficult sale for a
super majority vote. He suggested Staff provide that data to the Council.

Council Member Price assumed the current discussions would include a note
that past Public Safety Building scenarios included three-part funding.

Council Member Holman felt the information requested would help the
Council prioritize projects.

ADJOURNMENT: The meeting was adjourned at 8:45 P.M.
