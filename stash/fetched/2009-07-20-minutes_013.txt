author the argument in favor of the measure, 3) Authorize submittal of
rebuttal arguments, and 4) Approve the revised rate structure that includes
exemptions for all non-profit organizations.

Council Member Schmid said the City had diversified the tax base and noted
the importance of adding a BLT. Palo Alto was the only community in the
Bay Area without a BLT. He said the tax was 3 percent of the total General
Fund’s income. He urged the Council to support the Motion.

Council Member Kishimoto asked whether Staff was going to return with the
issue regarding hobby and the potential over-lap with occupancy tax.

Mr. Perez said it was noted in Staff Report CMR:319:09, that if the BLT
passed the Election, Staff would return with the next year’s budget with a
recommendation to reduce or eliminate the occupancy fee permit.

Ms. Silver said the hobby issue could be addressed              through   an
administrative guideline and added to the Ordinance.

Council Member Kishimoto asked what percentage were home-based
businesses.

Mr. Perez said due to lack of data he was not able to provide that
information. He said Legal’s advice was, if the Council so desired, home-
based businesses could be exempt.

Council Member Kishimoto asked what amount could the City expected from
home-based businesses.

Mr. Perez said sufficient data had not been obtained to estimate the amount.

AMENDMENT: Council Member Kishimoto moved, seconded by Council
Member XXXX to exempt home based businesses.

Vice Mayor Morton said Palo Alto was a consulting community and felt the
$75 minimum fee was not unreasonable and home-based businesses should
not be exempt. He did not support the Amendment.

Council Member Schmid said according to the American Community Survey
done by the Census Bureau, there were 5,000 self-employed people in Palo
Alto.

AMENDMENT FAILED DUE TO LACK OF A SECOND
