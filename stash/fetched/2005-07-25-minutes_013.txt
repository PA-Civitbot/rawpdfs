Vice Mayor Kleinberg said there was another district in the pipeline and staff
had asked the Council to include all others as well.

Council Member Freeman asked for clarification of the substitute motion.

Mayor Burch said the substitute motion was to have the matter return to the
Council in late September, early October with financing options.

Council Member Freeman asked how many districts were in the pipeline
between now and the end of September.

Ms. Harrison said there was one district already approved and set to be
awarded a contract.

Council Member Freeman expressed support for the substitute motion. She
said the reason some items went to committees was to vet ideas and allow
people to speak about them.

Council Member Kishimoto expressed opposition to the substitute motion.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION PASSED: 5-4, Cordell, Kishimoto, Kleinberg, Mossar
