Ms. Silver replied yes.

Vice Mayor Shepherd appreciated the improvements to the shopping center
and an adjacent property. Determining a payment for demolition of the
building was complicated.   She was concerned about the method for
calculating the payment.

Council Member Berman did not doubt the applicant's statement that the
original materials in Building Number 1 needed to be replaced with new
materials. However, the City could not confirm that statement, because the
building was demolished. He preferred the amount of any future payment
remain within the Council's discretion.

MOTION PASSED: 7-1 Holman no, Scharff absent

13.   Recommendation for One-Time Additional Allocation in the Amount of
      $250,000 Over Two Years in Support of Intensive Case Management in
      Connection with Housing Subsidies to be Provided by the County of

additional expenditures for homeless services. The Committee discussed
approaches to address homeless issues Citywide with special consideration

Committee recommended that the full Council consider an investment in the
creation of a multi-agency homeless outreach program not to exceed
$250,000, and requested Staff return with a specific plan to address the
issue. Staff worked with the Homeless Services Task Force and the County
to present a recommendation for the Council's consideration. The County
would provide housing funds to assist individuals who had contact with the
criminal justice system, had a high chance of recidivism, significantly
impacted County, State or local resources and were currently homeless or at
