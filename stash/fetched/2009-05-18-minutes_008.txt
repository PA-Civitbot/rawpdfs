gone through and the process the Committee went through to accomplish
the changes.

category one was achievable without additional funding, category two
required time and research for design, category three required additional
discussion, time, and needed more involvement. He stated Staff would be
returning to Council with recommendations on accomplishments later in the

for questions and concerns.
