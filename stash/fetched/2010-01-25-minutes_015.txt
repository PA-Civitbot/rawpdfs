Mr. Emslie stated there had not been a contractual agreement entered into
although Staff had consulted with firms with prior experience on such
matters.

Council Member Yeh asked whether the HSR Authority had released a
relative weighting on what was determined as most important when
considering the alternatives. Attachment D clarified the areas of
consideration to be:
       1. Land Use
       2. Planning Support
       3. Constructability
       4. Neighborhood Compatibility
       5. Protection of Environmental Resources and Natural Environment

Mr. Emslie stated the HRS Authority had not considered relative priority. The
(PCC) and subcommittee had communicated the concern to the HSR.

Council Member Yeh asked whether the HSR Authority had been working
with the local jurisdictions to gather the information for the alternative
analysis and if so, how would they not be aware of the priority for those
jurisdictions.

Mr. Emslie stated there had been contact prior to the start of the
alternatives analysis at a minimal level.

Sara Armstrong, CMRD, 4118 Park Boulevard, stated support for the
Lobbyist in Sacramento to advocate for the City. She stated it was important
for Palo Alto to have input with the HSR moving forward.
