MOTION RECAPPED: Vice Mayor Shepherd moved, seconded by Council
Member Klein to; 1) direct Staff to explore additional pension legislation with
our Legislators and other parties (such as the League of California Cities) to
close remaining loopholes and to give cities broader decision making power
in regards to their pension plans, and 2) to continue to work with City
employees and the public to fully understand the facts about pensions and
the status of the City’s efforts to manage costs and provision of benefits
while maintaining a talented work force, and 3) to direct Staff to write
CalPERS to confirm our understanding of how regulations will apply to Palo
Alto regarding the definition of income and advise CalPERS of our opposition
to their present interpretation as we understand it, and to send copies of our
correspondence to Legislators. Staff is directed to return to Council on this
subject prepared to have a discussion on the potential to open participation
in the Social Security System for our employees as part of a hybrid pension
system.
