Mr. Mayfield said there were complexities to whether the Council was
opening itself up to liabilities, which Mr. Jenkins could better address.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION FAILED 4-5, Beecham, Burch, Mossar, Morton
“yes.”

COUNCIL TOOK NO FURTHER ACTION ON THE MOTION.

RECESS: 9:40 p.m. to 9:50 p.m.

Ann Avis, Palo Alto Foundation for Education, said the Palo Alto Foundation
for Education (PAFE) raised funds to benefit all public schools in the Palo Alto
Unified School District (PAUSD). They awarded teacher grants and matched
private dollars with needs for the schools. The PAUSD had invested bond
funds totally $11 million in new science facilities at both Palo Alto and Gunn
High Schools. The bond funds, however, only covered what was nailed to the
walls and floors. PAFE invested $1 million in new equipment and technology,
which would be allocated equally to both high schools. She presented a
video regarding the One Million-Dollar High School Science Campaign.
