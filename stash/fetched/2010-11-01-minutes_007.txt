pleasurable walk.   He thanked Staff for their work on the upgrades to the
Preserve.

Mayor Burt reported on the Climate Change Art reception held on October
29th in the City Hall lobby. On October 28th he attended the San Francisquito
Creek JPA meeting where the discussion was on increased costs of the
upgrade to the lower segment of the below Highway 101 upgrade. The
disruption to our golf course would only be a matter of months rather than
years and the work would be done during non-peak golf season.        He had
the opportunity to look at the new facility being built by Bellomo Architects
which would be the first LEED Platinum building for Palo Alto.

ADJOURNMENT: The meeting adjourned at 8:50 p.m.
