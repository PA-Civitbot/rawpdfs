14.   Comprehensive Plan Update:        Comprehensive Plan Structure and
      Goals/Vision Statements for Each Element (Part I: Community
      Services & Facilities and Transportation Elements).

15.   Appointment of Five Additional Members to the Comprehensive Plan
      Update Citizens Advisory Committee.

Mayor Holman: A couple of points of business here. One is that for Item
Number 15, which again is now being taken up first, the City Clerk is going
to provide ballots. Anticipate that we'll be going through a few ballots. City
Clerk, if you want to make any comments or I can ask Council Members first
for their thoughts. Council Member Berman, you had asked previously what
our process would be for the voting. A couple of thoughts are that people
who get no votes would not go forward to a second round. Potentially,
people who get one vote would not go forward to a second round, given how
many candidates we have. Since you asked the question earlier, I'll give the
floor to you to make any recommendations that you might want or ask any
questions you might want to, to inform us on your persuasion.

Council Member Berman: I have no recommendations, but thank you. I
guess one question I'd have is what is the goal toâ€”what does somebody
need to get automatically chosen?

Mayor Holman: The goal is to get five people appointed, and they need five
votes to get appointed.

Council Member Berman: Yes, and they need five votes. Thank you.

Mayor Holman: Just like any Board or Commission. Correct, City Attorney?
You haven't had a chance to say anything. I just thought I'd throw you
something. Anyone would need five votes.

Council Member Filseth: (inaudible)
