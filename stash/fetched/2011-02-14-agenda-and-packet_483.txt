declined 49 percent from the average concentration for 2001 through 2004. The 2009
average effluent concentration is the lowest annual average concentration to date for
mercury. As shown in Figure 4-9, the effluent mercury concentration since early 2005
trended steadily downward through early 2006, then upward, then downward again. Since
the installation of amalgam separators, the correlation between effluent suspended solids
and mercury has become much stronger, and these trends track well with suspended
solids removal performance.
Mercury concentrations in the RWQCP’s pre-incineration sludge cake are presented in
Figures 4-10 and 4-11. Sludge cake samples are collected monthly. Sludge cake mercury
concentrations have declined substantially since 2004. The average concentration for
2006 through 2009 is 37 percent lower than the average for 2001 through 2004.
