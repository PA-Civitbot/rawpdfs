                         TRANSCRIPT
Mr. Keene: 16.04.05 now.

Council Member Holman:      I read that as violations of California Building
Code 16.04.05?

Ms. Stump: Which is adopted by Palo Alto with enhancements.            It's our
version of the California Building Code.

Council Member Holman: How is that linked to permits?

Ms. Stump: One of the requirements of the Code is that you have a permit
and that you comply with the conditions. Again, you can't read this item
here and understand the substantive provisions. This corresponds to other
sections of our Code. When you go to those sections listed on the left, you
see a whole series of substantive provisions. That's what you can be cited
for in the amounts listed here in this list.

Council Member Holman: I guess those are my questions for now. Council
Member Filseth has pointed out there is a truck route violation, which there
is. 10.48.030 is truck route violation, which has a funny number beside it,
211. Will Staff come back …

Ms. Stump: We read that section as a standing truck route. We thought
your question was associated with specific construction (crosstalk).

Council Member Holman: It is about construction. Staff will come back
then—just to clarify. Staff will come back with clarifications. We'll approve
this tonight, and Staff will come back with clarifications and what kind of
timeframe about 16.49.050 through 16.49.090. Do you have any kind of
timeframe?

Ms. Stump: That's a different topic. It's to address the substantive
Ordinance around historic structures. I think that's a discussion for the
Council to have with the City Manager about how that fits into the priority
work and the schedules. That really is not about the Administrative Penalty
Schedule. That's adjusting the substantive requirements of local law.

Council Member Holman: Last thing then is I would offer an amendment to
raise those penalties from $2,000 to $10,000.

Vice Mayor Scharff: Which penalties?

Council Member Holman: 050, 060, 070, 080, 090 on Page 63.
