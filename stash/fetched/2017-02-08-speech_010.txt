Now I want to turn our attention to the 5 priorities selected by the Council for this year:

Housing, Budget & Finance, Transportation, Infrastructure and Healthy Cities. These

priorities I believe accurately capture the community’s concerns and I want to highlight

where we are headed on each.




First is housing. Our region has a housing crisis – there is no way to delicately state

this. I am very proud that our community voted overwhelmingly in support of Measure A,

the Santa Clara County Affordable Housing bond that will bring much needed affordable

housing to the County.     Now, we need to get affordable housing projects into the

pipeline for approval and construction, and secure our share of the funding for

affordable housing authorized by Measure A.




Housing is a regional problem and we are not doing our fair share. Whereas we are

seen as a regional and even national leader on many issues, we sorely lag behind on

housing issues. We are not even looked at as part of the solution, but as part of the

problem. All types of housing, not just affordable housing, are needed and other cities

are stepping up and doing more than their fair share. Many in the community have

expressed concerns about the impacts of housing on school capacity. However, the

school district has seen declining enrollment numbers in elementary for the past few

years. Mountain View, Sunnyvale, Redwood City, and Menlo Park are all building tens

of thousands of housing units collectively.
