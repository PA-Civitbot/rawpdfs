STUDY SESSION

1.      City of Palo Alto’s Environmental Stewardship

Staff’s presentation on Environmental Stewardship in the City of Palo Alto -
Accomplishments and Challenges Ahead focused on four technical areas:
          – Reclaimed Water
          – Waste Reduction
          – Energy
          – Greenhouse Gas

The presentation highlighted selected accomplishments in environmental
stewardship with a presentation of Staff’s current focus on activities and
progress as well as directions, goals and next steps.

     z Reclaimed Water - Phil Bobel discussed advanced source control,
       meeting all irrigation requirements, multiple uses, the Service Area
       Master Plan and EIR as well as the Bay Area Wide Master Plan. All of
       those activities had been completed. The future focus of the program
       targeted on obtaining Federal funds, reducing salinity, addressing
       trace contaminants, achieving public acceptance, requiring recycled
       water use, and obtaining Hetch-Hetchy Allocation “credits” from San
       Francisco.

     z Waste Reduction - Wendy Hediger noted despite having a program for
       over 20 years, the City had only a 62 percent Diversion Rate in 2004.
       She also discussed moving from waste reduction to zero waste,
       concentrating on increased waste prevention, reuse, recycling and
       composting activities throughout the City, continued efforts toward
       extended producer responsibility, continued efforts toward Green
       Design and Clean Production, and encouraging environmentally
       preferable purchasing throughout the City.

     z Energy - Tom Auzenne noted Palo Alto Green was the number one
       program in the United States by participation rate with 14 percent of
       customers being enrolled and representing three percent of electricity
       use. The utilities focused on efficiency (a reduction in the City’s load by
