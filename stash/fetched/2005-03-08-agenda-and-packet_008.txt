ethical and accountable local government, which has earned the publicâ€™s full
confidence for integrity.

To this end, the City Council has adopted Council Protocols and this Code of
Ethics for members of the City Council to assure public confidence in the integrity
of local government and its effective and fair operation.

Comply with Law

the performance of their public duties. These laws include but are not limited to: the
United States and California constitutions, the city Charter, laws pertaining to conflicts of
interest, election campaigns, financial disclosures, employer responsibilities and open
processes of governments and City ordinances and policies.

Conduct of Members

even the appearance of impropriety. Members shall refrain from abusive conduct,
personal charges or verbal attacks upon the character or motives of other members of
the Council, boards and commissions, the staff or the public.

established by the City Council governing the deliberation of public policy issues,
meaningful involvement of the public and implementation of policy decisions of the City
Council by City staff.

Decisions Based on Merit
Members shall base their decisions on the merits and substance of the matter at hand,
rather than on unrelated considerations.

material financial interest or where they have an organizational responsibility or personal
relationship, which may give the appearance of a conflict of interest.

Gifts and Favors
Members commit to follow the laws that apply to accepting any gifts or favors as a public

financial or other private interests.

facilities, for private gain or personal purposes.
