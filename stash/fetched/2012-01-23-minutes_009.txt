Council Member Burt questioned the type of battery technology in use and
whether a compact battery technology was an alternative now.

Council Member Holman asked why this design was being placed on existing
poles rather than faux trees or an artistic pole design.

Ms. French indicated the applicant didn’t have a menu of options. She noted
ARB had discussed different means of camouflage, and the faux tree concept
had been proposed for use with multiple antennas rather than a single
antenna.

Council Member Holman inquired as to the results of the IDEO meeting.

Mr. Williams said the large size of the boxes required a large solution, and
IDEO would need a substantial amount of time to design a solution for that
size. He indicated IDEO had several ideas for designs if the size were
smaller. He indicated the structures were more obtrusive than the proposed
structure.

Council Member Holman asked if the ARB saw any of the IDEO concepts.

Ms. French answered yes, and noted there was a series of concept sketches
from IDEO.

Ms. Young indicated the ARB saw two different versions. She stated the
concept of combining all pieces into one large unit was not successful. She
said residents' concerns about a single tower proposal led to its withdrawal
and submission of the current proposal.

Council Member Holman thought a darker brown color would be more
consistent with the color of the pole.

Ms. Young stated there was a Condition of Approval requiring review of the
color closer to installation. She noted the color of poles varied depending on
sun exposure.

Council Member Holman did not recall a Condition of Approval regarding
color.

Ms. French answered there wasn't one. She stated Condition 7 of the
Approval noted an example color, but did not require that color be used.
