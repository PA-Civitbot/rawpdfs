If EPA seeks to require more frequent testing, then any final rule should provide for less frequent testing when

the results are sufficiently below the emission limit.

         F.        A Waste Management Plan Would Be Duplicative of the Waste Management Plans Already
                   Required by Part 503

        NACWA supports EPA’s conclusion that requiring waste management plans under § 129 would be
duplicative of the waste management practices already in place under the CWA. The numeric emission limits
and management practice requirements established under the Part 503 regulations are based on one of the
Agency’s largest risk assessments, which was conducted in the late 1980s and early 1990s to protect human
health and the environment from any reasonably anticipated adverse effects from pollutants that may be
present in sewage sludge.22 As a result, SSIs demonstrate that the emissions from their units are not adversely
impacting human health and the environment by demonstrating compliance with the Part 503 requirements.

        Pursuant to 40 CFR Part 403 (Part 403), POTWs additionally implement, through local regulatory
authority, pretreatment standards to prevent discharge of pollutants to the POTW that may pass through or
interfere with treatment processes. Pretreatment reduces harmful constituents in the sewage sludge combusted
by incinerators. Pretreatment has dramatically reduced the contaminants in sewage sludge and accordingly
emissions from SSIs have become cleaner. Comparison of the sewage sludge quality measured in the 1980s23
with the measurements in EPA’s 2006-2007 Targeted National Sewage Sludge Survey shows a clear improvement in
sewage sludge quality since Part 403 and Part 503 were implemented. Specifically, NEORSD, which serves the
City of Cleveland and 61 suburban communities, has seen significant decreases in the concentrations of heavy
metals in both its influent, attributable to the Part 403 regulations, and its effluent, attributable to both Part
403 and Part 503.24 Between 1980 and 2004, NEORSD has seen the concentration of lead in the influent
reduced by 95 percent while the concentration of lead in the effluent was reduced by 100 percent.25

        POTWs are already employing successful management practices to comply with Part 403 and Part 503
under the CWA. Requiring additional management plans under CAA § 129 would be duplicative of these
efforts and needlessly waste resources that can be better allocated to complying with other provision of the
Proposed Rule.

         G.        Emission Limits Appropriately Apply Only When Sludge Is Being Fed to the Incinerator

       NACWA supports an approach that makes emission standards applicable only when an incinerator is
being charged. Since an incinerator may only be regulated under § 129 if it is combusting a solid waste, it is
appropriate to limit the application of the emission limits to the periods when a solid waste is being combusted.
This may also simplify compliance during startup and shutdown, because the sludge is not being fed to the
