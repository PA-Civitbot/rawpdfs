on the Top 5 Priorities for the second calendar year of the two-year budget,
but did not develop new priorities.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to amend the second sentence under No. 1
Developing and Monitoring the Council’s Top 5 Priorities, to read “The
Council should review in the second year of a two-year budget the top
priorities and milestones in conjunction with the City Manager’s update of
the budget,” in place of “The Council should formalize its practice of
developing its “Top 5” Priorities (and milestones) early in each calendar year
before the City Manager prepares the City’s proposed budget.”

Council Member Mossar said item 1 should state the Council set its priorities
for a two-year budget cycle, and reviewed them in the mid-budget year.

Council Member Ojakian said part of his intent was to ensure future Council
Members understood the Top 5 Priorities.

Council Member Kleinberg said she hoped anyone who decided to run for
Council would know what the Top 5 Priorities were or have suggested
alternatives.

Council Member Kishimoto expressed support for the motion. She suggested
the budget was not just the Top 5 Priorities, but also other issues that came
up such as the libraries or sewers.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to change the word “adequate” to “appropriate” in
the last sentence of the first paragraph under item 1. Developing and
Monitoring the Council’s Top 5 Priorities.

MOTION PASSED 9-0.
