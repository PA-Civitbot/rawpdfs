A.         Adopt a Resolution to:

     i.         Maintain the Palo Alto CLEAN program price for local solar
                energy resources at the current price of $0.165 per kilowatt-
                hour ($/kWh) for a 20-year or 25-year contract term, and
                continue with a program limit of 3 megawatts (MW); and

     ii.        Reduce the Palo Alto CLEAN program price for local non-solar
                eligible renewable energy resources to the updated avoided cost
                of such energy ($0.081/kWh for a 20-year contract term, or
                $0.082/kWh for a 25-year contract term), from the prior avoided
                cost projection ($0.093/kWh for a 20-year contract term, or
                $0.094/kWh for a 25-year contract term), and continue with a
                separate program limit of 3 MW specifically for local non-solar
                eligible renewable resources; and

B.         Approve the amended CLEAN program Power Purchase Agreement
           (PPA) to implement the recommended changes.
