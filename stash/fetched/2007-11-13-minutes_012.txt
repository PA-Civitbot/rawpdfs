Council Member Morton stated 2010 was only two years from now and the
Army Core of Engineers has notified their process would take five years to
complete. Beginning negotiations with the County was merely to find out
what the steps would be to determine the conditions under which we would
terminate the lease early.

Council Member Beecham asked staff the basis of the three year term for
the Army Core of Engineers.

Mr. Fellman stated anticipation of receiving the Army Core of Engineers
information of the levy was in 2010 to know what was needed to be done on
the levy.

Council Member Beecham asked whether there were separate issues
between the levy and the creek solution.

Mr. Fellman stated yes, there were separate studies.

Council Member Beecham stated he would not be supporting the Substitute
Motion.

Council Member Drekmeier asked for the difference between the Motion and
substitute Motion.

Mayor Kishimoto stated the difference was within the work load necessary
from staff and the Substitute Motion added three years.

Mr. Yeats stated there was enough work for staff to start studying the
processes necessary to partake in the beginning stages of negotiations. Staff
would come back to Council with a workplan including estimated timeframes,
required staff time, and cost.

Council Member Beecham asked whether that was the intent of the original
Motion, to have staff return with a workplan.

Vice Mayor Klein stated that was incorporated in the Motion.

Mayor Kishimoto stated the priority would be the creek flooding the
property.

Council Member Drekmeier stated his support for the original Motion.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION FAILED: 2-6 Kishimoto, Cordell yes, Mossar absent

MOTION PASSED: 5-3, Kishimoto, Cordell, Beecham no, Mossar absent.
