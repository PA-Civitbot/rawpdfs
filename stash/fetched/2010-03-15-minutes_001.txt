STUDY SESSION

1.   Joint Study Session with the Planning and Transportation Commission
     (P&TC) to Discuss Palo Alto Planning and Transportation Issues.

Dan Garber, Chair of the Planning and Transportation Commission, noted
that the Commission's annual report to Council was provided, along with a
transmittal letter outlining three key broad issues to be considered. He said
that the report supplanted prior efforts by staff and the Commission to
provide an annual review of the Comprehensive Plan, and that the report
also more directly addresses issues that have arisen since the adoption of
the plan. The Council and Commission then discussed a number of the issues
in the report, including the Commission's intent regarding construction of
new multi-family housing, review processes that may help to provide more
consistency between zoning and the Comprehensive Plan, and the adequacy
of parking (particularly for multi-family housing). Vice Chair Tuma noted that
the annual report provides a "gap analysis" between the prior
Comprehensive Plan and changed circumstances since the Plan's adoption.
Vice Mayor Espinosa asked how the list of Commission objectives is
addressed by staff in its work program, and the City Manager responded that
this is an issue that is before the Policy and Services Committee to set
priorities within the resource limitations of staff.
