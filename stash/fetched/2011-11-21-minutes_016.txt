item would need details or parameters and that Staff would need to draft the
item as broadly as possible.


Mr. Keene said Staff might ask Council to allow time for Staff to return with
alternatives before they take action.


Council Member Klein said he was undecided on the 15 percent contingency
which would be further discussed when the item returned to the Council. He
wanted   to   make   clear   that   the    City,   the   contractor,   the   contract
administrator, and the architects were all responsible for change orders. He
said the Council may approve something where the City was not totally
responsible for the change order.


Council Member Burt stated there were shared concerns on how the contract
started with an abnormal number of change orders and amounts that remain
ongoing at this point. Overall the project was still under budget.


INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to change in the Motion “consider adjusting the
contingency to 15 percent” to “evaluate the contingency percentage”.


Mayor Espinosa stated he was not sure the item was ready to be placed on
the Consent Calendar but hopeful it would get there in the near future.           He
said this was an exciting project for the City and the Council was please that
it was well under budget. There were concerns regarding oversight. He said
right processes had been put in place to make sure the City was on top of
the oversights and reviewed monthly.
