Existing Link Level of Service
Roadway links were analyzed using volume to capacity (V/C) ratios. The traffic volumes
were measured in the field using recent traffic counts. The results of this analysis are

Existing Queuing
Queue lengths were calculated for each of the study intersections to check whether any
excessive queues are occurring under existing conditions (see Table 6). At all of the STOP
controlled intersections the 95th percentile queue lengths are shown to be four cars at the
most (two cars per lane, 50 feet per lane). Queues are longest at the El Camino Real
intersection. The 95th percentile queues on westbound California Avenue are shown to be
up to 8 cars. The longest queues are for the through lane in the AM peak hour, the left turn
lane for the mid-day peak hour, and the right turn for the PM peak hour. The right turn lane
is of insufficient length to accommodate 8 cars. Therefore, some right turn cars queue in
the through lane.
