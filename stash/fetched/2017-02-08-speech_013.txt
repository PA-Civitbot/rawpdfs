study will give us recommendations about better managing the parking supply we have,

and suggest ways we might generate revenues to support the fledgling Transportation

Management Association (TMA).




The City helped establish the TMA with the goal of reducing solo commute trips by

private automobiles by 30% and the organization is starting to take its first steps to

address this goal. The Council will be receiving a report on the status of their efforts –

and on similar efforts in the Stanford Research Park – on March 6th. During the year,

we will be looking for other ways to help the organization mature and thrive.




Rail

I also expect that this will be a productive year on many fronts for our Rail

Committee. The Rail Committee will be under the leadership of Councilmember Tom

Dubois this year who is passionate about these issues and will be an effective

champion of Palo Alto’s interests. The goal of the Rail Committee is to analyze Caltrain

grade separation alternatives and be in a position to select a preferred grade separation

alternative by this time next year. This will allow us to move onto the activities that will

make our project “shovel ready.” This is vitally important for Palo Alto after the passage

of County Measure B. Measure B provided $700 million for Grade Separations and it is

critical that Palo Alto be in a position to secure its fair share of that money.

       Councilmember Dubois could you please stand up and be recognized? Let’s

       give a hand to Councilmember Dubois for his leadership on this important issue.
