Council Member DuBois: I'll second it.

AMENDMENT:        Council Member Tanaka moved, seconded by Council
Member DuBois to add to the Motion, “refer review of this RPP Program to
the Planning and Transportation Commission prior to Council’s review.” (New
Part F)

Council Member Filseth: Can I ask what it is that we're voting on here?

Mayor Scharff: I wasn't sure what we were voting on either.

Council Member Tanaka: Basically in a year this gets reviewed by the PTC
before it hits us.

Mayor Scharff: Is this when it comes back in a year?

Council Member Tanaka: Yeah.

Mayor Scharff: When it comes back in a year, it goes to the PTC first.

Council Member Tanaka: Correct.

Mayor Scharff: Then, it comes here.

Council Member Tanaka: Correct.

Mayor Scharff: Got it.

Council Member Wolbach: (Inaudible) by them before (inaudible).

Mayor Scharff:     That passes on a 7-1 with Council Member Filseth
abstaining.

AMENDMENT PASSED: 7-0-1 Filseth abstain, Kniss absent

Mayor Scharff: Greg, anything further? Council Member Fine.

Council Member Fine: I've got a couple here. One, I was noticing that
currently it's got five permits per household. I'm wondering why Staff chose
that figure. In College Terrace, I think we're three.

Ms. Gitelman: We just took that number from the Downtown program. It's
worked pretty well. There's a variety of housing types in this neighborhood
like there is in Downtown, particularly on the Mayfield side. We thought it
would work.
