Council Member Klein stated that the community’s perception was that the
project was over budget. He clarified it was not and was $7 million under
budget. He stated the Downtown Library project was under budget and was
completed on time.    The community needed to know that the Council and
Staff were keeping on top of the project and that they cared about the
public’s money and that it was spent wisely.


Council Member Shepherd noted that the color chart clearly showed the
project was under budget. She asked Staff to explain Change Order #9 that
included the addition of a basketball court slab and the foundation for an art
sculpture.


Mr. Bobel explained that the material for the basketball court slab was not
specified in the original bid and the foundation for the art sculpture was
overlooked and not included in the design.


Council Member Shepherd agreed with Council Member Klein’s comment to
spend the public’s money wisely; however, she noted that Staff had
indicated that a 15 percent contingency worked in the past and could be
reconsidered.   She asked Staff what their thoughts were in making an
incremental move.


Mr. Keene stated that in September the Council had reduced the Staff’s
contingency request from 25 to 20 percent and have considered another
reduction from 15 to 10 percent. He said history has shown that 10 percent
was the norm. Staff’s job was to keep the spending as low as possible. The
monthly meeting reports would show which way the project was moving and
felt that the Council could decide what contingencies should be set for the
months ahead.
