AMENDMENT: Council Member Ojakian moved, seconded by Freeman, to
have $800,000 taken from the General Fund and given to Storm Drain Fund
on an annual basis.

Council Member Morton said he would not support the amendment to the
motion.

Council Member Freeman said she hoped a reserve would be created.

Council Member Mossar said funds would not be available for other services
if $800,000 were dedicated to the Storm Drain Fund.

Council Member Cordell said it was not sensible to propose a fee, tax, or
bond without receiving a sense of support from the community.

Council Member Morton said the community programs were funded by the
General Fund and would be impacted by the reduction of $800,000.

Council Member Kishimoto asked whether the $800,000 would still be
transferred out of the General Fund if the measure failed.

City Manager Frank Benest said $800,000 had been taken out of the General
Fund for several years and used for basic maintenance on the storm drain
system.

Council Member Kishimoto believed some of the $800,000 should be used
for curbs and gutters to maintain the system.

Council Member Freeman said a reserve was desired and needed. There
were areas where money could be saved; one of the areas could be the size
of the Cityâ€™s staff.

Council Member Kleinberg said she did not believe the decision to transfer
$800,000 annually should be appended out of context to the main proposal.

Mr. Benest said the $800,000 subsidy was not included in the budget going
forward; the deficit would grow from $5.2 million to $6 million.

AMENDMENT FAILED 3-6, Freeman, Kishimoto, Ojakian yes.

Council Member Kleinberg said there was a responsibility to the community
to do what was right for the greater good. She asked staff whether the
wording for the ballot needed to be voted on by the Council.
