                         TRANSCRIPT
Ms. Silver: Yes. We still want to solicit comments on the current scenarios
that we have published in the EIR.

Mayor Burt: Just wanted to make sure. Council Member DuBois.

Council Member DuBois: To clarify, I'm just speaking to the Motion and
would like to continue this conversation. If we reopen comments, how long
would the comment period be?

Ms. Gitelman:   I think our current schedule assumes again a 60-day
comment period.

Council Member DuBois: Thank you for the Motion. This really addresses, I
think, one of my major concerns. I think I mentioned it before. I think this
idea of multiple scenarios and mixing and matching is very confusing for the
public to comment. Adding two more scenarios and treating those in a
supplement, I think, was going to be even more confusing. It's better that
we're doing them altogether. I think even better would be to have a
preferred scenario by the time we get to that final comment period. If
anybody else wants to propose that as an amendment, I'm happy with this
motion. Huh?

Mayor Burt: Propose what as an amendment?

Council Member DuBois: Having actually a preferred alternative when we
get to public comment. I think this is a big improvement, so I support the
motion.

MOTION RESTATED: Council Member Holman moved, seconded by Vice
Mayor Scharff to reopen the public comment period for the Comprehensive
Plan Draft Environmental Impact Report (DEIR) for Scenarios 1-4, to run
concurrently with the public comment period for Scenarios 5 and 6.

Mayor Burt: I see no more lights, so we can vote just on this Motion, and
then we can go into our actual discussion of scenarios. That passesâ€”Vice
Mayor Schmid, are you voting? Did you vote? I mean Council Member
Schmid. Just not working. Is it a yes? No. That passes on an 8-1 vote
with Council Member Schmid voting no.

MOTION PASSED: 8-1 Schmid no

Mayor Burt: Now, we can go back to our actual comments on scenarios.
Council Member DuBois.

Council Member DuBois: A quick question. When we get to the feedback on
Scenarios 5 and 6, I'd actually went back and looked at our May list. The
