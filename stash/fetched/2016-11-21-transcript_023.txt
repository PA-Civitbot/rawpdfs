Council Member Kniss: Could I ask you a couple of questions?

Mr. Hopkins: Hopefully I can answer them.

Council Member Kniss: Just come on up to the mic.

Mayor Burt: You can come up to the mic.

Council Member Kniss: Otherwise, you won't get recorded properly. I'm
looking at the naming and recognition which is on Page 5. Interested in
knowing, since I can see the Peerys have been extremely generous, whether
or not there is some naming opportunity for that family or do they not want
that.

Mr. Hopkins: I believe we're still kind of considering that. We haven't
decided exactly how we're going to approach the naming. You're talking
specifically for the Peerys?

Council Member Kniss: Specifically, right.

Mr. Hopkins: We haven't discussed that as of yet and decided. The $15
million did not include that, but that may be an option, something that they
would like. We haven't finalized it.

Council Member Kniss: That's an extremely generous donation. I have no
idea what their intention was, whether or not they wanted to be recognized
or not. I noticed that in here we are going to look at the possibility of there
being naming opportunities.

Mr. Hopkins: Yes.

Council Member Kniss: Which sometimes gets complicated in a City. I know
that we'll do a good job of really taking a hard look at that and deciding how
to do it.

Mr. Hopkins: Absolutely. Thank you. We've been discussing it in our Board
meetings, and we are prepared for that. We will address it with even
(inaudible) to that.

Council Member Kniss: I can see you have a former Mayor on your team, so
I'm pretty sure that he's aware of that as well.

Mr. Hopkins: Absolutely. We've been discussing that. Thank you.
