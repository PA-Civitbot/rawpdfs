set back. It's a little more in the shadows there underneath the overhang,
where it will go in.

Mr. Eggleston: Yeah. Just to clarify a little on the earlier comments. When
the package was put together and taken to ARB, a podium sign was included
for the "police" sign, because of the fact that there's no easy way to mount it
to the building. The "City Hall" sign was mounted to the front of the
building.

Council Member Burt: Based on that clarification, I would change my
proposed Amendment to just be that the "City Hall" sign be attached to the
building, and not the police. If that's acceptable.

AMENDMENT RESTATED AND INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION
WITH THE CONSENT OF THE MAKER AND SECONDER to add to the
Motion at the end of Part A, “retain existing stairway sign.”

AMENDMENT RESTATED AND INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION
WITH THE CONSENT OF THE MAKER AND SECONDER to replace in the
Motion Part B, “Eliminate the planned “CITY HALL” podium sign” with
“Eliminate the podium and attach the “CITY HALL” sign to the building.”

Mayor Holman: With that Amendment, you lost my vote. Let's see what the
language is for "a." Vote on the board please.

Council Member Kniss:     Is the "police" still on the podium or not on the
podium?

Council Member DuBois: On the podium.

Council Member Kniss: Still on the podium.

Mayor Holman: The Motion is to eliminate the planned "police" podium sign
as was in the presentation. It is the original Motion to eliminate the planned
"police" podium sign that was presented to us tonight, and retain the
existing stairway sign.

Mr. Keene: There will be no new sign.

Mayor Holman: That Motion fails on a 3-5 vote with Council Members
Berman, Schmid, Holman—I can't see, hang on. With Council Member
Scharff not participating. That Motion fails.

MOTION PART A RESTATED: Eliminate the planned “POLICE” podium sign
and retain existing stairway sign.
