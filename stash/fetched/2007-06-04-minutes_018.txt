Mayor Kishimoto stated there were medical offices located all over the City,
which used industrial grade electrical machinery, and she supported the
motion.

Council Member Barton asked about the uses of SOFA 1.

Mr. Emslie stated the plan had the City’s standard non-conforming
regulations attached to the uses and structures that did not conform to their
current zoning, which stated non-conforming use can exist and be reused
indefinitely. The new zoning code stated that “office” did not distinguish
between any type of office, and continued unless an amortization schedule
was imposed, which would continue in the regulations under SOFA 1.

Council Member Drekmeier asked about the health effects of the transformer
present at 400 Channing Avenue.

Mr. Emslie replied there was a slight risk of hazard from a transformer. The
City had enacted an Ordinance that required new transformers to be pad-
mounted on the surface versus below ground. There was a risk of explosion
generally with the older, wet models and the electromagnetic fields that
were generated.

Council Member Drekmeier asked whether the other locations had the same
transformer.

Mr. Emslie stated he was not sure.

Council Member Drekmeier asked whether the                City   required   the
transformers to include power for down the street.

Mr. Emslie stated each transformer was designed to take into account the
loads in that area, which would be more than the property on which it was
located.

Council Member Drekmeier asked whether the transformer was considerably
larger than the average transformer because of the needs of 400 Channing
Avenue.

Mr. Emslie replied it had to do with the area it was serving.

Council Member Drekmeier asked what a transformer would look like and
where it would be located in a residential neighborhood.
