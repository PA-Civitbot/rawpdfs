CONSENT CALENDAR

Council Member Freeman asked whether the Council was being asked to
vote only for staff’s recommendation for Item No. 7 (CMR: 170:05) and not
Attachment A.

Assistant City Manager Emily Harrison said Council was asked to vote for or
against the four bullets on the front of the staff report (CMR:170:05).

Council Member Morton stated he would not participate in Item No. 5 due to
a conflict of interest because he had clients with interests in the properties.

Council Member Mossar said her vote on Item No. 7 had no bearing or
opinion on the Mayfield project.

Norman Carroll, 425 High Street, spoke to Item No. 7 and said the
Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) allocations were instrumental
in funding programs and capital projects, which addressed the needs of
those with the smallest voice. The Federal proposal under review by Council
that evening allocated funding from several social programs serving different
needs into a single smaller pot. He expressed support for the current CDBG
program.

MOTION: Council Member Mossar moved, seconded by Cordell, to approve
Consent Calendar Item Nos. 2-5 and 7-9.
