months of the purchase and to increase the rent subsidy to 100 percent.
Residents were entitled to start-up costs for the first and last month rent
and security deposit. Wherever Buena Vista residents chose to relocate,
they would pay the same rent as they paid at Buena Vista for 15 months.
The Ordinance required rent subsidies for 12 months. The Hearing Officer
found the park owner should pay actual, reasonable moving costs. The park
owner accepted that. The Hearing Officer determined additional assistance
should be provided to handicapped residents. The Ordinance required the
park owner to pay fees of the housing relocation specialist; however, the
specialist did not work for the park owner and was not an agent of the park
owner. The Hearing Officer stated that he would not retain jurisdiction, but
the housing relocation specialist was capable of making decisions and
binding those upon the park owner. The Council should recognize that the
payment was a lump-sum payment. The residents would be paid in a single
check without regard to where the residents chose to move. The payment
was based on average rents in Palo Alto and surrounding cities. Total start-
up costs represented 15 months of rent. The appraiser estimated a 31
percent increase in the median mobile home price between 2013 and 2014.
The original average appraised value of a Buena Vista mobile home was
$18,816. If the park closed today, the average appraised value would be
$24,649. The 12-month rent subsidy would total $22,441. Start-up costs
would total $7,860. Estimated moving costs were $1,100. Assistance for
disabled residents would be determined. The assistance package totaled
$56,050. The current appraised value of a two-bedroom home with a 31
percent increase was $24,649; the 12-month subsidy would be more than
$27,000; start-up costs would be more than $9,000; estimated moving
costs would be $1,100; for a total package amount of $62,103. A 1955
travel trailer with addition was valued at $17,000, for which the appraiser
stated there was no offsite value noted. If that mobile home was not
located at Buena Vista, it would have zero intrinsic value. The home was
valued at $17,000 only because the home was located in Palo Alto on
property he owned and which he rented. There were serious problems when
the home value was based solely on the home being located on property the
homeowner already owned. Buena Vista was not a traditional mobile home
park. Only 30 Buena Vista homes were mobile homes within the definition
of either the Health and Safety Code or the California Administrative Code.
The remaining homes were either RVs, travel trailers, or trailers, some as
old as the early 1950s. The park did not contain proper infrastructure to
support a modern mobile home. The average square footage and average
age of existing homes did not compare to modern mobile homes. She
provided pictures of Buena Vista homes and the additions made to them.
Trulia listings submitted by the Residents Association did not look like and
were not comparable to units in Buena Vista. Being located in Palo Alto did
not transform the physical characteristics of Buena Vista homes. At the
