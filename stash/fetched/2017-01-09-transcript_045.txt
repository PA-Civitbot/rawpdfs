Council Member Wolbach: Let's just do "A" (inaudible).

Council Member DuBois: Are we just voting on the Amendment over again?

Mayor Scharff: We basically are.

Council Member DuBois: Why would we do that? We just passed it.

Mayor Scharff: The Amendment stays in. Yes, you're right the Amendment
stays in. I guess the only question is do we need to vote separately, Cory,
on "A." Would there be anybody who's not going to vote for "A" or would
you feel you couldn't vote for this at all?

Council Member Wolbach: With the new "A," I'm not voting—I can't vote for
"A." I'm the maker of the Motion, so I'd like to vote for the other parts.

Council Member Holman: Mr. Mayor?

Mayor Scharff: Yes.

Council Member Holman: The Amendment that just passed replaced "A."

Mayor Scharff: That's correct.

Council Member Holman: It's in there now.

Mayor Scharff: Why don't we just vote on "B" and "C," and then I'll come
back and vote on "A"? I'm doing this for Council Member Wolbach.

Council Member Wolbach: Appreciate it.

Mayor Scharff: Let's vote on "B" and "C." That's what I said, right?

Vice Mayor Kniss: Mm hmm.

Mayor Scharff: That passes unanimously.

MOTION PARTS B AND C PASSED: 9-0

Mayor Scharff: Now, we'll just vote on "A." It doesn't really make sense
what I'm doing. It makes no sense.

Vice Mayor Kniss: I think you've already replaced (crosstalk) …

Mayor Scharff: We voted on "A" already. It makes no sense.

Vice Mayor Kniss: … substitute "A."
