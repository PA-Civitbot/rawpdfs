Council Member Drekmeier said the building was in the area to be rezoned.

Mr. Baum said he did not believe the decision would affect Council Member
Drekmeier’s source of income but it gave the appearance of a conflict.

Council Member Drekmeier stated he would not participate in the item due
to a conflict of interest because his employer owned property within 500 feet
of the area.

Public Hearing opened at 9:58 p.m.

Smita Joshi, 851 E. Meadow Drive, urged the Council to not allow zoning for
auto dealerships and not to rely on a case by case basis to review new
proposals.

Earl Caustin, 3671 Louis Road, urged the Council to identify the areas that
would be allowed to be rezoned and avoid the west side of Bayshore.

Arthur Keller, 3881 Corina Way, spoke against using the west side of
Bayshore for auto dealerships.

Public Hearing closed at 10:05 p.m.

MOTION: Council Member Barton moved, seconded by Beecham, to
approve the staff recommendation to adopt an ordinance amending the Auto
Dealership (AD) combining district to allow the AD overlay zone in the
Limited Manufacturing (LM) districts located on the east side of Highway 101
at the San Antonio Interchange, and that the applications for Auto
Dealership development in these zones require a Conditional Use Permit
(CUP).

      Staff also recommends that the Auto Dealership (AD) Combining
      District Ordinance include the following additional language to address
      the use of auto display platforms with specific site development
      applications:

      “SECTION 3, Subparagraph (b) of Section 18.65.070              [Special
      Requirements] is hereby added to read as follows:

           (5) Two automobile display pads shall be permitted for each
      auto dealership site, and shall be subject to Architectural Review
      Board approval.
