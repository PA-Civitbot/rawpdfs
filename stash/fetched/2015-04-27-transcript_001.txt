James Keene, City Manager: Thank you. Good evening. I'm a little bit
under the weather. On top of which, you all have just scheduled a half hour
for this session, because you've got a big topic this evening. I probably will
depart after the Consent Calendar, but I did want to be sure to fulfill my
obligations here on transmitting the Operating and Capital Budgets for Fiscal
Year 2016. What we will do, particularly for those of you Council Members
who are new, I'm going to read some excerpts from the transmittal letter
