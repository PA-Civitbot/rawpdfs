had been a problem in the past. She inquired about the limitations of an
appointment system versus a queuing system.

Mr. Emslie said appointments help Staff manage work flow; however,
queuing software would help Staff manage walk-in customers.

Council Member Holman asked if part of the IT improvements would allow
public access to more documents and information through the City's web
site.

Mr. Emslie stated it would.

Council Member Holman asked Staff to respond to comments concerning a
movement towards reducing tree protections.

Mr. Emslie stated there hadnâ€™t been any move to change the tree protection
manual or any standards. He indicated there had been a few service
enhancements to tree protection.

MOTION: Council Member Price moved, seconded by Council Member
Scharff to accept Staff recommendation to adopt the Ordinance amending
the Budget for the fiscal year 2012 to provide additional appropriations of
$1,520,426 to fund the implementation of the Blueprint Process Plan for the
Development Center.

Council Member Price stated she supported this Motion because the action is
necessary and overdue.

Council Member Scharff thanked the City Manager for supporting this project
and for changing the culture.

Council Member Schmid inquired if revenues in the 2012 Budget had
declined, as there was a surplus in the prior Budget and none in the 2012
Budget.

Mr. Emslie explained that these actions bring expenditures and services in
parity.

Council Member Schmid asked if the City Council had to resolve a $1.3
million shortfall.

Mr. Keene explained the $1.3 million was not spent but placed in the Budget
Stabilization Reserve at the end of the year. He further explained the
drawdown of the Budget Stabilization Reserve in 2012 to offset the funding.
