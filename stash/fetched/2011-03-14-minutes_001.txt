ACTION

1. Acceptance of Long Range Financial Forecast.

The City Council discussed the updated Long Range Financial Forecast as
amended by the Finance Committee. The forecast reflected deficits for the
next 10 years starting with Fiscal Year 2012 which has a projected deficit of
$2.3 million. The discussion focused on the drivers of the deficit. These
being the downturn in key revenues and increasing employee benefit costs
along with their impacts to future budgets specifically pension and health
care premiums. Other topics of discussion were the over $500 million
infrastructure needs and backlog and the need to have a plan in place to
address the need. The various assumptions on rate increases for revenues
and costs were discussed as well.

MOTION: Council Member Schmid moved, seconded by Council Member
Burt to accept the Long Range Financial Forecast as the base model to
include; 1) Health Care Costs Increase 10 % per year; 2) Eliminate assumed
Transient Occupancy Tax (TOT) from Mingâ€™s Hotel; 3) Assume California
Public Employee Retirement System (CalPERS) discount rate decreases to
7.5 %; and 4) Assume CalPERS rates increase 3% per year from 2015-2021.

Council Member Schmid said the four additional items regarding the CalPERS
and health benefits were derived from the Service Efforts and
Accomplishments (SEA) Report as having structural issues in benefits. He
