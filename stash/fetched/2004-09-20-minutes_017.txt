Council Member Kleinberg asked how staff felt about the message being sent
regarding non-conforming uses.

Ms. Grote said it was a unique case. The location and building design was
different than most. The case was an exception to the rule and not the
standard way of dealing with code enforcement.

Council Member Kleinberg asked if Stewart Title were to leave, would the
vacated space need to revert to retail and the back half to office use.

Ms. Grote said her understanding was if Stewart Title were amortized over
time, concurrent with the length of its lease, the new tenant would need to
meet the new requirements.

Council Member Kleinberg asked if the proposal were approved specifically
for 2409 Park Boulevard and the tenancy changed, could the front be zoned
for retail and the back for office use.

City Attorney Gary Baum said Stewart Title would be amortized for a
reasonable amount of time, such as through the end of their lease.
Otherwise, it would need to be set up as legal non-conforming and expire
with a 12-month lapse, as stated in the Ordinance.

Ms. Grote said Stewart Title was in the process or may have already vacated
the space.

Council Member Kleinberg proposed an amendment to have the building at
2409 Park Boulevard be zoned with the front half for retail and the back half
converted to office.

Council Member Morton accepted the amendment.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER that the previous location of Stewart Title at 2409
Park Boulevard would have retail in the front of the building and office space
in the back of the building.

Council Member Kishimoto felt the building was in a good location. She had
concerns about a building being rezoned due to its poor design. She asked
what the size of the remaining internal area was in Buildings C and D.

Ms. Grote said she would provide Council Member Kishimoto with the
information.
