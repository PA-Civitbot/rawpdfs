Mr. Emslie said he would look for the answer.

Vice Mayor Kleinberg said in the future, the amounts should be included in
the City Manager’s Report (CMRs). She noted less than one quarter of the
households in the neighborhood wanted the speed calming to be permanent.

Mr. Kott said 19 percent of the households that replied were in favor of
retaining the street calming.

Vice Mayor Kleinberg said it could be concluded from the report that a
quarter of the households in the project area and environs, favored the plan.
She asked how to build the response from the neighbors into the survey.

Mr. Kott said it was difficult to interest individuals who were not directly
affected.

Vice Mayor Kleinberg said the neighborhood community support had
declined. The surveys could not be judged fairly as to whether the traffic
calming should be implemented in the neighborhoods.

Mr. Emslie said the project had been initiated several years earlier prior to
the City’s guidelines for initiating a new project.

Council Member Freeman said the evaluation of future traffic calming
measures should be based on a majority. Parameters of collecting survey
information should be considered.

Council Member Morton said substantial support had been shown for the
traffic calming.

Vice Mayor Kleinberg said the numbers were included in the report.

Mr. Kott said the explanation of the numbers was of all the households,
which included the surrounding neighborhood; 23 percent indicated they
were in favor of the traffic calming.

Council Member Morton said if 23 percent responded affirmatively, it would
be unfair to assume that the non-respondents were negative.
Vice Mayor Kleinberg said surveys and data should be used and collected
carefully.

Mr. Emslie said the implementation of the trial was $68,000, modifications
were $12,000, landscaping costs were $2,000, for a total of $82,000.
