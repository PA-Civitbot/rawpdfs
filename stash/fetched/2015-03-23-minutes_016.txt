requested the City join the Atherton lawsuit as an amicus because of safety
issues.

Herb Borock advised that the Minutes of January 26, 2015 should include the
vote or abstention of each member present on action taken in order to
comply with the Brown Act. He read the legislative history from the
Assembly Committee on Local Government hearing of June 26, 2013.

Molly Stump, City Attorney, advised that Mayor Holman reported on January
