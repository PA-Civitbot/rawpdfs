Mr. de Geus: I thought about that too, Council Member DuBois. I think that
would be a sensible thing to do.

Council Member DuBois: Super quick, looking at the expenses. What was
contract maintenance, merchant fee reimbursement, fixed management
fees? Are those committed costs we have to pay even when the course is
closed?

Mr. de Geus: The pro shop is still open. The practice facility is still open.
We still have some services happening there. It's reduced significantly from
when we were open. There is some maintenance costs as well for the whole
front end of the golf course. Our maintenance contractor will also help with
the grow-in of the new turf.

Council Member DuBois: Is there anything we can do to accelerate the
opening or is that really based on how long it takes for the new landscaping
to take root?

Mr. de Geus: It's accelerated. It's pretty ambitious as it is.

Council Member DuBois: I just wondered if you ...

Mayor Burt: You want the grass to grow faster, is that what you're saying?

Council Member DuBois: One of the biggest costs is actually being closed.
The sooner we get open the better.

Mr. de Geus: The way to open sooner would be to use more sod and lay it
down, but that's a lot more expensive as well. We are using some sod, but
mostly using what are called sprigs. You take the plant and you plant plugs
every so many inches, and then it grows out over time. It's significantly less
expensive. It grows in well, but it does take time.

Council Member DuBois:       I was wondering, though, do we need any
incentives for the contractor to make sure they hit their schedule. Is that
something we've considered?

Mr. de Geus: We do normally consider that.
