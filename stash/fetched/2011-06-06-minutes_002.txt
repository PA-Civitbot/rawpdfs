CONSENT CALENDAR

Herb Borock spoke regarding Agenda Item No. 3. He felt it was premature
to take a stance on the proposal for several reasons including timing and the
pending lawsuit. He suggested they look at the items which the High Speed
Rail Authorities agreed upon. He cited information from Eurostar Rail and
lessons they have learned regarding high speed rail.

changing the wording in the graph, contained in the letter, to “System
should remain within Caltrain ROW(Right of Way)”, which he believed was
appropriate.

approve Agenda Item Numbers 1-3, to include changing the wording in the
graph of Agenda Item Number 3, contained in the letter, to “System should
remain within Caltrain ROW”.
