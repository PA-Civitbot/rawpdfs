Mr. Quinn said a number of iterations were done. The final iteration,
after some peer review, the larger parcel was at the 1.5 FAR. If the
economic value of the existing building was already significant or high,
the incentive was not to redevelopment because it was already making
a lot of money for the existing landowner.
Council Member Freeman referred to the staff report (CMR:386:03)
the Council had received on the Phase 2 “Answers to Questions”
number A-2, second paragraph. She said the designs that used a
1.5:1FAR in the RT-35 district and a 2.1 FAR in a RT-50 yielded 120
dwelling units. When a 1.15 FAR was used throughout the area, it
yielded 90 units. The numbers were approximate. She suggested
small steps be taken so the area would not become overly dense and
lose its character. She reminded the Council there were 100 units in
SOFA 1, which would clearly help with the foot traffic and retail and
Downtown areas.

SUBSTITUTE TO SUBSTITUTE MOTION:                 Vice Mayor Beecham
moved, seconded by Kleinberg, that the motion be taken for the base
floor area and not the entire bonus floor area, which will state the base
Floor area ration for RT-35 to be 1.15 FAR and for RT-50 it would be
1.5 FAR.

Council Member Kleinberg said the RT-35 numbers were fine but not
the RT-50. The Council was adopting a base density in RT-50 that BAE
said would not work. She thought what was suggested was 1.5 FAR
up to 1.7 FAR, which would be a good compromise.

Council Member Lytle said there were some unit estimates based on
BAE’s advise. It put the spread at 120 units if the highest assumptions
were used. If a 1.15 FAR were used, it would be 90 units. The Council
should have discussed splitting four units between those two ends.
She asked whether 1.5 FAR would be a breaking point with an
estimate for a 90-unit yield under 1.15 FAR throughout the area and
with a 1.5 FAR to 2.1 FAR there be a 120-unit yield. She suggested a
compromise between a 40-unit split.

Mr. Emslie said the economic analysis at the break-even point did not
include any public benefits in addition to the economics quoted
previously in the report. Secondly, the number staff provided in the
responses were not based on any feasibility as it was a gross number
and was a basic holding capacity of the area. The numbers were much
higher than would actually be yielded given the economics of the
district as it was currently functioning.
