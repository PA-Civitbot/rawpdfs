City Manager Benest said the City had almost doubled capital spending in
the past several years. The good news was more money had been put into
the IRF over the past few years than the $2 million commitment.

Council Member Kishimoto expressed concern about the                    City's
retiree/medical issue, which potentially had a $93 million liability.

Council Member Burch said the City was sobered by the current economic
state and what was yet to be revealed from the State of California. On a
positive note was the ability to respond to that type of condition. The City's
resources and reserves were good.

MOTION PASSED 8-0, Beecham absent.
