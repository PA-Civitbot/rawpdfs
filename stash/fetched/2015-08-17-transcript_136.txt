Council Member Questions, Comments and Announcements

Mayor Holman: There were going to be a couple of reports. David, do you
have our image? There were going to be a couple of reports, but if you
don't mind, we could hold those until next time. This seemed to be an
appropriate way to end tonight's meeting. Although, it's a little late now to
try to do this.

Adjournment: The meeting was adjourned at 1:29 A.M.
