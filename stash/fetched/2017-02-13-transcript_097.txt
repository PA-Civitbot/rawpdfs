Mayor Scharff: It's 18.30.035, and which one?

Council Member Fine: It's "A" and "C," 18.30A and 18.30C, C.035.

Vice Mayor Kniss: Middle of the Page 430, right?

Council Member Fine:     18.30A.035 on Page 430 and 18.30C.035 on Page
431. 432, sorry.

Council Member Filseth: I don't see an 035. I see (inaudible).

Vice Mayor Kniss: Middle of the page, design standards?

Council Member Fine: Yes. The "A" is for the overall district, and the "C" is
for when it's combined with, I think, one of the other zones.

Council Member Filseth: I don't think I'll accept it. I think we should discuss
it. If you get a second, we can do that.

Council Member Tanaka: I'll second.

AMENDMENT: Council Member Fine moved, seconded by Council Member
Tanaka to add to the Motion, “remove Sections 18.30(A).055 and
18.30(C).035.”

Mayor Scharff: Seconded by Council Member Tanaka. You want to speak to
your Motion?

Council Member Fine: Just as I spoke earlier, there were a number of folks
from the public and property owners here who expressed concern this was
overly prescriptive and would harm some of their retail success.

Mayor Scharff: Council Member Tanaka.

Council Member Tanaka: Kind of the same thing. Retail is changing a lot.
It's signage that matters a lot more these days. It could be digital displays;
it could be interactive things you could use. It's hard to predict where retail
is going to be headed. (inaudible) insist that's going to be glass no matter
what is just not really thinking too long term.

Mayor Scharff: Council Member Holman.

Council Member Holman: I won't be supporting these Amendments. All you
have to do is walk around Downtown, especially Downtown, and see how
many dark windows there are or even papered up windows there are. What
retail likes is retail. If you have blank windows, blacked out windows,
