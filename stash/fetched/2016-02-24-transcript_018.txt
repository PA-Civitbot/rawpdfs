  2016 STATE OF THE CITY ADDRESS

Chinese and there are several out there, but this is the one that they
selected. And I thought it was wonderful.

So I think this really epitomizes what we are as a community, the group of
people that we have here and all of our friends and neighbors and really the
challenges that we have after we’ve had in recent years real struggles
figuring out how are we going to recalibrate to be able to retain the quality
of life that we really value here and yet look forward, not back. And I think
that we had that opportunity to do so, but it’s going to take all of us working
together to do this and I just want to thank all of you before I sign off we’re
going to have a special treat which is or right after I sign off. If everybody
will take their, stay in their seats after I wrap up we’re going to have an
ensemble of melodies from the Palo Alto Children’s Theatre who is going to
give us a performance. But I just want to say thank you to everyone for
caring enough about your community to come out tonight. We do have
some really good food afterward so that’s part of the hook, but thank you all
for caring so much about this community and for joining us and I hope
everyone will stay and have a goal of meeting ten people that they never
knew before and you’re all here together and socializing. There’s no drink,
but we’re still sociable animals. So thank you all very much and let’s
welcome the Palo Alto Theatre Children’s Theatre.

[Live performance]

Mr. Burt: Thank you all again for coming and enjoy.
