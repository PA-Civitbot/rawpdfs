Council Member Klein asked if there was an idea of the estimated cost to
convert the pathways and he asked where the funds would come from.

Mr. Roberts stated the funds for that portion of the project would need to
come from the General Fund or the Park Impact Fees.

Interim Director of Community Services, Greg Betts stated there was
currently a CIP for Open Space Trails which was used for the maintenance of
the current forty-five miles of trails in the Open Space Parks. He stated
those same funds were being used for Phase I of Byxbee Park. He stated the
estimated cost would be $10 to $15 thousand annually for trail maintenance,
the cost for changing from maintenance roads to hiking trails was dependant
upon the materials chosen.

Council Member Klein asked the amount received annually for the CIP Fund.

Mr. Betts stated the amount ranged from $105 thousand to $165 thousand
depending on the projects occurring during that year.

Council Member Klein clarified in acceptance of this Colleagues Memo there
was a commitment to utilize more than half of one yearsâ€™ worth of the trails
budget.

Mr. Betts stated yes.

Council Member Barton asked the extent to which the two items were in
conflict with one another.

Mr. Betts stated Staff had not found conflict between the design being
reviewed for necessary restructure work and the location of the trails for
Open Space.

Council Member Burt asked whether the intent was to use trail maintenance
funds to convert new pathways.

Mr. Betts stated the CIP for Open Space Trails was intended for both, the
ongoing maintenance, repair, erosion prevention and the building of trails.

Council Member Burt asked whether the Fund had sufficient monies to
complete the intended purpose.

Mr. Betts stated there were funds available although to utilize them for this
project meant deferral of other projects.
