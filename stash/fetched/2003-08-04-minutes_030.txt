PUBLIC HEARINGS

24.   Public Hearing: The City Council will consider a report and assessment
      for weed abatement

Mayor Mossar asked the City Clerk if any objections had been received.

City Clerk Donna Rogers replied no written objections had been received.

Mayor Mossar asked if there was anyone who wished to be heard.

Mayor Mossar declared the Public Hearing open and hearing no requests to
speak declared the Public Hearing closed at 10:37 p.m.

Council Member Lytle said when the soil was tilled around the Stanford dish
for weed abatement purposes; another foot of soil erosion went into the
creeks. She asked for weed abatement notification and Fire Department
early notification include comments on how mowing was a better technique
than tilling and could be used as an option.

Council Member Kleinberg would not participate at that point due to a
potential conflict of interest because one of the assessments was against
Stanford and her husbandâ€™s former law firm represented Stanford in land use
matters.

Mayor Mossar stated she would not participate at that point due to a conflict
of interest because her husband was employed by Stanford University.

Ms. Furth said it might not have a significant impact on a corporation the
size of Stanford.

Mayor Mossar and Council Member Kleinberg said they would participate.

MOTION: Council Member Morton moved, seconded by Burch, to approve
the staff recommendation to hear and consider objections from affected
property owners of proposed assessments related to completed weed
abatement work and approve and/or modify the assessments for weed
abatement.
