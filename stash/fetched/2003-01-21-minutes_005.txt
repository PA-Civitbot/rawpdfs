CONSENT CALENDAR

Mayor Mossar announced that Consent Calendar Item Nos. 3 and 4 were
removed at the request of staff.

LEGISLATIVE

Council Member Kleinberg questioned why it was necessary to remove the
two items from the Consent Calendar for additional research.

Assistant City Manager Emily Harrison said questions from Council Members
on both items were extensive and, in some cases, requested surveying
information from other cities that could not be completed in one day.

Council Member Kleinberg asked how much research time was required.

Ms. Harrison said she had not consulted with the Utilities Director on the
Western Area Power Administration (WAPA) item but would need
approximately 15 to 20 hours on the Golf Management Contract.

Council Member Kleinberg asked if it was staff’s judgment that research was
germane to the deliberative process or did staff feel the staff report was
sufficient.

Ms. Harrison said staff felt the Council Members’ questions were germane to
their deliberative process.
