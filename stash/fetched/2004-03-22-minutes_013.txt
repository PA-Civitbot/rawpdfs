 Stephen Roberts, 309 Kipling Street, said the quality of his life had
 improved with traffic calming.

 Nick Warner, 275 Hawthorne Avenue, said he was pleased with the traffic-
 calming plan and did not believe the barriers had created a gated
 community.

 Richard Burton, 390 Palo Alto Avenue, said over the past twenty years, the
 cut-through traffic in the neighborhood had increased.

 Gregory Meyer, 979 Amarillo Avenue, said closing the streets in Downtown
 to motorists opened them to bicyclists and pedestrians.

 Kathleen Rotow, 789 University Avenue, said citywide measures and not a
 political process should reduce the traffic.

 Chas Pavlovic, 602 Hawthorne Avenue, said implementing the Modified
 Mixed Measures Plan could solve the traffic problems.

 Katherine Abu-Romia, 525 Hawthorne Avenue, said the traffic should be
 removed from the residential streets and put on the arterial streets.

 Kat Kohlsaat, 331 Poe Street, #7, said prior to traffic calming, the
 neighborhood was congested with commuter cut-through traffic and
 overrun with speeders and stop sign runners. She supported the Modified
 Mixed Measures Plan.

 Mark Nanevicz, 228 Waverley Street, said according to the statistics and
 the numbers currently available, the traffic calming had worked.

 RECESS: 10: 30 p.m. to 10:35 p.m.

 Eric Doyle, 322 Laurel Avenue, Menlo Park, homeowner on Webster Street
 in Palo Alto, said the barriers could delay emergency vehicles, which could
 result in increased risk to life and damage of property.

 Jim Sheats, 244 Webster Street, said the barriers created a safer
 neighborhood and the quality of life had improved.

 Joshua Mogal, 429 Ruthven Avenue, said despite the increase in traffic on
 his street, he preferred the traffic calming measures.

 Dan Lorimer, 465 Hawthorne Avenue, said the compromise offered by the
 PTC was reasonable.
