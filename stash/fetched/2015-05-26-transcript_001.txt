Oral Communications

Cybele LoVuolo-Bhushan: Good evening. I'm just going to—yeah, I'm
turning this off. Briefly, I ask you to waive the $4,000 conditional permit
that is on the women's shelter that's run by the Stanford students, the Heart
and Home. Last winter they did not open. It's onerous; you should waive it.
Thank you.

Lois Salo: My name is Lois Salo, S-A-L-O. I too have the same message.
Heart and Home is a group that's doing wonderful work sheltering women.
For them to have the cost of $4,000 is very cruel, because we simply don't
have the money. These are people who are volunteers. The City should
waive that amount. Please, it's a wonderful, worthwhile endeavor.

The Council's role is to determine whether the Hearing Officer's decision, as
it might be amended by the Council, provides for a package of mitigation
