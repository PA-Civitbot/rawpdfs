City Attorney Gary Baum stated there were a number of Council Members
conflicted on various parts of the proposed budget. Therefore, the budget
had been split into a variety of different motions. The motions with conflicts
would be stated at the start of each matter.

City Manager Frank Benest presented the 2006/07 budget as recommended
by the Finance Committee. The 2006/07 budget was the second year of the
two-year budget, which was conceptually approved the prior year by the
Council. The Finance Committee held four public hearings and also
conducted a preliminary discussion on long range funding for the City’s
infrastructure. The City had a projected structural deficit of $5.2 million in
2005/06, and $3.9 million in 2006/07. If the Council had not taken action in
the prior year, which included layoffs, the City would have had a projected
deficit for the next eight years. After the elimination of the structural deficits
in 2005, the Long Range Financial Plan (LRFP) showed a projected surplus of
$1.7 million in 2006/07, with ongoing surpluses through 2011/12. Since the
recession began in 2001/02, the City reduced its expenditure base by $20
million, which included elimination of 70 positions and restructuring around
vacancies. There had been a 10 percent reduction in General Fund staffing
since 2002/03, which took the City back to the 1998/99 staffing levels in the
General Fund. The majority of the positions were in Management or
Administrative Support. Part of the strategy included expanding the span of
control. The City imposed a hiring freeze, instituted a two-tier retiree
medical program, instituted an unpaid employee furlough, refinanced the
debt on City Hall, and extended the replacement schedule for City vehicles
and equipment. Services were sold to other cities from the Water Treatment
Plant, Animal Services, and Information Technology (IT). Processes such as
purchasing, contracting procedures, and development review were
streamlined. The City ended the year with a projected $1.4 million surplus,
which staff recommended the Finance Committee allocate to the
Infrastructure Reserve (IR) with another $1 million earned in interest.
Additionally, the budget included $4.6 million from an existing transfer that
would be used to continue the commitment to the City’s infrastructure. Staff
anticipated finding an additional $3 million through expense reductions and
revenue enhancements in order to continue the Capital Program. The total
revenue was $129 million with an overall increase of approximately $2.1
million or 1.6 percent. Sales tax revenues increased slowly at approximately
$1.1 million, which was a 5.6 percent increase. Property taxes showed a
$2.1 million increase or 11.7 percent. The increase in the Utility Users Tax
(UUT) was approximately $900,000 or a 10.4 percent increase. Other
revenues increased by approximately $600,000, which was a one percent
increase. Total General Fund expenses were $127.5 million, which was an
overall increase of $2.2 million or a 1.7 percent increase. Some increases
included the elimination of a one-time budget reduction strategy. IT
allocated costs were increased to their actual level. Some expense increases
were due to Workers’ Compensation costs and negotiated salaries. There
