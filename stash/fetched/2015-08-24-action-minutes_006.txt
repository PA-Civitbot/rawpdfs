Council Member Burt reported the Mayoral appointments of himself and
Council Member DuBois to the Joint Recycled Water Advisory Committee, a
collaborative effort with Santa Clara Valley Water District to explore potential
direction and capital investment in potable and non-potable water recycling
opportunities. The Committee tentatively approved expanding to include
additional partner agencies including the Regional Water Quality Control
Plant. Council Member Burt was selected as Committee Chair.

Council Member Kniss reported the success of new signage at the
intersections of Everett Avenue at Middlefield Road and Hawthorne Avenue
at Middlefield Road.       Traffic enforcement at these intersections has
generated numerous citations.       Approximately six accidents have been
reported at these intersections. She hopes that recent activity near the
traffic signals at Palo Alto High School is related to traffic signal
synchronization improvements. Santa Clara County has not made significant
progress towards traffic signal synchronization improvements along Oregon
Expressway.
