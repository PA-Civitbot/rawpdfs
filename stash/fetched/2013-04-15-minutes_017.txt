Vice Mayor Shepherd inquired whether including policy changes would be
complicated.

Mr. Aknin did not believe it would be complicated. Staff would work through
the ARB, PTC, and Council, and then incorporate changes into the different
documents.

Vice Mayor Shepherd asked if that work would delay the Comprehensive
Plan.

Mr. Aknin did not believe so.

Vice Mayor Shepherd inquired whether the Council should consider other
components from the Grand Boulevard Design Guidelines.

Mr. Aknin indicated sidewalks and architecture were the two main
components. Another component could be setback standards for buildings.
Other cities adopted similar guidelines for buildings along El Camino Real
and other commercial thoroughfares, and Staff could review those.

Vice Mayor Shepherd asked if Staff could review other cities' standards
within the context of the current Motion.

Mr. Aknin responded yes.

Vice Mayor Shepherd would support the Motion with the understanding that
Staff would review standards from other cities.

Council Member Burt stated the Colleague's Memo was consistent with the
Comprehensive Plan; however, zoning rules were arguably inconsistent with
the Comprehensive Plan. Recent building designs were not a good reflection
of New Urbanism.

Mayor Scharff thanked Council Member Holman for her initiative with the
Colleague's Memo.

MOTION PASSED: 9-0
