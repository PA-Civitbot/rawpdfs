Council Member Burt clarified the EIR had been postponed and pushed out
for a year and a half according to HSR’s current schedule. He said there was
disagreement between the Eshoo, Simitian, and Gordon’s proposal and HSR
Authority’s intentions. The HSR’s EIR would cover the first and second
phase. The Eshoo, Simitian, and Gordon’s proposal had one phase and
limited to 2-tracks. He said Mr. van Ark was at a recent Senator Simitian
Committee meeting and Senator Simitian clarified that Proposition 1-A did
not stipulate a requirement for a 4-track system or an EIR that studied a 4-
track system.

Council Member Schmid asked if a consultant was doing a study regarding
impacts to the City.

Council Member Klein said there were several consultants and an analysis
was being done on how a 4-track configuration would have financial impacts
to businesses and residents.

Council Member Schmid asked when the analysis would be available.

Mr. Emslie said it would be available in a couple of weeks.

Council Member Klein said a trial was schedule in late August regarding a
plaintiff in the litigation with concerns of the adequacy of the EIR.

Council Member Holman needed clarification on the HSR Committee wanting
to look into an EIR for portions of the project.

Mr. Emslie clarified the HSR wanted to analyze the phase implementations
for the San Jose to San Francisco segment regarding impacts on 2-track and
4-track usage as ridership increased.

Council Member Holman asked if the CCRC was meeting monthly instead of
bi-monthly.

Mr. Emslie said that was correct.

Council Member Holman followed up on Council Member Klein’s comment
regarding the CCRC reporting to the Council on quarterly basis.     She
questioned why meetings could not be monthly if reports were short.

Council Member Klein said because it was not the best use of the
Committee’s time unless there was an emergency.
