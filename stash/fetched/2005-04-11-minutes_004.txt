CONSENT CALENDAR

Carrie Manley, 764 Marion Avenue, spoke regarding Item No. 6 and urged
the Council to support Measure A.

Council Member Freeman stated she would not participate in Item No. 6 due
to a conflict of interest because of Government Code Section 1090, as she
was employed as a substitute teacher with the Palo Alto Unified School
District (PAUSD).
