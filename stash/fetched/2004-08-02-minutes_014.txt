INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER that the EIR include feasible alternative sites
outside of the Baylands.

Vice Mayor Burch asked if he were correct in understanding the SMaRT
Station would not be replicated in Palo Alto.

Mr. Roberts said there were substantial differences between the SMaRT
Station and what was envisioned for the future facility at the ESC. The
SMaRT Station became operational in 1993 and did not represent the same
concept that staff advocated. The future vision was a next generation
technology with a lead certified building to be environment-friendly. The
SMaRT Station processed 1,500 tons per day of solid-waste, and the future
ESC would handle 350 tons per day or approximately one-quarter or one-
fifth of activity the SMaRT station handled.

Vice Mayor Burch said resource reduction was critical. The City was doing
everything it could to educate the citizens on resource reduction and how to
cut back on waste. He supported the main motion.

Council Member Kleinberg asked what amount of parkland in the Baylands
was the City giving up for the site.

Mr. Roberts said he did know.

Council Member Kleinberg addressed passive recreational use and asked
whether it limited the EIR analysis since it had assumed having only passive
recreational use.

Mr. Baum said it could limit the analysis.

Council Member Kleinberg asked whether the language needed to be
changed in order to broaden the analysis.

Mr. Baum said the word “passive” could be dropped but was not sure of the
direction of her question.

Council Member Kleinberg said there were several envisioned possibilities for
recreational usage in the Baylands that could or could not be done because
of landfill in terms of active recreation. She did not want the EIR to preclude
those types of possible actions.

Mr. Baum suggested changing the word “passive” to “recreation.”
