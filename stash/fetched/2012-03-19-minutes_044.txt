Council Member Burt explained the Motion was a clear statement that the
Council wanted to pursue this.

Vice Mayor Scharff was concerned about the growing number of items on
Agendas.

Council Member Price stated another intent was to have Staff explore
opportunities for potential funding. She found Council discussions insightful,
but felt there was no action without a Motion. She wanted to ensure that this
would be a potential project with sufficient Council support.

Vice Mayor Scharff asked Staff to respond.

Mr. Williams thought Staff could commit to providing the Council with
information, either through an Information Report or Staff contact, on the
process within 90 days, so that Council could decide whether to have a public
discussion.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to have the item return as an Informational Item.

Council Member Price stated the Council could not take an action on an
Informational Item.

Council Member Holman asked if it returned as an Informational Item, how
did the Council vote on bringing it back.

Council Member Burt thought that could be done, it would be in the Packet
and at the end of the meeting the Council had the ability to agendize items.

MOTION PASSED: 9-0
