Mr. Roberts said $14.26 was an estimate based on the potential inflationary
increases of 3 percent per year. The sunset clause was structured to return
to the current $4.25 per residence per month at the end of 12 years.

Council Member Freeman said there was approximately $883,000 per year in
maintenance in the plan, and $500,000 per year would be spent on storm
drain infrastructure repair.

Mr. Roberts said maintenance was the cleaning of the lines, which included
removal of sediment, debris and leaves. Repairs were refurbishing
deterioration of the lines.

Council Member Freeman asked whether the two values were higher than
what was currently budgeted.

Mr. Roberts said it was approximately $100,000 per year increase in
maintenance and $500,000 per year increase in repairs.

Council Member Freeman asked whether there were Proposition 218 issues
when fees were collected in areas where there were no direct benefits.

Mr. Baum said it was consistent with Proposition 218. There was a concept
of Citywide benefits.

Council Member Freeman said she had concerns that the Rate Stabilization
Reserve had been removed and suggested it be included in the solution.

Mr. Roberts said it would take an increase of another dollar to include a Rate
Stabilization Fund.

Mr. Yeats said in order to establish a Rate Stabilization Reserve, a    policy
would need to state the low and high parameters.

Council Member Freeman said there was a General Fund distribution issue.
It was important to have a reserve.

AMENDMENT: Council Member Freeman moved, seconded by Kishimoto,
to increase the proposed rate increase by $1 for the specific purpose of
establishing a Reserve Fund.

Council Member Morton asked whether the fee could be adjusted in the
future.

Mr. Roberts said a formal action would need to return on December 6, 2004,
for Councilâ€™s approval to set parameters of the election.
