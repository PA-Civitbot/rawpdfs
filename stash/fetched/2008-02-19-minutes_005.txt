permanent preservation of the historic structures on the property in
exchange for the subdivision and the ability for the property to be sold to
individual owners.

Jim Baer stated staff was correct in that the Planning and Transportation
Commission arrived at the unanimous approval subject to one abstention.

Margo Schmidt, 449 Addison Ave., stated the property and homes on it were
such that preserving their historic reference was imperative.

Martin Bernstein, Chair of the Historic Resource Board requested a correction
to the Ordinance language in section 2, paragraph D, paragraph I, in the last
sentence should read “for the benefit” instead of “of the benefit.

Beth Bunnenberg, 2351 Ramona Street, spoke regarding the off-street
parking and advocated the covenant as a great preservation tool.

programs for preserving the history of Palo Alto.
