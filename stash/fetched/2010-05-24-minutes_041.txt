Council Member Klein stated concern for the lack of cost information for
sound walls and the three construction options.

Mr. Young stated the cost for sound walls varied by height or depth, and the
construction costs had been provided by the HSRA without detailed
explanation of what was included in the costs.

Council Member Klein stated in an effort to provide accurate information
there needed to be an examination of the costs that were not presently
specified. He asked whether the Palo Alto High School had been taken into
consideration in the Alternatives Analysis.

Mr. Young stated the high school had yet to be considered in relation to
where it sits with the proposed Alternatives Analysis.

Council Member Klein stated the School District was concerned that seventy-
five percent of the campus would be negatively affected.

Council Member Schmid asked the basis for not carrying forward the deep
tunnel option into South Palo Alto.

Mr. Young stated in the planning profile sheets there was no deep tunnel
option being considered for South Palo Alto. The tunnel would end just south
of Oregon Expressway.

Council Member Schmid stated in reviewing the Preliminary Alternatives
Analysis Report the City of Mountain View was shown as having a range of
options.

Mr. Young stated he did not believe the City of Mountain View had a deep
tunnel option.

Council Member Schmid stated the Alternative Analysis had presented the
deep tunnel option at a visible cost lower then a cut and cover or trench.

Mr. Young stated the HSRA presentation was misleading; the tunnel option
did not continue beyond Oregon Expressway, it was continued as open cut.

Council Member Schmid stated there had been public handouts regarding
options and asked the purpose of the information.

Mr. Young stated the schematics could be misleading if read by a party not
familiar with schematic drawings.
