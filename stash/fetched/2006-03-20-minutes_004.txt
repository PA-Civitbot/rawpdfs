Kishimoto, to approve Consent Calendar Items Nos. 1 through 5.

preferred the Council not spend City money on a project that would only
benefit a few members of the community. She would rather the money be
spent on additional restrooms at the various City parks.

agreed the park development fees could be better spent on new restrooms
or artificial turf and was opposed to installing lights at the tennis courts, as it
would have a negative impact on the quality of life in the neighborhood and
was a large expense for the few it served.
