Mayor Shepherd understood stakeholder groups disagreed about the use of
Measure E property. She inquired whether there was any consensus from
stakeholder groups regarding how the land was considered now that the City
could utilize it for these facilities.

Mr. Bobel indicated there were several stakeholder groups, and he met with
each individually.

Mayor Shepherd asked if stakeholder groups had come to terms with use of
the 10 acres.

Mr. Bobel did not see consensus yet.        Staff drafted the alternative
recommendations when they realized there was no consensus. People
opposed to use of Measure E land in any form were vehemently opposed to
alternative recommendations. The Staff recommendation was the best
chance for a compromise.

Mayor Shepherd asked if the Council should discuss that and provide
direction to Staff.

Mr. Bobel did not have a suggestion for the Council.

Mr. Keene advised that the 10 acres was never a certainty. There seemed
to be some agreement about not using the slope portion of the 10 acres.
The current discussion seemed to focus on limiting the use of the 10 acres to
the 3.8-acres portion.

Mr. Bobel noted the leadership of proponents stated that alternate
recommendations were acceptable. He had seen progress on narrowing the
use of the 10 acres.

Mayor Shepherd remarked that accepting proposals would determine the
Council's view of the 10 acres.

Mr. Keene indicated Staff's practice had been to reclaim and return different
portions of the 10 acres to the park. Staff would share an interest in
defining boundaries as soon as possible in order to complete park
components.
