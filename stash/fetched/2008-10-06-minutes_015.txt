Vice Mayor Drekmeier stated he was in support of the motion in that it was a
better proposal than years prior and that high-speed rail is the one viable
long-term option.

Council Member Kishimoto supported the bond measure, and states that any
real issues on how this affects the peninsula are out ahead of this decision.

Council Member Espinosa supported the measure and spoke to starting talks
sooner rather than later on whether or not Palo Alto would want a station.
He stressed the need to keep the community informed and the need for
early planning and study.

Council Member Schmid stated he would support the Motion, but also
discussed concerns over how high-speed rail will affect their area which has
long been comprised of smaller networks and hubs within an automobile
infrastructure and framework. He was also interested in the possibility of
underground rail. Long-distance he felt rail was a competitive element but
in the short-rail system, he felt it was more of a detriment.

Council Member Morton stated support in the Measure in the hope that it
would solve transportation issues in the west Bay Area, and hoped there
would be enough money to support Caltrains and other systems.

Council Member Burt supported the Motion, and stated raised issues could
be handled at future Study Sessions.

Mayor Klein was in support of the Measure, seeing it as a step forward for
Palo Alto.
