City Attorney Gary Baum said under the recently adopted ordinance for
streamlining of planning matters, an item would require three votes to
remove it from the Consent Calendar. The next step would be to direct staff
to set the matter for a public hearing.

City Manager Frank Benest said the discussion was whether or not the
Council would like to hear the item in a full public hearing.

MOTION PASSED 4-5, Cordell, Freeman, Kishimoto, Kleinberg yes. (Motion
passed according to Section 18.77.060(f) of the Palo Alto Municipal Code,
which requires three votes.)

Council Member Freeman stated she would not participate in Item No. 4 due
to a conflict of interest because of Government Code Section 1090, as she
was employed as a substitute teacher with the Palo Alto Unified School
District (PAUSD).

Council Member Freeman registered a no vote on Item No. 1.

MOTION: Council Member Morton moved, seconded by Kleinberg, to
approve Consent Calendar Item Nos. 1, 2 and 4.
