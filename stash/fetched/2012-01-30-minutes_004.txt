Mr. Perez clarified if the City switched to a 30-year open amortization for
Fiscal Year 2012 the reduction in the ARC would be $280,000 or $196,000
for the General Fund. For Fiscal Year 2013, the number would be $470,000
citywide or $329,000 for the General Fund. The Rate of Return discussed in
November for Fiscal Year 2012 and 2013 was 7.75 percent and forward
there were three choices; the highest rate available was 7.61 percent, 7.06
percent, and 6.39 percent. Staff had recommended the City use 7.61
percent with an adjustment for adverse deviation which lowered the
percentage to 7.25. This was the return used for Fiscal Year 2013. If the
number used remained at 7.61 percent the ARC would be $570,000 citywide
with the General Fund being $399,000; 70 percent of the contribution was a
General Fund obligation. If there was a change to a 30-year rolling
amortization with a higher rate of return assumption of 7.61 percent it would
lower the General Fund annual required obligation by $728,000. The Rate of
Return was 3.62 percent to the positive since its inception in March of 2008
through December of 2011. Staff intended to return to Council at Mid-Year
for a discussion on options to fully fund the ARC and to locate solutions to
fund the ARC on an ongoing basis beginning with Fiscal Year 2013 which
meant increasing the budget by $3.7 million citywide or $2.3 million in the
General Fund in Fiscal Year 2012 and an additional $800,000 citywide or
$500,000 for the General Fund.

Council Member Klein made note that the non-required ARC was absorbing
ten percent of the budget which appeared to be freezing out expenditures
that may be better for the health of the community long-term. He asked if
the goal of the Consultant was to choose the most conservative assumption.

Mr. Bartel said that was incorrect. The information his firm provided was
their educated speculation. They did not feel the assumptions provided were
the most conservative but were not the most aggressive either. He noted
CalPERS selected the ranges and the firm had a choice from their provided
percentages. CalPERS had a significant amount of equity invested in the
Global Equity market which was volatile.

Council Member Klein asked if there was a standard in the Actuarial Field as
to which amortization approach was approved or required.

Mr. Bartel said some Actuaries had used the Government Accounting
Standards Board (GASB) accounting standard as the out of bounds marker
for the minimum contribution that could be paid. If that was the approach
taken, from an accrual standpoint, there should not be an amortization
period longer than 30-years. He believed if a client was pre-funding and
they had a goal of paying their un-funded liability off, using an open or
rolling amortization period did not meet that objective. If the objective was
to pay the minimum that the GASB accounting standard allowed without
