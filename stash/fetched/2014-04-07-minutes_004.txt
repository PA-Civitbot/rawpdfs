hearing, walking people.

William Ross raised the issue of availability of materials regarding the
Mayfield housing hearing before the Architectural Review Board (ARB) on
March 20, 2014. He suggested the Council direct Staff to reschedule the
hearing as there was a violation of the Brown Act. The public was not
provided with the same documents as the decision-making body.

Council Member Holman requested clarification regarding conditions not
being made available to the public.

Mr. Ross indicated proposed conditions to be heard by the ARB at the
hearing were not available to the public through the website. There was a
violation of the Brown Act resulting in prejudice.
