Council Member Morton supported the motion.

MOTION PASSED 9-0.

13A. (Old Item No. 11A) 2957 Waverley Avenue: Application by Chuck
     Bradley for a Partial Refund of Development Impact Fees Paid in
     November 2002 on a Second Residential Unit Constructed in
     Conjunction with a Replacement Home

Council Member Mossar explained the item was removed to give Council the
opportunity to discuss Mr. Bradley’s request. She felt that Mr. Bradley’s
situation was caught up in an ordinance change and was not Council’s intent
to disadvantage a property owner. Mr. Bradley was owed the refund.

Council Member Kleinberg said she found the issue to be a matter of policy,
equity, and fairness.

Chuck Bradley, 2957 Waverley Street, summarized his letter to Council,
dated February 20,2004, Attachment C, to staff report (CMR173:04). He
said the situation could have been avoided if staff had properly informed him
of the amount due and when.

Planning and Environmental Director Steve Emslie said staff had no
comments.

MOTION: Council Member Kleinberg moved, seconded by Mossar, to
approve the request by Chuck Bradley for a partial refund of development
impact fees at 2957 Waverley Avenue.

Council Member Cordell asked how many properties were affected by the
same situation and if the motion were approved would they automatically be
entitled to a refund.

Acting City Attorney Bill Mayfield said the motion would apply to Mr. Bradley
and should signal the Council’s intent or concern to the other properties.
There were legal concerns about the implementation of the refund process
and asked staff be given the opportunity to report back to Council on how
the process would be implemented.

Council Member Cordell asked how many property owners would be affected
and what was the total amount of the refund.

Mr. Emslie said it was five with a total refund amount of $17,000.
