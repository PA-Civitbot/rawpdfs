recommendation to be clear to Staff.     Does that make sense?        You look
confused.

Council Member DuBois: Yeah. Can you clarify what you mean?

Council Member Scharff: Yeah. In the Staff Report, it says that ...

Mayor Holman: Can you give us the page please?

Council Member Scharff: On page 1 under Item 2, it was issue Request for
Proposals, RFP, to add dedicated wireless facilities to improve
communications for Public Safety and Utility Departments. That's what we
just added in. Then it says with an option for expanding Wi-Fi coverage at
City facilities and public areas. We should do the same RFP. When we do
the RFP, we should it once. We should add those options in for Staff. I
mean, I'll ask Staff, but that was clearly there intention. It seemed if we're
going to do, we might as well do it the way they wanted to.

Mr. Reichental: To get a proposal, like how much it would cost but not the
(inaudible) just have the costs?

Council Member Scharff: Right.

Mr. Reichental: That's what we were intending to do in that case.

Council Member Scharff: That's what I think you should do, because we're
already asking you to evaluate sending it to retail areas.

Council Member DuBois: Are you saying that the RFP should include retail
areas before we evaluate them?

Council Member Scharff: No. I'm asking Staff when they do their RFâ€”are
you doing an RFP or an RFI? You're doing an RFP.

Mayor Holman: (crosstalk)

Mr. Reichental: (crosstalk)

Council Member Scharff: Originally you had options for expanding, so I took
that as an informational process because it's options. What was Staff's
intention on this?
