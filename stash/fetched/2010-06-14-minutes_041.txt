Council Member Holman: Just to support and appreciate Council Member
Priceâ€™s raising this issue. Appreciate that it looks like there are some
opportunities to forward. My anticipation is the further we get into this
process and the longer the DEIR has been out there the more public
comments that we are going to get. That kind of traditionally is what
happens. So I appreciate we have some opportunities to hear from the
public earlier and make more accommodation for that.
