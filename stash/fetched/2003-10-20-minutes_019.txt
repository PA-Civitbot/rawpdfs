Interior’s standards must be met in order to be compatible with the SOFA 2
Coordinated Area Plan (CAP). The SOFA 2 CAP presented three findings
which would not include demolition.

Council Member Kleinberg asked for Staff’s recommendation about the
preservation of the locations Council Member Ojakian referred; the Wilbur
property, 780 High Street and 111 Homer Avenue.

Senior Planner Virginia Warheit said Pringle Gas Station was on the eligible
building national register. The Wilbur property building on the corner of
Homer Avenue and High Street was an early Birge Clarke auto showroom
that had been on the City’s historic inventory for many years.

Council Member Freeman said there was a potential for high-density over-
variance property at 800 High Street and a storage building across the
street.

Council Member Kishimoto said 780 High Street was not on the historic list.
The historic preservation was important because of the attraction of the area
and the value added to the landowners and investors.

Council Member Ojakian asked staff the extent of area rezoned to RT-50.

Ms. Grote said the block was removed as RT-50 because of consistency
along Homer Avenue.

Council Member Ojakian said he believed Council removed it.

Council Member Lytle commented about the historic integrity of the historic
resource list from staff.

Council Member Ojakian said housing would be allowed whether the area
was RT-35 or RT-50.

Management Specialist Jon Abendschein, City Attorney’s Office, said two
sections were removed from RT-50 at the City Council Meeting of August 2,
2003.

Council Member Freeman asked if the Spanish-style Palo Alto Bimmer
garage was included.

Vice Mayor Beecham said it did not include anything on Homer Avenue.

it being historic.

Vice Mayor Beecham historic buildings had preservation requirements not
