     Partnership Presentation.

Michael Closson, Executive Director of Acterra presented a brief history of
the relationship between the City of Palo Alto and Acterra. In 1984, the City
adopted the Conceptual Master Plan for the Pearson Arastradero Preserve.
The plan called for entering into a contract with a Steward (a non-profit,
local community based organization) to help maintain the preserve -
specifically looking at habitat restoration, removal of non-native weeds, and
educational opportunities. The City has enjoyed a successful stewardship
agreement with Acterra for 14 years (Started as Bay Area Action in April
1997). Last year Acterra propagated and planted over 17,000 native plants
with over 2,000 hours of volunteers. He spoke about Acterra’s current
activities associated with the City of Palo Alto which includes the
Green@Home Program, Stewardship Program, Nature hikes, and
Environmental Education.
