      Continued Use of the Building to Provide Senior Services.

Lalo Perez, Chief Financial Officer, reported Staff requested the Council
approve a 50-year lease with Avenidas. Staff issued notice on July 18 and
25, 2014 and November 7 and 14, 2014 in the Palo Alto Weekly. As
required, Staff notified owners of property located within 300 feet of the site.

Public Hearing opened at 7:49 P.M.

approve the new long-term lease with Avenidas. He was confident La
Comida could work with Avenidas through the planning process to arrive at a
plan that met the needs of both organizations.

Herb Borock felt the expansion and proposed lease were one project and
should have been presented to the Council simultaneously.

Public Hearing closed at 7:53 P.M.

MOTION:       Mayor Shepherd moved, seconded by Vice Mayor Kniss to
authorize the City Manager to approve a new, fifty (50) year lease
agreement between the City of Palo Alto and Avenidas and cancel the

Mayor Shepherd was pleased Avenidas would continue its service to the
community with a modern facility.

Vice Mayor Kniss congratulated Avenidas for its plans and wished it luck in
the future.
