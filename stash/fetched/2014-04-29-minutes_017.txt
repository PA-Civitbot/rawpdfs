Council Member Burt noted the RFP would not contain the amount the City
would pay for renewable power generated from the process, and asked if
that was a concern.

Mr. Bobel explained that the current RFP utilized a base number. Staff could
specify other energy prices for proposers to analyze.

Council Member Burt inquired whether the new            RFP   would     solicit
design/bid/build proposals or design/build proposals.

Mr. Bobel reported Component 1 did not need to be private-sector owned
and operated. The same applied to wet anaerobic digestion. City owned
and operated digesters were logical. Staff wanted to lead proposers to food
scrap preprocessing, aerobic composting for yard trimmings, and possibly
the power plant for methane gas. For those three elements, Staff would
have to provide options. Staff definitely wanted to lead proposers in the
direction of third-party owner/operator.

Council Member Burt asked if Component 1 would be needed if bids provided
aggressive timelines.

Mr. Bobel believed Component 1 would always be needed, because the City
would need backup. The City would need the dewatering facility regardless
of which recommendation was approved.

Council Member Burt questioned the ability to truncate design and
construction of Components 3 and 4 in a shorter period than needed for
Component 2.

Mr. Bobel indicated those timeframes were rough estimates based on
original recommendations. If alternative recommendations were used, then
the RFP could be issued quickly. By December 2014 Staff would provide a
better timeline.

Council Member Klein expressed concern about time constraints for Council
discussion.

Mayor Shepherd expected the Council to complete the Agenda.

Council Member Klein inquired about the amount of time needed to complete
the current item.
