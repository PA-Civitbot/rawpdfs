Mr. Rodriguez stated no, until Council directed Staff they would not approach
the matter.

Council Member Klein asked whether there was private money in any of the
other bridges.

Ms. Ames said the Homer Tunnel had a contribution of $250,000 provided by
the Palo Alto Medical Foundation.

Mr. Sartor clarified the funds were a part of the Development Agreement so
they should not be considered as a donation.

Council Member Klein asked about the funding cycle for similar projects in
other cities.

Mr. Rodriguez said the timeframe was dependent on the individual project;
although, he knew the Mary Avenue Bridge was approximately four years.

Council Member Holman said the Staff report mentioned improvements to
the Benjamin Lefkowitz Bicycle and Pedestrian Undercrossing but there was
no mention for additional lighting to account for the widening of Highway
101. She asked if there was a cost estimate for adding lighting.

Mr. Sartor was uncertain of the cost for additional lighting but the original
lighting had been removed by the Utilities Department and was reinstalled
as a preliminary step to the widening of Highway 101. He believed once the
project was completed the lighting would be replaced as part of the new
structure.

Council Member Holman noted the Highway 101 overcrossing to the
Baylands was going to be a landmark for identifying Palo Alto. She inquired
as to whether Staff had given thought to holding a competition to create a
design for the project.

Mr. Sartor said if Council directed, Staff would explore that as an option
during the design phase.

Mr. Keene added a competition was an interesting idea and it could present
architectural and functional values for the City. He mentioned a bridge
created in Tuscan, Arizona where art and design were brought together to
forge an award winning project.
