ACTION ITEMS

1.    Continued Discussion of Palo Alto Transportation Demand Management
      Plan (Continued from September 16, 2013).

MOTION: Council Member Klein moved, seconded by Mayor Scharff that:

In order for the City Council to determine whether one or more Transportation
Demand Management (TDM) Districts as proposed on the Colleagues’ memorandum
or as reasonably modified would be legal, effective, practical and economic for any
or all of the University Avenue, California Avenue, East Meadow Circle and Stanford
Research Park Business District, the City Council hereby directs the City Manager
and the City Attorney as follows:

City Attorney – Advise the Council whether such TDM Districts would be legal and if
so what laws and legal procedures and processes would apply to them;

City Manager – 1) Prepare a preliminary report on the proposed TDM Districts, at a
cost of not more than $100,000 in staff time, (a) setting forth staff’s initial views on
TDM Districts, (b) outlining the steps necessary for an in-depth study of TDM
Districts and its timeline, (c) identifying any local or regional governments that
have TDM Districts comparable to that proposed in the Colleagues’ memorandum
and (d) advising whether the services of a consultant would be needed for a more
detailed, in-depth study of such proposed TDM Districts and if so what the
consultant would be expected to do and his/her expected cost.
