Council Member Questions, Comments and Announcements

Mayor Burt: Our final part of the meeting is Council Member Questions,
Comments and Announcements. Council Member Kniss.

Council Member Kniss: I know I'm not the only one who will be leaving
town, but I will be at the National League of Cities in Washington, D.C.,
starting at the very end of the week and back on Tuesday night. Delighted
to be going. I think it's going to be very interesting. This is the legislative
session, as you probably all know, to find out what's going to happen next,
particularly in transportation. It should be very interesting this year. Also,
to encourage you yet again—thank you, Mayor Burt, for signing up for bocce
ball. Don't miss bocce ball in April. It's fun, great exercise. Think of it that
way. It's also a fundraiser.

Mayor Burt: No, we certainly don't. I am in training; I've been drinking red
wine, and I'm ready to go. Is that it?

Council Member Kniss: Also next week, the Cities Association is meeting, I
believe Greg, on Wednesday night or Thursday night.

Vice Mayor Scharff: Thursday night.
