Vice Mayor Drekmeier spoke to the Motion, mindful most present in Council
would support freedom/democracy and some finding it was not in Councilâ€™s
scope to take position on international issues.
Council Member Yeh spoke to growing up in Palo Alto oblivious to world
issues; however the internet and free press keep issues readily apparent.
He cited the information given to Council by the Burmese-American
community at prior meetings, and urged Council support.

Kenneth Wong, 1280 15th Avenue #309, San Francisco, grew up in Burma,
noted reports of aid not getting through.

Barbara Slone, 2002 Barbara Drive, thanked Council Members and urged
others to join in compassionate action.

Council Member Morton urged his Colleagues to join in the cause.

Council Member Espinosa also spent time in Burma recently, but does not
believe it was of City concern. He was not in support of the Motion.

Council Member Burt expressed mixed feelings on whether it was
appropriate for the Council to take such a position on issues of no direct
impact to the city.

Mayor Klein associated himself with the remarks of Council Member
Espinosa.

Council Member Schmid stated he felt this Motion was beneficial to Palo Alto
in bringing a lesson home.
