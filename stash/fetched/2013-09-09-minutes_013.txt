Council was presented with three choices; a citizen's name, Main Library and
Rinconada Library.

Council Member Holman wanted the name to remain Main Library if an
appropriate citizen's name could not be determined.

Council Member Burt indicated the name Main Library was not distinctive.

names for rooms. The location name of Rinconada Library could be utilized
for a time until someone proposed a new name.
