REPORTS OF COMMITTEES AND COMMISSIONS

6.    From Finance Committee: Request for Council Direction Concerning
      Response to the Palo Alto Airport Working Group Report and Options
      Regarding the Future of the Palo Alto Airport

Council Member Morton stated the County intends to retreat from the
operations from the Palo Alto Airport.

Manager of Real Property Bill Fellman reviewed a slide presentation on the
airport property. He pointed out the master plan showed the airport adding
hangars on the property, although the City felt the action would be intrusive
on the Baylands.

Vice Mayor Klein asked whether the airport or the County wanted the
additional hangars.

Mr. Fellman stated to increase revenue the County suggested adding
hangars on Embarcadero Road.

Vice Mayor Klein stated the Palo Alto Airport Working Group (PAAWG) report
was based on no additional hangars.

Council Member Drekmeier asked why there was a split vote from the
Finance Committee to not start negotiations on early termination of the
lease.

Council Member Beecham stated he was not opposed to taking over the
airport operations; however, there was no business plan or economic
analysis.

Council Member Drekmeier asked whether Council Member Mossar had
concerns regarding the Creek or Army Corps of Engineers.

Council Member Beecham stated a concern of hers was the airport being
under water in the event of Global Warming events.

Council Member Barton asked if there were an option for planning to
terminate the airport and utilize the site for something else.
