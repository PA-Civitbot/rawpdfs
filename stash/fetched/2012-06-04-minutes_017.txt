16.   Public Hearing: Appeal Of An Architectural Review Approval And A
      Record Of Land Use Action Regarding the Director's Architectural
      Review Approval Of A Three Story Development Consisting Of 84
      Rental Residential Units In 104,971 Square Feet Within The Upper
      Floors, 50,467 S.F. Ground Floor Research And Development Area,
      Subterranean    And    Surface    Parking Facilities, And  Offsite
      Improvements, With Two Concessions Under State Housing Density
      Bonus Law (GC65915), and Approval of a Mitigated Negative
      Declaration, On A 2.5 Acre Parcel At 195 Page Mill Road And 2865
      Park Boulevard, * Quasi-Judicial.

Curtis Williams, Planning & Community Environment Director, noted that the
proper process was for the Appellant to speak before the Applicant on an
Appeal.

Amy French, Planning & Community Environment Acting Assistant Director,
said the Park Plaza Project was a three story mixed use building on a 2.5
acre parcel at 195 Page Mill Road and 2865 Park Boulevard. The residential
component had a Floor Area Ratio (FAR) of 1.02 to 1. The ground floor
research and development component was a .48 to 1 FAR.               The 84
residential units were rental units and included 17 Below Market Rate (BMR)
units, which was 20 percent of the total for which two concessions under
Government Code 65915 were requested.               The project included a
subterranean parking garage, surface parking lot, fountain, pedestrian
amenities along Park Boulevard, street trees, bulb-outs, and a left turn
stacking lane on Park Boulevard to access Page Mill Road. The Architectural
Review Board (ARB) recommended the current project on a 3 to 2 vote in
2011, and had recommended a similar project in 2006. On October 3, 2011
Council reviewed the project which had a tentative map included that
allowed for condominiums. The map was later withdrawn. The Council
directed the Applicant to proceed with the same project only with a rezone
request to pedestrian transit oriented development. The Applicant rejected
the rezoning, and instead requested final Council action on the quasi-judicial
                                                                        Page 17 of 47

                                                                     Minutes: 6/4/12
