                        TRANSCRIPT
tentatively approved last week, so I'm hoping we can have a single motion
to approve all of these this evening.

Mr. Rossmann: Mayor Holman, one more thing. This $80,000 for Project
Safety Net, if you could include that in the motion as well.

Mayor Holman: Yes, thank you.

Council Member Kniss: If we haven't anything else, I would move approval
of the motion you've just read, unless you prefer to keep it your motion,
Mayor Holman.

Mayor Holman: No. I'm fine with it all being one fail swoop. We need a
motion to approve.

Council Member Kniss: I moved.

Mayor Holman: We need a second.

Council Member DuBois: Second.

Mayor Holman: Motion by Council Member Kniss, second by Council Member
DuBois to approve the additions that we just lined out, "A" through "E."

MOTION:      Council Member Kniss moved, seconded by Council Member
DuBois to:

A.   Refer to the Finance Committee consideration of stronger
     encroachment fees for construction that impact portions or all of a city
     street or sidewalk; and

B.   Keep the Code Enforcement-Lead position in the Fiscal Year 2016
     Budget; and

C.   Direct Staff and the Finance Committee to return in six months with an
     update on the Animal Shelter; and

D.   Direct Staff to investigate increasing Business Registry participation up
     to and including increasing late fees; and

E.   Include an additional $80,000 for Project Safety Net.

Mayor Holman: Vote on the board. Those pass unanimously.

MOTION PASSED: 9-0
