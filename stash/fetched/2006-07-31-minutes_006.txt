To address those challenges, staff outlined an approach that consisted of a
number of ideas related to expense reduction and revenue creation over the
short-to-long-term period. Some of the ideas included implementation of a
roadway impact fee, continued restructuring and streamlining efforts, review
of service delivery and contracting options, charges for emergency sidewalk
repairs, service reduction, an increase in the transient occupancy tax, and
increased sales tax revenue.

Staff informed Council of the next steps in the process. In October, staff
would return to the Finance Committee with further discussion on the “best
bets” for expense reduction and revenue generation. Based on Council
direction, implementation would begin on the short-term options with the
other options incorporated in the 2007-09 budget process.

No action required.
