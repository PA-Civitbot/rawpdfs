library, they believed the community-at-large would be more likely to pass a
bond measure to pay for the rest.

Chris Kenrick, 528 Tennyson, concurred with the comments of Kathy Miller.

Sanford Forte, 280 College Avenue, said the City should not hold the branch
libraries hostage any longer, and believed branch library hours should be
restored.

Mayor Beecham declared the Public Hearing closed at 8:30 p.m.

RECESS: 8:30 p.m. to 8:40 p.m.

Council Member Freeman agreed with the Library Director that a change to
the library system was needed; however, she disagreed with the proposed
approach. She reviewed the Service Efforts and Accomplishments (SEA)
Report created by the City Auditor and looked at the library staffing section.
She noted in the past five years staffing had increased by 10 percent, yet
the number of residents per full time equivalent (FTE) library staff had
decreased. The number of volunteer hours had decreased by 322 or
approximately 7 percent, the total number of hours opened annually had
decreased by 2 percent, and the hours of operation per FTE had decreased
12 percent. Between 1993 and 2003, library visits were up by 5,000, items
circulated were up by 301,000, the average item circulated during a three-
year period was up by 60,000, and the reference questions had decreased
by 32,000. The number of branches went from six to five, the number of
hours opened per week was down by 46 hours, while program attendance
rose 12,000, and the collection size increased by 12,000. By closing the two
branches, 63 hours would be available; however, the staff report
(CMR:513:04) indicated the City would only get three hours in return. She
said the data did not support the notion that Palo Alto would not be able to
keep the branch libraries open. In the 2004-05 adopted capital budget, there
was approximately $4 million already earmarked for capital upgrades in the
libraries. She was not aware of any long-term financing to increase the
shuttle services to accommodate a full service library, or financing solutions
for a brand new library.

MOTION: Council Member Freeman moved, seconded by Kishimoto, for
staff, with the Library Advisory Commission (LAC) input, to return to Council
with a plan to: 1) amend the Library Master Plan to support one resource
library instead of two; 2) return with a recommendation for location of the
resource library at either Mitchell Park Library or Main Library, with the
location not chosen to remain as a branch library; 3) define the uses of
branches; 4) maintain all current branch libraries; 5) evaluate with the
PAUSD, the use of Gunn High School as a shared library facility in southwest
