Council Member DuBois: Can I just ask a question? The math that the
principal cited, I think she said they have 70 teachers. Do we sell them the
lower-wage permit?

Ms. Sullivan: Our understanding is that the teachers at Addison do not
qualify for low-wage permits.

Council Member DuBois: She said it was $15,000.

Ms. Sullivan: I believe they purchased 60 or 70â€”yeah, 60 permits total.

Council Member DuBois: For a year?

Ms. Atkinson: For Phase One, which was the six months that we're just
wrapping up now. The School District purchased them as an employer, and
employers only had access to the standard price permit. They did not have
access to a reduced price permit which was only for eligible employee
purchase.

Council Member Schmid:      How many parking spaces are there on the
Addison block?

Ms. Sullivan: I believe they have about 17. Off street?

Council Member Schmid: The block.

Ms. Atkinson: We would have to get back to you.

Ms. Sullivan: On the block, I don't know.

Council Member Schmid: There's no residences on that block, so the whole
block is parking.

Ms. Gitelman: We'd have to get back to you with a count.

Council Member Kniss: You mean on the school site, Greg?

Council Member Schmid: Yeah. Seventeen. The square block that Addison
is on doesn't have any houses.

Ms. Gitelman: One thing we could do, if you're inclined to consider their
request, we're could add something to make the Addison Elementary School
eligible for a certain number of low-income permits regardless of what their
income is.
