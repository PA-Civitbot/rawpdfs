Mr. Roberts stated yes.

Council Member Morton stated there appeared to be an economic
disincentive for zero waste when there was a fixed price for garbage and a
larger cost for recyclables.

Mr. Roberts stated the Smart Station and Kirby Canyon agreements were
entered into in the early 1980â€™s as long-term agreements meant to lock in
the future expenses and maximize capacity.

Council Member Morton asked the flexibility within the contract for shifting
out of the garbage stream and into the recycle stream.

Mr. Roberts stated the hauler would keep the revenues from recyclable
materials therefore there was a built-in incentive for them to gravitate
toward recyclables.

Council Member Schmid asked how the contractor was to assist in
mandating recycling.

Mr. Roberts stated the desire for mandating recycling was a phased-in
process. The first year would be to educate the community; the second year
would be notices sent out to the community and the third year was to
implement enforcement yet to be determined.

Council Member Schmid asked who would actually be determining what a
reusable or recyclable material was.

Manager of Solid Waste, Russell Reiserer stated the first year education
process was educating the community on what was able to be recycled, the
second year would consist of tagging the cans with a notice of recyclable
materials being located in garbage containers and the third year may consist
of not getting the cans picked up that week if there had been prior multiple
warnings.

Mr. Roberts stated the hauler assists the community by being the first level
of review.



Emily Renzel, 1056 Forest Avenue, supported the Staff recommendation.
She requested the 1.9 acres parkland be restored to parkland once the new
hauler contract takes place.
