Council Member Scharff added that if those companies built their own
network, then they would compete with Google Fiber on the City's network.
Other companies would not use the City's network even though they could.

Mr. Fleming concurred.

Council Member Scharff asked if Google had to own the network or could
simply use the network.

Mr. Reichental advised that Google would lease the network.

Mr. Fleming clarified that Google would license existing dark fiber on the
City's network and rent conduit and place their fiber huts on City-owned
property. Google's model was to collaborate as much as possible with
communities. That model was advantageous as there were assets to be
leveraged and the deployment timetable was reduced.

Council Member Scharff recalled that Sonic was interested in licensing,
leasing, and building out.

Mr. Fleming advised that Sonic wanted to build in areas where infrastructure
was available and rates were reasonable.

Council Member Scharff asked if Staff felt Google and Sonic would utilize the
network if the City built it.

Mr. Reichental agreed that was a possibility.

Mr. Fleming indicated that was the open access model, where more than one
ISP utilized the system. The implementation of open access had been very
difficult.
