Council Member Freeman requested an addition to the motion to have
staff reevaluate detail on bike and pedestrian facilities that prioritized
critical links and return to the Council with more information.

Mr. Kott said the detail was taken from the adopted Bicycle Master
Plan, which included a list of critical links.

AMENDMENT: Council Member Freeman moved, seconded by
Kishimoto, to move the priority status of the Downtown alleyways for
pedestrians and bicycle access to at least a medium priority.

Vice Mayor Beecham      said he would not accept the changes into his
original motion.

Council Member Freeman said more mid-block walkways in the
Downtown would reduce jaywalking, increase safety and create a
different transit area for pedestrian and bicycles. Interest in Downtown
Palo Alto could result for a very low cost.

Council Member Kishimoto said the Nelson Nygaard Report said the
Downtown alleyway was number one for cost benefit ranking.
Mayor Mossar asked if staff wanted to share the history of mid-block
walkways.

Mr. Kott said even though the benefit cost ratio was low, the raters felt
the overall benefit to the City did not merit the rating to a higher
category.

Mayor Mossar said the document had been looked over by Planning,
Boards and Commissions, and a consultant. The Council was a policy
setting body and must rely on staff and boards and commissions to do
the detail analysis.

Mayor Mossar called for the question on the amendment, which
required a two-thirds vote.

Ms. Furth said the call for the question on Council rules took a two-
thirds vote to end debate and proceed to the motion.

MOTION TO CALL THE QUESTION:                Council Member Freeman
moved, seconded by Lytle, to call the question.

MOTION TO CALL THE QUESTION PASSED 6-3, Kleinberg, Morton,
Mossar “no.”
