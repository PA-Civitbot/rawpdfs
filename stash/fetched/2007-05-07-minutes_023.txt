Council Member Morton stated he had major concerns that judgment would
be taken away from the officers.

Council Member Kleinberg asked to add a recommendation to the motion to
come back to Council.

Council Member Cordell stated if the motion passed, the main criteria would
be that the use of Tasers would be limited to circumstances in which lethal
force would be permitted.

Council Member Kleinberg asked whether staff was being requested to
return with an alternative tool for when lethal force was needed and would it
need to include the legal issues involved.

Council Member Cordell stated the Center at Stanford had looked into this
before.

Council Member Morton asked whether the motion was asking staff to bring
this back and set a protocol.

Council Member Cordell stated the Substitute Motion would be to authorize
the Police Department to purchase and deploy the use of Tasers, which use
would be limited to circumstances under which lethal force would also be
permitted. A protocol or policy is requested that would be supportive of that
position and then the department would come back with that protocol.

Mayor Kishimoto asked whether it would come back to the Council for one
more vote.

Council Member Cordell stated the use of Tasers would be approved and the
authorization to buy them. They would only be used where lethal force
would be permitted and it would be accompanied by a policy which
supported it.

Council Member Beecham stated he would prefer to specify the criteria and
have staff include it in the policy.

Mr. Baum suggested staff be directed to alter the policy to reflect the
Council’s desires and agreement to consult with Stanford’s Criminal Justice
Center and the Police Auditor, or any other experts on this issue, and go
ahead with the policy. The policy would not be brought back to the Council.

Council Member Beecham asked whether the motion was requiring the policy
