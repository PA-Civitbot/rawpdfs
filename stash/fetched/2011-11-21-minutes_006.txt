AGENDA CHANGES, ADDITIONS, AND DELETIONS


8c. (Former Item No. 2) Approval of a Water Enterprise Fund Contract with
    Anderson Pacific Engineering Construction, Inc. in a Total Not to Exceed
    Amount of $3,135,200 for the Seismic Upgrade of the Mayfield and
    Boronda Reservoirs WS-08002-501.


MOTION:      Council Member Klein moved, seconded by Council Member
Scharff to approve the Staff recommendation but to reduce the contingency
amount from 15 percent to 10 percent.


Council Member Klein stated that the contingency reserves should have
stricter guidelines. The Council should maintain discretion and supervision in
distributing the funds. He said a 10 percent contingency was sufficient for
smaller contracts.   The Council should be made aware of any unforeseen
complications as the project moved forward.
