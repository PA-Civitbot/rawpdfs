Mr. Keene stated if there was a desire to ensure implementation of cost of
service decisions, he did not believe 24 months was necessary. Fall of 2011
seemed ample time to allow Staff to complete the necessary steps to comply
with the Proposition 218 requirements.

Mayor Burt asked Council Member Schmid whether he was open to revising
the Amendment to 12 months.

Council Member Schmid stated no, his Amendment would stand at 9
months.

AMENDMENT FAILED DUE TO THE LACK OF A SECOND

Mayor Burt asked for clarification that multi-family residentials were being
charged more for composting than were single residences.

Ms. Eyerly stated yes. In the commercial rate structure adopted in 2009
there was an error in the rate for cart service which was corrected in the
new rate schedule. A small number of customers who had a 96-gallon or less
service inadvertently received free service.

Mayor Burt stated he was not asking about commercial.

Ms. Eyerly clarified multi-family apartments of 5 or more units were serviced
under the commercial structure.

Mayor Burt stated the multi-family units were treated as commercial
although they were an anomaly among residential.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to include 6% rate increase for mini cans.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to exempt multi-unit residential properties up to
10 units from additional composting fee.

Mayor Burt stated when the GreenWaste contract first went before Council it
was presented in great detail that bottles, cans and certain paper had and
would continue to have value. The remainder of recyclables cost money to
recycle but do not end up in the landfill.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER that the rate increase expire in 12 months
(October 1, 2011), and that Staff is to return with fully vetted costs within
the Cost Study by January 2011.
