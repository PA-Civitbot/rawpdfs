Neither the director, nor the city council on appeal, shall grant architectural

findings is met:

1.     The design is consistent with applicable elements of the Palo Alto

       “applied” appearance of design), creates an internal sense of order and
       desirable environment for occupants, visitors, and the general
       community, and preserves, respects and integrates existing natural
       features and the historic character including historic resources of the
       area when relevant; and provides harmonious transitions in size, mass,
