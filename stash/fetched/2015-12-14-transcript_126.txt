                         TRANSCRIPT
Mr. Keene: That gives us enough guidance to know how to write the RFP
within the Council's intent.

Council Member Kniss: That's what we wanted to have taken out. That left
it too loose.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to remove from Part D of the Motion, “for a
potential upper project budget of $13 to $17 million.”

Mayor Holman: Just one last thing here. As a part of this, we're ceasing
negotiations because we're going broader here. Moffatt Nichol will still be
able to participate; they'll be ... They can present and propose whatever
their scaled-back project is. I think that is it. I don't see—Council Member
Wolbach and Council Member Kniss, you're satisfied?

Council Member Kniss: We're happy.

Mayor Holman: The motion is basically to go out with an RFP to meet a
construction budget of $13 million—I'm condensing here—and to seek
additional public and private funding to support inclusion of enhancements.
That's really a compressed version; that's the abridged version. With that,
vote on the board please. That motion passes unanimously.

MOTION AS AMENDED PASSED: 9-0

Mr. Keene: (inaudible) seeing almost all of you later on today at either
Finance or Policy and Services. We'll be back in the office by 8:30 in the
morning; that's 7 1/2 hours from now.

Inter-Governmental Legislative Affairs
