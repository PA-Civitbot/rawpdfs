Council Member Wolbach: (inaudible)

Mayor Burt: You had previous comments.

Council Member Wolbach: (inaudible)

Mayor Burt: I don't know what you're saying. The project fails, and that
concludes this item.

Council Member Holman: Mayor Burt?

Mayor Burt: Yes.

Council Member Holman: Maybe it's a question for City Attorney. The
motion to approve the project failed, but it wasn't a denial of the project.
I'm just wondering—I look to the City Attorney for this ...

Mayor Burt: Good question.

Council Member Holman: ... if there could be a motion to return this to the
ARB with direction to fix the ailments of the project.

Cara Silver, Senior Assistant City Attorney: I think you have two options at
this point. You can either choose to deny the project and state your reasons
why you're denying the project or you can direct to send it back to the ARB
as you had suggested.

Mayor Burt: I will move that it is returned to the ARB with guidance to more
carefully calculate the permissible FAR and to adjust the building height and
mass to be more in alignment with the finding requirements on
compatibility.

Council Member Holman: I second that.

Mayor Burt: Second by Council Member Holman.

MOTION: Mayor Burt moved, seconded by Council Member Holman to refer
this project to the Architectural Review Board (ARB) with guidance to:

A.   More carefully calculate the permissible Floor Area Ratio (FAR); and

B.   Adjust the building’s height and mass to be more consistent with
     Compatibility Findings.

Mayor Burt: I don't need to speak further to the Motion.
