clarity and maybe have a better opportunity to determine what we should
really spend time and resources on?

Mayor Holman: Council Member DuBois? Actually it might be appropriate to
ask Staff that question.

Council Member Berman: I'd love to get Staff's thoughts, if they have any.
I guess, for Staff it would be how much time do you think that would take?

Mayor Holman: We're looking at "G" of the motion.

Council member Berman: Versus just waiting until we have more clarity
about what the situation is.

Mr. Reichental: Is the question how long it will take?

Council Member Berman: How much Staff resources would doing "G" take?
I guess, in Staff's opinion, does it make sense to do that now or wait until
the situation is a little more clear on the ground in terms of what the
different actors are planning on doing?

Mr. Reichental: I think we stand by our recommendation to wait.

Council Member Berman: What's that?

Mr. Reichental: I think we want to wait (inaudible).

Council Member Berman:      You stand by your recommendation to wait.            I

Mr. Reichental: Yes. We don't think we should do that right now.

Council Member Berman: I agree. I guess I'm looking maybe to Council
Member DuBois why it makes sense to do that now versus waiting until we
get a little more clarity about ...

Mayor Holman: Can we cut more to the chase and see if Council Member
DuBois is interested in deleting "G"?
