interest in the project. Staff could report to the Council by the time the
Resolution process was required.

Mayor Scharff asked if that was a viable option.

Mr. Williams suggested there would be time to do that before a Resolution
was required in the fall.

Mayor Scharff inquired whether there was a negative side to submitting a
grant proposal, vetting the project through the community, and then
removing it from consideration.

Mr. Rodriguez agreed more time was needed to vet the project. This project
was an opportunity for Staff to be creative, and to offer a benefit to the
community. There was time to withdraw the project before accept funding.
The project would not score well on project readiness, because of the lack of
community input.

Council Member Kniss supported removing Project Number 3 only.

Council Member Klein felt the discussion ignored public perception. The City
would not receive more than $5 million-$10 million. The City would receive
backlash from the community. The Council ought to eliminate Project
Numbers 3, 8 and 9.

Mayor Scharff called the vote on Council Member Burt's Amendment to add
Project Number 9 back to the Motion.

AMENDMENT TO AMENDMENT PASSED:                     5-4 Berman, Holman, Klein,
Schmid no

Mayor Scharff called the vote on the Amendment to remove Project Numbers
3 and 8 from the Motion.

Council Member Kniss wanted to vote separately on the two projects.

Council Member Klein stated the Chair could split the vote.

AMENDMENT SEPARATED FOR THE PURPOSE OF VOTING: Mayor
Scharff requested the Motion be bifurcated to allow separate votes for
removing identified Project Numbers 3 and 8.

AMENDMENT TO MOTION:          Council Member Klein moved, seconded by
Council Member Schmid to delete project number 8.
