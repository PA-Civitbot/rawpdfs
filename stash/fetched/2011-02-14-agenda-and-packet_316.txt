                 back to Council, at which time subject is fully debated. It requires a
                 second, is amendable, and is debatable only as to the propriety of
                 referring. The substance of the subject being referred shall not be
                 discussed at the time the motion to refer is made.

                 j) Amend or substitute. This motion changes or reverses the main
                 motion. It requires a second, is amendable, and is debatable only
                 when the motion to which it applies is debatable. A motion to amend
                 an amendment is in order, but one to amend an amendment to an
                 amendment is not. An amendment modifying a motion is in order
                 but an amendment raising an independent question or one that is not
                 germane to the main motion shall not be in order. Amendments take
                 precedence over the main motion and the motion to postpone
                 indefinitely.
