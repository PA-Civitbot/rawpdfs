Vice Mayor Kniss would not support the Amendment. The City was losing
money every day it did not collect tax revenues.

Mayor Shepherd understood the topic was included in the Policy and
Services Committee's work plan. She would support the Amendment. The
topic should remain on the Policy and Services Committee's work plan and
discussed within the Comprehensive Plan Update.

AMENDMENT PASSED: 5-4 Burt, Holman, Klein, Kniss no

Council Member Holman indicated short-term rentals impacted the
availability of housing as well as safety. The Council should address the
issue.

broader issue of commercialization of residential neighborhoods. The other
dimension of commercialization was homes being utilized for full-scale office
businesses. This dimension should be included in the work plan as well.

MAKER AND SECONDER to refer to Policy and Services Committee the
review of how to contend with the increased commercialization of
residences.
