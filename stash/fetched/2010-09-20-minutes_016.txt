Mr. Baum stated under Proposition 218 the cost for the service should be
equivalent to the cost the customer was charged. There was not supposed to
be cross-subsidization.

Mayor Burt clarified the question was whether the Motion complied with
Proposition 218.

Council Member Shepherd stated at the present time the City was out of
compliance with the Proposition 218 regulations.

Mr. Baum stated the Motion brought the City closer to being in compliance
with Proposition 218. There were a number of outstanding issues which was
the reason behind the rate study.

Mayor Burt asked whether the rate study was necessary to know clearly
what would need to be done to be in compliance with Proposition 218. In the
absence of the rate study, was the City in jeopardy of remaining out of
compliance with Proposition 218.

Mr. Baum stated yes, although lessened by the Council actions being taken
by the Motion on the Table.

Mayor Burt clarified the Motion moved the City closer to compliance.

Mr. Baum stated Staffâ€™s recommendation was closer to compliance with
Proposition 218; although, Council and the community had provided a
number of reasons why the recommendation may not be advisable.

Mr. Keene stated a remedy to the issue was the Cost of Service Study which
should be completed during the course of the year. The intent of the Study
would be to specifically inform Staff where the City was in respect to being in
compliance with the Proposition 218 regulations.

Mayor Burt asked whether the timeline was the fall 2010 to receive the
completed Study.

Mr. Keene stated Staff expected to have a draft in November of 2010 to be
reviewed at the City Manager level and be reviewed by the Finance
Committee by January 2011.

Council Member Shepherd asked for an explanation on the Staff report
regarding a 100 percent increase for the cost of the mini-can by the year
2012.
