They're actually really astounding. 1950 Newell, square footage of the
house was 3,508, square footage of the basement was 2,973. This is a huge
basement. This is twice the size of my cute little bungalow. 1405 Harker,
square footage of the house was 3,460, square footage of the basement was
2,104. 713 South Hampton, square footage of the house was 3,550, square
footage of the basement was 2,755. The largest was at 736 Garland which I
just believe was torn down and is just getting started. The square footage
of the house was 3,691, square footage of the basement was 3,545. At
1210 Newell, the project right across the street from the Main Library,
square footage of the house is 3,376, and square footage of the basement is
2,491. Judy did not look up how deep the basements were. If you go to the
one on 1210 Newell, you can see that the basement is still being made.
They have the wooden structures up, and it certainly looks deeper than 10
feet. I have not checked these, but Judy is very accurate. I do believe that
these are probably fairly accurate. Also in the paper this last week was an
article on the dying trees in Palo Alto. I can't help but somehow think that
the amount of water that is being pumped out for these basements in some
way could be contributing to the problem of the dying trees. I suppose that
somebody would have to take a map of all the projects, figure out how much
exactly water has been pumped out, estimated to be 8-10 million gallons per
project, and then pinpoint the dying trees. I certainly think that in times of
drought this is not a good practice. Thank you very much.

Mayor Holman: Question for you. Council Member Burt.

Council Member Burt: Can you confirm are those all two-story homes?

Ms. Vrhel: I don't know how tall they are. I know that the basements are
this size, and the footprint of the house is that size. I don't know if they're
two-story or not.

Council Member Burt: I'm sorry. That figure of the home was the footprint,
not the floor area necessarily?

Ms. Vrhel: What she wrote was the square footage of the house.

Council Member Burt: Square footage is normally total floor area ...

Ms. Vrhel: From the ground up.

Council Member Burt: ... not footprint.

Ms. Vrhel: Does that make sense? From the ground up.
