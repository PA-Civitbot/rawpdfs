Vice Mayor Kleinberg said from her observation, it was safer to slow down
traffic for the safety of pedestrians and bicyclists.   The Channing Avenue
traffic-calming project was setting a precedent for the City. The majority of
the residents did not want funds spent on traffic calming.

Council Member Morton said from the Channing Avenue traffic calming
experience, a lesson could be learned on how to properly approach traffic
calming.

Mayor Burch asked why the contractor had not corrected the difference in
height of the speed tables.

Mr. Emslie said because of the street grading, the contractor picked an
arbitrary point to measure the three inches.

Council Member Freeman asked whether the three inches would allow low
riding vehicles to travel over the speed tables at 25 mph.

Mr. Emslie said the speed table would always be a variation; it would never
be a consistent three inches.

Council Member Freeman asked whether a lower riding vehicle could pass
over the speed table at 25 MPH.

Mr. Emslie said yes.

MOTION PASSED 6-0, Beecham, Mossar, Ojakian absent.

Vice Mayor Kleinberg asked about the Feasibility Study for Channing Avenue
between Greer Road and Wildwood Lane.

Mr. Emslie said it needed to be initiated by the neighbors. Funds had been
set aside for various projects.

Assistant City Manager Emily Harrison said traffic calming of the School
Commute Corridor would take a higher priority over neighborhood traffic
calming.
