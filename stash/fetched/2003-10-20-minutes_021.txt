Council Member Kleinberg asked staff if there were transit design projects
for public parking and resident overnight parking.

Mr. Emslie said the City should always have the option to regulate the
parking in the manner that fits the public benefit.

AMENDMENT WITHDRAWN BY MAKER

Council Member Kishimoto said there was no open space requirement for
RT-35 or RT-50. Open space for playing should be provided for families.

Mr. Emslie said the Council should direct staff to add performance standards
for the type of open space required.

AMENDMENT: Council Member Kishimoto moved, seconded by Lytle, to
direct staff to come back with a second reading of the ordinance to address
performance standards for open space, including standards to support use
by families with children.

Ms. Furth said the language was clear that parking needed to be adequate
for residents of any particular building.

Council Member Lytle said a performance standard should allow open space
to accommodate families with children.

Council Member Kleinberg asked the Interim City Attorney to clarify the law
regarding discrimination of families with children.

Ms. Furth said no one was allowed to discriminate against families with
children by law.

Council Member Kleinberg asked if it was necessary to add words to the
Performance Specifications.

Ms. Furth said it could be useful to the Architectural Review Board (ARB).

Council Member Kleinberg wanted clarification it was not direction to the
developer but how the Council would review it.

Ms. Furth said it gave the ARB additional strengths when reviewing.

Vice Mayor Beecham asked for the main motion.

Council Member Freeman said the map designation of Homer and Channing
Avenues direction were reversed and needed correction.
