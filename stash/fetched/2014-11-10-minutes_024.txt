19.   PUBLIC HEARING: Resolution 9468 entitled “Resolution of the Council
      of the City of Palo Alto Adopting the 2015-2023 Housing Element of
      the Comprehensive Plan and Associated Mitigated Negative Declaration
      and Mitigation Monitoring Program.”

Mayor Shepherd reported every city in California was required to have a
General Plan which the City entitled the Comprehensive Plan. The Housing
Element must be updated and approved. The Housing Element required the
adoption of zoning for the City's fair share of the Regional Housing Needs
Allocation (RHNA) assigned to Palo Alto by the Association of Bay Area
Governments (ABAG).

Hillary Gitelman, Director of Planning and Community Environment, hoped
the Council would hold the Public Hearing and adopt a Resolution to adopt
the Housing Element Update.

Tim Wong, Senior Planner, reported the Housing Element was one of seven
mandated elements of a General Plan, and the only element requiring State
certification. The deadline for updating the Housing Element was the end of
January 2015. The Housing Element should be updated every eight years.
The current eight-year cycle was 2015-2023.
