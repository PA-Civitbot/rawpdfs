existing ordinance.

Vice Mayor Kleinberg said if the priority was to increase affordable housing
and to increase home ownership, the market should not determine whether
two dwellings on the same property were rental units or home ownership.

Mr. Larkin said there was a distinction between second units added to an
existing structure and a common interest development, which was a
separate type of ownership interest.
Mr. Larkin explained there was a requirement for compliance with the Sub-
division Map Act and there had to be legal parcels created which was
different than what was proposed.

Vice Mayor Kleinberg said it would preclude what would happen under the
ordinance without an application for division of the parcel.

Mr. Lusardi confirmed.   It would not preclude a tenancy in common or a
common ownership.

Vice Mayor Kleinberg stated the ordinance would not allow separate
ownership of units as it currently stood. She asked about the process when
an owner decided to sell a unit.

Ms. Grote said a rental unit could not be converted to a condominium unit
unless there was a consecutive three-year/3 percent or greater vacancy
rate.

Vice Mayor Kleinberg requested a friendly amendment to change the
wording in the ordinance from “churches and religious institutions” to
“religious congregations and institutions”. Also, the green building design
encouraged shaded attachments to homes.

Mr. Lusardi said the Council could add the additional sustainability element.

Vice Mayor Kleinberg asked about the percentage.

Mr. Emslie said the Council could give staff the direction to return with the
correct percentages for the two zones.

Vice Mayor Kleinberg asked about the allowance of detached storage
structures in front yards and suggested a friendly amendment that storage
sheds not be allowed to extend into front yards.

Council Member Beecham suggested staff return to the Council with items
