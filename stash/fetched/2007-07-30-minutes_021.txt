INCORPORATED INTO SUBSTITUTE MOTION WITH CONSENT OF
MAKER AND SECONDER to not delete the flood plain (F) district and to
encourage staff and City officials to be mindful of Global Climate Change.

Council Member Mossar stated there is a serious issue with runoff and a lot
of pervious surface is not much better than impervious surface. It is much
cleaner to support staff and P&TC recommendations and, if the Working
Group comes up with better ways, then changes could be made.

Council Member Barton said he agreed and he would combine his comments
with Vice Mayor Klein’s and Council Member Drekmeier’s.

Council Member Cordell stated the fair way to do this is to get input from the
public and then make the rules and let the public have a say. She would not
support the Substitute Motion.

Council Member Kleinberg agreed with Council Member Cordell because it
sets a bad precedent to adopt laws and ordinances that affect property
rights or any other rights which are inherently defective. The people who
have stood up and spoken about their property and the way it would impact
their property show that this is not good legislation.

Council Member Beecham asked Mr. Baum for help on the protocol. He
would like to separate the issue of the OS. He asked if that would be a
motion or a request.

Mr. Baum said it could be handled either way. Council Member Beecham
could request that the Mayor divide the motion. Should the Mayor decline to
divide, then he could make it as a motion and the group can decide.

Mayor Kishimoto divided the motion for the purpose of voting.
