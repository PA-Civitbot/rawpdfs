Mayor Holman: Could you clarify the language for the Clerk please? Council
Member DuBois.

Council Member DuBois: Funding for Caltrain on the order of 15 percent of
the bond measure.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to replace in Motion Part A, “$750 million” with
“15 percent.”

Council Member DuBois: Again I think you just totally separate it from the
other Caltrain requests. They shouldn't even be tied together. Just a
separate category of grade separations.

Mayor Holman: A question for the maker and seconder of the motion. I
know it is, but to be clear, does this need to be clarified that it's in addition
to the already considered Caltrain allocation?

Council Member Scharff:     Sure, let's put it in there.   Why not?      Then it's
clear.

Mayor Holman: David, this is "in addition to ...

Council Member Burt: It's "separate from."

Council Member Scharff: "Separate" as opposed to "addition." I agree with
you.

Mayor Holman: "Separate from" is better.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to add to the end of Motion Part A, “separate from
other Caltrain enhancements.”

Mayor Holman: Council Member DuBois, did you have other comments you
wanted to make to your second?

Council Member DuBois: I wanted to ask the maker. It's been brought up a
couple of times about the process the money will be allocated under the
bond. Do we want to speak to that at all in terms of ...

Council Member Scharff: I'm sorry. Say that again.

Council Member Berman: The process.
