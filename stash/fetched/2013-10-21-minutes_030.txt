13.   Approval of Contract for the Downtown Development CAP to Dyett &
      Bhatia Urban & Regional Planners in the Amount Not to Exceed
      $200,000 (Continued from October 7, 2013).

Neilson Buchanan felt the vision, scope and funding for the first phase was
light. The parking in Downtown North was saturated between 9:00 A.M. and
4:00 P.M.     He was concerned about the unintended consequences of
disenfranchising several hundred workers through permit parking.

James Keene, City Manager, noted a misstatement in the Resource Impact
on page 5. The anticipated cost was $250,000. Phase 2 involved decision
making and was the more complicated piece of the study. For the most
part, Phase 1 would occur in 2014. The second phase would not cost
$50,000. It could cost considerably more.

Aaron Aknin, Acting Director of Planning and Community Environment,
reported the Downtown Development CAP was presented to the Council
because of a study completed approximately 30 years ago. A Development
CAP was implemented as a result of the study and included a number of
other provisions. The Downtown Development CAP was associated with the
Downtown Commercial (CD) District and limited growth to 10 percent of 3.5
million square feet of commercial space. The Comprehensive Plan, the
Zoning Code and the 1986 study indicated an analysis should be performed
to determine impacts. In accordance with Council direction, Staff presented
the Request for Proposal (RFP) scope of work to the Planning and
Transportation Commission (PTC), who modified the scope of work. Staff
presented an informational report to the Council in March 2014 and
proceeded with the process in the May-June timeframe. The Phase 1
analysis would encompass review of historic documents, analysis of existing
conditions, and an analysis of projected conditions. In terms of impacts, the
study had to include potential developments in the 27 University Avenue
Arts and Innovation District, the South of Forest Area (SOFA) and in Menlo
Park. Staff recommended the contract be awarded to Dyett & Bhatia, a well-
known planning firm.
