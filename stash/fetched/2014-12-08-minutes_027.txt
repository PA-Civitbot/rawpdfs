Council Member Burt advised that Staff could proceed with planning the
work sessions; however, they would have time to incorporate changes as
directed by the Council in January.

AMENDMENT: Council Member Burt moved, seconded by Council Member
Holman to include in Number 2 of the Motion to direct Staff to provide
Council input on the draft summit and work sessions in January.

Ms. Gitelman would accept Council direction. At some point work on other
initiatives would be delayed.

Council Member Holman interpreted the Amendment as seeking clarity from
Staff regarding the structure of work sessions.

Mr. Keene understood the intent of the Amendment as well as Staff's
position. Staff would proceed with preparing for a summit with the caveat
that the Council could make changes in January. Making changes could
impact the timeframe for other initiatives to be presented to the Council.

Council Member Holman did not view the Amendment as putting off work.
In January, Staff would advise the Council of the plan for moving forward.

Council Member Klein opposed the Amendment, because it proposed
micromanaging Staff.

Council Member Berman stated that realistically the Council could change all
of Staff's preparations. He supported the Amendment as well as Staff
should they report that other initiatives would be delayed because of Council
changes imposed in January.

Council Member Price did not support the Amendment.

MOTION TO CALL THE QUESTION:              Council Member Price called the
