Council Member Kleinberg asked Interim City Attorney Wynne Furth with
regard to Item No. 8 to explain why the contract numbers were gross
numbers and how the cost would be tracked with the law firms.

Interim City Attorney Wynne Furth said the contracts were already budgeted
with various law firms, and contracts entered into with base amounts did not
require City Council approval.

Council Member Morton stated he would not participate in Item No. 6 due to
a conflict of interest because his firm was an accountant for the Museum,
and Item No. 11 because his family owned stock in both PB and Sempra
Energy.

Ms. Furth stated she could not participate in Item No. 11 because her family
owned stock in BP Energy.

Council Member Freeman moved, seconded by Kishimoto, to remove Item
No. 8A.

Mayor Mossar said Item No. 8A would become Item No. 15A.

Council Member Freeman registered “no” votes for Item Nos. 3, 4 and 8.

MOTION: Council Member Burch moved, seconded by Ojakian, to approve
Consent Calendar Items 1-8, 9-12.
