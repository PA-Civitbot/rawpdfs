Jose Gonzalez, 340 Larkspur Drive, East Palo Alto, said the ban on leaf
blowers should be extended to provide time for education.

Valentine Gonzales, 43 Atherwood Avenue, Redwood City, said banning leaf
blowers would affect gardeners and their customers.

Myra Orta, 1225 Via Huerta, Los Altos, said the ban on leaf blowers worked
in Los Altos and many other communities in California without increased
fees.

Miguel Barron, 490 4th Avenue, Redwood City, said he used the quietest leaf
blower with the least amount of pollution.

Ramon Quezada, 258 Alameda, Redwood City, said a solution that benefited
everyone should be found.

Hector Sandoval, c/o 193 Arch, Redwood City, said garden maintenance took
less time with gas leaf blowers than with electric leaf blowers.

Rafael G. Madriz, 342 Beverly Avenue, Millbrae, said he hoped for a solution
to the issue.

Roland Finston, 856 Thornwood Drive, said electric leaf blowers were easier
to turn off when pedestrians and bicyclists were passing by on sidewalks and
streets.

Hillary Hug, 381 Oxford Avenue, said gas leaf blowers created air pollution
and noise.

Jeff Hook, 381 Oxford Avenue, said the current ordinance only banned gas-
powered leaf blowers in residential areas.

Robin Bayer, 381 Oxford Avenue, said a survey by the Comprehensive Plan
Advisory Committee indicated Palo Alto residents valued quiet
neighborhoods and clean air in their community.

David Schrom, 381 Oxford Avenue, said it was difficult to predict the
consequences, which could result from the ban.

Francisco DeLeon, 6 St. Maryâ€™s Road, Redwood City, said he hoped for a
compromise with the City; more time was needed before the ban was
enforced.

Nonette Hanko, 3172 Emerson Street, said her gardener tested his gas and
electric leaf blower versus raking; the gas blower worked the best.
