Vice Mayor Kleinberg concurred with the previous comments made by
Council Member Mossar.

Council Member Kishimoto clarified prior to the budget when staff brought
the matter back to the Council, they would not have the City Manager’s
response to review.

Council Member Mossar said the City Manager’s response would be a part of
the discussion, but her intention was not to accept those responses but
include them as part of the discussion.

Council Member Freeman expressed support for the motion. She inquired if
the audit report returned to the Council prior to the next budget, how should
comments be made.

Council Member Mossar said nothing prevented the Council from making
comments in writing. She believed it was a referral to a future discussion.

Council Member Freeman said her concern was the Council would get the
report without any comments from the Council. She did recall the P&S
Committee agreed go forward with the recommendation.

MOTION PASSED 9-0.

PALO ALTO REDEVELOPMENT AGENCY AT 9:08 P.M. AND
