Council Member Burt asked if the project life was 20 years with a 20-year
return on the capital investment because of the bond term.

Mr. Binder replied that the technology for food and yard material was new to
the United States. Because of this they had to use a typical financing period
for projects of this sort which was 20 years versus 30.

Council Member Burt noted that was for funding purposes, not for useful life.

Mr. Binder replied that if it wasn’t funded it wouldn’t be built, so they had to
use the more conservative assumptions.

Council Member Burt stated that he was interested to know the range of
useful life the City may experience.

Mr. Binder stated the companies that responded to the Request for
Information foresaw a 20-year design life, including repair and replacement
of equipment.

Mr. Bobel noted that the engineering life of this type of project was new to
the United States and required a conservative assumption because of
uncertainties.

Council Member Burt confirmed that 20 years was a moderately conservative
expectation of a useful life.

Mr. Bobel stated the concrete was going to last longer but the piping and
other equipment was less predictable. He noted that the progressiveness of
the field may cause the equipment to be changed out prior to 20 years.

Council Member Burt asked when the Wastewater Treatment Plant was built
and what repairs had been done on it.

Mr. Bobel stated that after 30 years the incinerator was replaced. He noted
that when it was built, it was standard technology.

Council Member Burt asked if the experience with wet anaerobic digestion
was better than with dry.

Mr. Bobel replied yes.

Council Member Burt asked if the wet was anticipated to have the same
useful equipment life.

Mr. Bobel said that was the assumption used in the study.
