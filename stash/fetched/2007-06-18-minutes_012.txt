Council Member Kleinberg stated there was an unacceptable amount of
vagueness to this Ordinance.

Council Member Cordell stated there were revisions that would need to be
made before approving the Ordinance.

Vice Mayor Klein stated the revisions were approved by the Council at the
first reading and incorporated in this Ordinance.

Council Member Beecham asked Vice Mayor Klein to restate his motion.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION: Vice Mayor Klein moved, seconded by Kleinberg,
to adopt the Ordinance with the following revisions: Delete from page 3,
section 4.a(3): general business services, professional and general business
offices, and private educational facilities, and that day care be allowed in one
of the three commercial buildings (or the equivalent square footage). Also,
on page 5, section 12, that the residential FAR of .54 be recalculated to give
effect to removal of one of the detached homes as it appeared in prior
drafts.

Council Member Kleinberg asked whether the guest parking could be
established during the review process.

Mr. Emslie replied it was part of the Site and Design Review and would come
back to the Council.

Council Member Kleinberg noted the Ordinance referred to Attachment A the
“project” which was not attached.

Mr. Emslie stated it was the site plan that the Council reviewed at the first
reading of the Ordinance, which would generally not be attached at the
second reading.

Council Member Kleinberg asked whether the BMR units could be mixed
throughout the project or whether they were required to be in one place.

Mr. Emslie stated the parameters of the Ordinance establish the location of
the mixed use building, which included the 14 BMR units.

Council Member Kleinberg asked for clarification whether the units were all
in one place.

Mr. Emslie stated she was correct.
