crime. He also discussed the City's discrimination against the Palo Alto Free
Press as a news media organization, when no other city had taken that
position. He stated it was shameful conduct.

Fred Balin discussed Business Association of California Avenue (BACA) and
the California Avenue Area Development Association (CAADA). He indicated
a key discussion should be the connection between the new BACA and
CAADA.      He felt the Community, especially the California Avenue business
community, needed to clearly understand what happened within CAADA
from 2005 to 2009, during the early days of the streetscape process. He
said he was writing an article that among other things called for the business
leaders of BACA to address how they would ensure they would not become
the CAADA of 2009.
