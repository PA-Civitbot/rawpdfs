Council Member Kleinberg said the property should be left in the RT-50
zone because there were plenty of ways to preserve the property.
Council Member Freeman’s suggestion that the bike route be more
charming was intriguing.

Council Member Ojakian said he had difficulty approving the CAP if the
transformer station was not in RT-50. The site was ideal for an Alma
Place type construction.

Council Member Lytle said she was willing to compromise her
sentiments and vote for the motion in order to abide by the sentiments
of other colleagues.

AMENDMENT PASSED 4-3, Burch, Kleinberg, Ojakian “no,” Morton,
Mossar “not participating.”

Council Member Freeman said the adoption of the motion should be
predicated on the legal opinion on legal ramifications for modifying a
PF zoned area.

Vice Mayor Beecham said Council Member Freeman’s suggestion was
unnecessary because the parcel was included with the RT-50. The City
could not do anything illegal.

AMENDMENT: Council Member Freeman moved that legal staff
explain the legal process for transferring public facilities into other
zoning.

Vice Mayor Beecham responded that Council Member Freeman’s
question was answered earlier in the meeting.

Ms. Furth said staff would come back to the Council with additional
information. The extra legal steps required had to do with a later
decision the City would make to transfer the property to a third party
to develop it as housing.

Council Member Freeman clarified the Council could legally change a
public facility to another zone by a Council vote.

Ms. Furth said that was correct.

Council Member Lytle said it would be helpful for the Attorney’s Office
to explain the disposition prior to taking final action.
