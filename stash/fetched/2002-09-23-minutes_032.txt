point was to set up an array of choices for the community
to have input into the process.

Council Member Burch questioned “neighborhood sensitive.”
People had different opinions, and some people would not
like the final product.

Council Member Kleinberg recalled a general concept drawing
that was presented to the Council by the architects. The
Council was told at the time that the drawing was not a
proposed Library and Community Center.

Ms. Merkes said elevations and drawings needed to be done
sooner solely for the Proposition 14 application.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE MAKER
AND   SECONDER   to   remove    the  word   “most”  before
“neighborhood-sensitive” design.

Mayor Ojakian said he considered not voting for the motion
because the wording was vague. The architects needed to be
given latitude for siting of the building.

Council Member Morton clarified the architects could have
any design option that met the modified scheme, which was
to leave the tennis courts in place.

Mayor Ojakian said yes.

Council Member Morton could not support the motion on that
basis.
MOTION PASSED 7-2, Burch, Morton “no.”

MOTION: Council Member Kishimoto moved, seconded by Lytle,
to direct staff to agendize consideration of a discussion
of a park dedication ordinance for the Mitchell Park
Library.

Ms. Harrison said there was no money to do any additional
design between the current time and the election in
November 2002.

Mr. Benest said the next stage     of   design   would   happen
subsequent to the bond measure.
