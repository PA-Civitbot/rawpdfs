                              MINUTES
Mayor Holman asked if the continuation date for the discussion was March
23, 2015.

Beth Minor, Acting City Clerk, indicated possible dates were March 23 or
March 30.

Mayor Holman requested objections to carrying the Motion forward to March
23.

Council Member Burt preferred the Motion be withdrawn and the Council
begin a discussion of alternatives on March 23.

Council Member Wolbach believed the Motion was clear and targeted the
core concerns around development. It seemed to support and encourage
further work on TDM and tying that to development. The Motion did not
preclude the Council from holding additional discussions. The Council should
support the Motion unless Staff indicated it was superfluous or would create
excessive work for Staff.

Mayor Holman     clarified   that   the   Motion   needed   clarification   or   an
amendment.

Council Member Scharff suggested a Motion to Continue was needed.

Mayor Holman concurred.

MOTION TO CONTINUE: Council Member Scharff moved, seconded by
Council Member Berman to continue this Agenda Item and Motion until
March 23, 2015.

Council Member Scharff stated the hour was late and Council was not at its
best. The Motion should remain on the table for amendments or a vote.

Council Member Wolbach inquired whether Staff could provide some
feedback regarding the amount of work required for the Motion prior to
March 23.

Mr. Keene advised that a direction for Staff to perform work was out of order
with a Motion to Continue on the floor.

Council Member Burt believed supporters of the Motion would want to
continue it to the next meeting.

MOTION TO CONTINUE FAILED:                4-5, Berman, Kniss, Scharff, Wolbach
yes
