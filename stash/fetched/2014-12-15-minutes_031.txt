INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to set a minimum of not less than $200 per
square foot for the TDRs.

Council Member Burt asked if Council Member Scharff was confident the City
could obtain $200 per square foot.

Council Member Scharff replied yes.

Council Member Schmid calculated the current market value per square foot
as approximately $8 million for 10,000 square feet; therefore, $200 per
square foot seemed reasonable.

Council Member Klein felt the Council was doing exactly what it criticized
developers for doing: attempting to maximize its real estate interests. The
Council did not have to sell TDRs to fund repairs to the Roth Building. The
Motion set a dangerous precedent and was inconsistent with the Council's
ideas of limiting development.

Council Member Price would support the Amended Motion even though there
was a great deal of uncertainty.

Council Member Holman reiterated that the TDRs would return to the City if
the sale price did not meet the minimum of $200 per square foot.

MOTION AS AMENDED PASSED: 6-1-2 Klein no, Berman, Shepherd not
participating

Vice Mayor Kniss indicated the next item for consideration was a one-time
contribution of $1 million toward the cost of rehabilitation and seismic
retrofitting of the building. She inquired whether rehabilitation and seismic
retrofitting was needed whether or not the History Museum project came to
pass.

Mr. Ghaemmaghami responded yes.

Vice Mayor Kniss recalled Mr. Green's statement that the cost estimate for
repairs was closer to $700,000 and contingencies increased the estimate to
$1 million.

Mr. Green clarified that the $1 million estimate applied to repairs for the
back wall of the building. It did not apply to rehabilitation and seismic
upgrades of the entire building.

Vice Mayor Kniss assumed the back wall would have to be repaired.
