success of the new trial plan was measured.

Vice Mayor Burch asked, assuming the motion was passed, would the barrier
next to Stanford Electric be removed as soon as possible.

Mr. Emslie said yes and understood it was part of the motion.

MOTION PASSED 6-2, Kishimoto, Mossar no, Beecham “not participating.”

Ms. Ancel added there was a resolution before Council to approve the
Modified Mixed Plan and to adopt the Mitigate Negative Declaration. Staff
needed to make revisions to reflect the plan that was adopted and rename it
as the “Revised No Closure Plan.” Because of the CEQA findings, a motion
was required to adopt the Mitigated Negative Declaration in the findings of
the Resolution.

MOTION: Council Member Morton moved, seconded by Cordell to adopt a
Resolution to approve a Mitigated Negative Declaration for the Modified No
Closure Plan.

    Resolution 8415 entitled “Resolution of the Council of the City of Palo
    Alto Adopting a Mitigated Negative Declaration Pursuant to the California
    Environmental Quality Act for and Approving the Permanent
    Implementation of the Modified Mixed Measures Traffic Calming Plan for
    the Downtown North Neighborhood.”

Council Member Kleinberg asked why a Mitigated Negative Declaration was
being adopted when this was a trial.

Ms. Ancel said because CEQA came into the approved plan.

Outside Counsel Roger Beers added it was an action that had some impact.

Council Member Kleinberg said an action was not taken when the trial was
adopted nine months prior.

Mr. Beers advised to base the decision on the Negative Declaration because
one had been prepared and the process had gone through. He felt since
Council was going to take action that had conceivable impact, it would be
better to have a CEQA document as support.

MOTION PASSED 6-1, Kishimoto no, Beecham “not participating”, Mossar
absent.
