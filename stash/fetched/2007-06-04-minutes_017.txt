Brad Eikian, 172 University Avenue, stated the issue of safety was not the
issue at hand.

Jim Baer, 172 University Avenue, stated throughout the City of Palo Alto
there were many non-conforming medical uses. If the determination is
based on a complaint, then the door will be open to land use by complaint
and not land use by policy and safety.

Bill Garrett, Esq., 525 University Avenue, said the Council needed to be
consistent and fair in land use decisions and he did not support the zone
change.

David Baumgarten, 915 Waverley Street, stated the vision of the SOFA plan
was for a walkable and livable neighborhood that was compatible with the
surrounding residential neighborhood. He supported the zone change.

Council Member Drekmeier questioned why the compromise was not
implemented.

Mr. Baumgarten replied he accepted a compromise that involved moving the
transformer, and putting up a fence to shield the electrical panel, which was
three feet from his property line. He added months went by with no
implementation.

Council Member Beecham stated he had been working with David
Baumgarten over the past year on some of the issues and concerns, which
were the pad-mounted transformer, noise from the air conditioning, and
potential radiation from the x-ray unit. He stated he was reluctant to rezone
it considering its history. Staff had informed him that up 20 parcels could be
affected, which would become a policy issue. He asked how many parcels
would be involved with this zone change.

Director of Planning Steve Emslie advised that seven properties were
affected.

Council Member Beecham asked how many were part of the considerations
in SOFA 1 or SOFA 2.

Mr. Emslie replied they were all in SOFA 1 but there were considerably more
in SOFA 2.

Council Member Beecham stated he was reluctant to reopen SOFA 1 and he
did not support the motion.
