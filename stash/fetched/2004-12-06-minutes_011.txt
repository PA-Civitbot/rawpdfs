Council Member Kishimoto asked about the overall process and the
sequencing of the building design and the zoning change.

Mr. Emslie said if the Council initiated the zone change amendment, it would
go to the Planning and Transportation Commission (P&TC). The P&TC would
hold one or multiple public hearings and return with a recommendation to
the City Council.

Council Member Kishimoto asked         when    the   plan   would   go   to   the
Architectural Review Board (ARB).

Mr. Emslie said the ARB would serve in an advisory role.

Council Member Kishimoto asked whether there were two actions; a building
design and a zoning change.

Mr. Emslie confirmed.

Council Member Kishimoto said the ARB might be advisory for the zoning
change.

Mr. Emslie said the design had been to the ARB for the conceptual design.

Council Member Kishimoto said the Council was being asked to authorize
$275,000 to proceed to 30 percent design. She questioned when the zoning
change was initiated whether a signal was being sent to staff and the P&TC
that the Council was authorizing the concept of building up to a 60-foot
height.

Mr. Emslie said the Council would not be bound by the terms of the ultimate
recommendations. The Council would be asking the P&TC and the ARB to
study the issue and return to the Council with recommendations.

Council Member Kishimoto said the next step for Council would be a report
back from the Police Department and Planning Division on the zoning
change.

Mr. Roberts said staff would finalize with the consultant the additional fee to
design to the 30 percent level. Staff would return to Council with that
contract amendment for the additional work.

Vice Mayor Burch asked about eliminating Forest Avenue between the Civic
