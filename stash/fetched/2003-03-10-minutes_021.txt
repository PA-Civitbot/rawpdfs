AMENDMENT PASSED 8-0, Mossar absent.

Council Member Kishimoto asked whether there were any legal issues the
Council should be aware of about libel and slander.

Mr. Calonne understood Mr. Alexander to say it was important that the
Council spoke politely to one another. Senior staff did not enjoy any type of
First Amendment protection while in the Council employ.

Council Member Kishimoto questioned whether the words, “do not libel or
slander” should be added.

Mr. Calonne did not agree. The rules were for the Council, and the
perspective was what would make the Council function better.

MOTION: Council Member Kishimoto moved, seconded by Kleinberg, to
refer to the Policy and Services Committee to clarify the procedure for
compliance and enforcement of these Protocols.

MOTION PASSED 8-0, Mossar absent.

MOTION: Council Member Morton moved, seconded by Burch, to limit
debate to 11:25 p.m. and at that time to call for the question.

MOTION FAILED 2-6, Burch, Morton “yes, ” Mossar absent.

Council Member Lytle felt it was important that the codes contained the
input of everyone affected.
Vice Mayor Beecham felt the sense of the Council was to not close the
debate on the Protocols.

Council Member Freeman recommended trying to get through as much of
the Protocol discussion as possible at the current meeting.

Ms. Harrison said the Council would not be able to continue the discussion of
Protocols until mid-May, due to scheduled Council Appointed Officers (CAO)
evaluations.

Vice Mayor Beecham suggested staff consider an alternate day, other than a
Monday, to find a date to continue the discussion.

Ms. Harrison said staff would review agendas to try to find another hour for
Council discussion.
