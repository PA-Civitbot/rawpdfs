STUDY SESSION

1.   Municipal Services Center Site for Relocation of Palo Alto’s Auto
     Dealers

Staff provided a review of the current issues related to the Palo Alto Auto
Dealership. Two dealerships have either moved or gone out of business,
leaving five remaining dealerships, generating $1.9 million annually. Since
2000, the City had lost $1.0 million in auto dealership revenues.

A Council Colleague’s Memo dated April 7, 2005, gave staff direction to
complete a preliminary analysis of converting the Municipal Services Center
(MSC) site to create an “auto row”.

Staff provided Council with an overview of the current MSC configuration
including details of the operations at the City yard and the efficiencies
related to one City yard. In addition, staff presented options for developing
an auto row at the site.

The City Council asked staff questions related to the proposed options and
the financial analyses. At the conclusion of the questions and discussion,
Council determined creating an auto row at the MSC was not financially
feasible and directed staff to continue working with the existing auto dealers
on strategies for retaining their dealerships in Palo Alto.

No action required.
