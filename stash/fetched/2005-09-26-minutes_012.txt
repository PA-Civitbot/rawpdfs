changes to the existing carport codes. She based her request on Palo Alto’s
history, public opinion, and common sense.

Michael Griffin, 344 Poe Street, asked the Council not to adopt the carport
exemption.

Robert Moss, 4010 Orme Street, said in 1978 carports were included in
FAR’s. Carports or garages were a requirement in the zoning ordinance. He
was not in favor of eliminating the carport exemption.

Chris Draper, Government Coordinator for the Silicon Valley Association of
Realtors, said carports were not living space. The option was beneficial to
homeowners and potential homeowners and encouraged the Council to
consider the recommendation.

Mayor Burch declared the Public Hearing closed at 9:20 p.m.

Council Member Morton asked whether there were major problems that
merit a change when carports were considered part of the FAR.

Mr. Emslie said no there was not.

Council Member Morton asked if it would be easier to raise the homeowner’s
exemption to 200 square feet for smaller homes and not produce a rash
number of carports.

Mr. Emslie said the Council had adopted changes to streamline the
Ordinance for Home Improvement Exemptions (HIE) that included an
exemption for 100 square feet. It was a more direct way to deal with post
construction retrofits that lead into code enforcement problems.

MOTION: Council Member Morton moved, seconded by Kishimoto, to
approve the staff’s recommendation to the Planning and Transportation
Commission (P&TC) to amend the Low Density Residential chapter,
eliminating the floor area exclusion for carports that are completely open on
three or more sides.
