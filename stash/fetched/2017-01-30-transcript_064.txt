Council Member Fine: It's acceptable.

Mayor Scharff: Let's see where we are on this. Council Member Fine,
Council Member DuBois, have you both spoken to your Motion?

Council Member DuBois: Yeah.

Mayor Scharff: That's means we're now at Council Member Kou.

Council Member Kou: Council Member DuBois had said what I wanted to
express, which is to use Stanford's language. Thank you.

Mayor Scharff: Council Member Holman.

Council Member Holman: I would like to see "C" eliminated or actually
refined such that housing at Town and Country Village would be limited to
second-floor office replacement.

Vice Mayor Kniss: If you make it an Amendment, I'll second it.

Council Member Holman: First, we'll see if the …

Mayor Scharff: First of all, would you accept it or not?

Council Member Holman: I'm sorry?

Mayor Scharff: Council Member …

Council Member Fine: I would accept that.

Mayor Scharff: Maybe we could get the language.

Council Member Holman: Housing potential in Town and Country Village
would be limited to second-floor office conversion.

Council Member Fine: Let me ask you a quick question about that. Would it
only be limited to second-floor housing or would there be the potential of

Council Member Holman: There are many Comprehensive Plan policies and
programs that talk about recognizing and preserving Town and Country
Village and attractive retail service, talks about preserving the scale of it and
everything.

Council Member Fine: Exactly. I think the point is you don't want ground-
floor housing at Town and Country. Is that correct?
