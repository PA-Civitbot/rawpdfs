SUBSTITUTE MOTION: Council Member Cordell moved, seconded by
Klein, to not take action on the policy at this time but to refer it back to the
Policy and Services Committee for discussion and to return to the Council
with final recommendations.

Assistant City Manager Emily Harrison requested all comments and/or
requested changes be sent to Assistant to the City Manager Kelly Morariu.

Vice Mayor Klein noted the information placed before them was a framework
and not guidelines.     He referred to the Junior Museum and Zoo and
questioned whether the Council should continue to hold them in the
abeyance or was there consensus for staff to move forward in determining if
a relationship would be possible.

Ms. Harrison stated the budget planning for 2007-08 had begun and,
therefore, any changes regarding City management of the Jr. Museum and
Zoo would be difficult to incorporate in the normal budget process.

Mayor Kishimoto asked whether there were any other changes.

City Manager Frank Benest stated staff would like to move forward in
discussions with the Friends of the Junior Museum and Zoo.

Council Member Cordell stated the Junior Museum and Zoo would move
forward when the Policy was finalized.

City Attorney Gary Baum stated the discussion should be agendized for a
later date.

Mayor Kishimoto commented the set of policies governing Public/Private
Partnerships was critical. She asked how volunteer groups might be covered
under this Policy.

Ms. Harrison stated the City had volunteer waiver forms and insurance.

Council Member Beecham stated it would be a general policy and not
focused on one organization.

Council Member Morton cautioned the volunteer community would stop
participating if the policy were too stringent.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION PASSED 8-1 Drekmeier no.
