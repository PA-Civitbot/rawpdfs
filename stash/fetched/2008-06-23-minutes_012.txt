Council Member Espinosa requested more          information   regarding   the
recycling bank and residential recycling.

Mr. Roberts stated the community had already proven to be engaged and
active in recycling.

Council Member Espinosa asked the consequence of Council choosing a non-
staff recommended option as in the baseline with the second option.

Mr. Roberts stated Council gave policy direction in pursuing alternatives or
not and dependent upon what Council decided, staff would pursue that
option.

Council Member Espinosa stressed again the need for further information on
the pros and cons and cost of the recommendation.

Council Member Yeh asked for more details on RFP scenario two, such as
enhancing mandatory recycling and what enforcements that would entail.
He also asked whether item 4 referred to residential recycling and item 6
referred to commercial recycling.

Mr. Roberts asked for clarification.

Council Member Yeh asked how recycling would be enhanced though
mandatory participation.

Mr. Roberts stated the mandatory participation was a phased-in program
beginning with education and outreach during the first year. The second year
would deal with notifications and if necessary a third year of which an
Ordinance would be put into place for a mandatory system (yet to be
developed).

Mr. Reiser added scenario two came from the Zero Waste operational plan,
with programs looking at waste composition studies. He stated the purpose
of mandating the recycling program was due to recyclables still being found
in the waste stream.

Council Member Yeh asked whether customers had the option to opt out of a
service level. He asked whether this practice was common in other
jurisdictions.
