Vice Mayor Kishimoto asked whether staff was requesting input on the
Zoning Ordinance Update (ZOU) schedule or was the focus more on the
Comp Plan schedule.

Mr. Emslie said the focus was more on the Comp Plan. The ZOU was
provided to show how a more focused program would enable staff in
meeting the timeline.

Vice Mayor Kishimoto asked to include a provision in the work plan to
identify areas in neighborhoods that needed additional parks and community
facilities.

Council Member Morton asked which areas needed to be identified.

Vice Mayor Kishimoto said there were no specific areas but she envisioned
looking at the overall land use map to determine what neighborhoods were
deficient in a park or a particular facility.

Council Member Morton accepted the addition.

MAKER AND SECONDER to identify areas in neighborhoods that need
additional parks and community facilities.

Vice Mayor Kishimoto asked to add to the work plan “to strengthen and
support the pattern of walkable neighborhoods and employment centers by
reviewing the land use map and policies to integrate transportation and land
use.”

Council Member Morton asked staff how much more work would be required
to add to the work plan to identify, integrate, or enhance walkable
neighborhoods.

Mr. Emslie said it would be minimal since the Comp Plan already addressed
that goal.

Council Member Morton agreed to add to strengthen and support the pattern
of walkable neighborhoods.

Joy Ogawa said if the Comp Plan was to be extended through 2020, she
hoped issues between now and then would be explored more
