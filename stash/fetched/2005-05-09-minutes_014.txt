CLOSED SESSION

Mayor Burch asked the City Attorney to clarify the basis for Closed
Sessions and the types of issues discussed in the sessions.

City Attorney Gary Baum said the three primary reasons for Closed
Sessions were to discuss: 1) personnel matters to hear complaints or
charges against an employee or to instruct the bargaining representative
on labor negotiations; 2) litigations that are potential or existing to
provide direction to the attorneys on how litigation should be handled
and to be informed of the nature or type of litigation so that the City
could address problems enclosed within the litigation; 3) real estate
negotiations to inform the negotiator of price and terms of property
being acquired, leased, or sold and how it should be handled by the City
