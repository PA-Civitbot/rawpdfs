Ms. Shen stated she would work with the recruiter and that she already has
a job description ready. City Clerk, Donna Grider has provided feedback.
The recruiters have already stated that the candidate pool is small for this
position, and we should look at someone with more technology capability
that could guide us going forward.

Vice Mayor Kniss suggested that the Committee and Ms. Shen move quickly
with this recruitment. If the recruiters returned their information within a
week from now, the Committee could meet next week.

Chair Scharff confirmed Thursday, October 30 at 5:00 P.M. as the next
meeting.

The Committee went into the Closed Session at 3:45 P.M.
