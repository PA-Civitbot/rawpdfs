REPORTS OF COMMITTEES AND COMMISSIONS

10.   Recommendation of Library          Advisory    Commission     Regarding
      Downtown Library Hours

City Manager Frank Benest said it was not the appropriate time to consider
the Downtown Library hours.

Ellen Wyman, 546 Washington Avenue, said the Downtown Library needed
to be opened on Saturdays.

Betsy Allyn, Willmar Drive, said it was necessary to keep the libraries open.

Jeff Levinsky, 1682 Hamilton Avenue, said reopening the Downtown Library
on Saturdays would be an efficient use of taxpayer funds.

Herb Borock, P.O. Box 632, said the Council should set the policy regarding
the Downtown Library hours and staff should implement it.

Robert Moss, 4010 Orme Street, said the Downtown Library never should
have been closed on Saturdays, and it also needed to be open on Sundays.

Robert Pritchett said access to the library computers provided the low
income and homeless the opportunity to apply for jobs, and he asked that
the libraries remain open.
