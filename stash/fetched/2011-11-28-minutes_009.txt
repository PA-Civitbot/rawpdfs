Mr. Perez said the actuary requested to see trending data. The current data
was available in the report.

Council Member Klein could not see how the level of retirement trend could
continue.

Mr. Perez clarified the changes made in 2004 to the retirement packages
caused an implosion of retirement costs from those who were hired prior and
could retire earlier.

Council Member Klein said because of the economic trends in the country the
national reports indicate a later in life retirement rather than the information
presented in the report.

Council Member Shepherd asked with the current Motion if the ARC would be
funded next year.

Mr. Keene said Staff was intending to bring forth during the Mid-Year a
budget recommendation to fund the ARC in FY2012 and unless directed
otherwise, the FY2013 budget would also fund the ARC.

Council Member Shepherd asked if the decision was to not fund the ARC
would there be a discussion.

Mr. Perez stated the FY2012 had approximately $10 million to fund the ARC
which was adopted by Council previously. The discussion was to return with
a recommendation to increase the amount to match the actuarial study
recommendation. The payment was not made until the end of the year so
Council could direct Staff not to make a payment.

Council Member Shepherd asked if the payment was due at the end of the
physical year or fiscal year.

Mr. Keene confirmed the fiscal year, June 30, 2012.

Council Member Price asked what the average rate of return had been from
CalPERS assumptions over the past 5 years.

Mr. Perez said the CalPERS Trust had been up and down, he did not have
current numbers in percentages. He noted in January of 2011 it was 18
percent and as of September 30, 2011 there was a significant decrease in
the portfolio which was at $44 million and dropped by $5 million. Staff
would have the historic percentages when they returned.
