Binding Arbitration truncated the process, and the City Council did not have
a basis for comparison.

Ms. Antil stated the City compensated IEDA approximately $85,000 annually
for all labor groups.

Mayor Burt stated he believed the inquiry was based on the concern for
whether the City would have a greater or lower expense if the City held
Binding Arbitration. He stated data would be beneficial if it did not add a lot
of workload to Staff.

Council Member Klein recommended that Staff limit the time spent on this
request to ten hours.

Mayor Burt agreed with Council Member Klein.

Council Member Shepherd stated the information missing from the Staff
Report was the number of times the City used Binding Arbitration, what the
context of Binding Arbitration was about, and how much the City saved or
lost.

Mayor Burt stated the inquiry was for additional labor negotiation costs, in
addition to the number of times the City used Binding Arbitration, what they
were about, and how much the City saved or lost.

Council Member Price inquired whether the request included the costs
incurred and shared with Fire Fighter personnel, and what the results were
of those rulings from Binding Arbitration.

Mayor Burt recommended that a Motion be brought forth by a Council
Member for a complex request of Staff.

Council Member Yeh requested Staff to work on this request for up to ten
hours.

Ms. Antil acknowledged Council Member Yeh’s request.

Mayor Burt stated Staff’s first priority would be to provide the history of
rulings on Binding Arbitration. He stated the second priority would be on
any insights Staff may have on comparative costs.
