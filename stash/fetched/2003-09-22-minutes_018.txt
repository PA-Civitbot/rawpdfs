Mayor Mossar asked the maker of the motion if he would accept the
clarification.

Vice Mayor Beecham accepted it to be incorporated into the motion.

Council Member Ojakian asked if the concern was over cut-through
traffic on the matrix on items 1 and 2.

Mr. Emslie replied yes, but it was tempered with a need to maintain
the travel time.

Council Member Ojakian said some delay was not a bad thing.

Mr. Kott said the intention was mobility, not to intentionally impose
delay and congestion on motorists.

Council Member Ojakian asked if quality of life was affected if traffic
delayed an individual.

Mr. Kott said transportation would not design for delay.

Council Member Ojakian said the substitute motion spoke about quality
of life being affected or issues about safety. Items 3 and 4 dealt with
safety and other items helped improve quality of life. Cut-through
traffic concerns could be addressed with performance measures.

Council Member Lytle said she disagreed with comments about
deciding land use and transportation decisions separately. The land
use decisions would be made before any of the performance measures
were tested. She was concerned about the amount of cars being
added and the time of the day the cars would be going through the
Corridor.

Vice Mayor Beecham said staff had come forward                 with    a
recommendation, which was challenging and aggressive.

Council Member Kleinberg referred to the Attachment B matrix and
asked why some intersections would operate less efficiently if others
operated more efficiently.

Mr. Kott said there was a tradeoff of added delay to a high level of
service intersection with a limited delay for the improved efficiency of
a downstream intersection.
