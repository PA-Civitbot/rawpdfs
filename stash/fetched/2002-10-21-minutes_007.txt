was aware that dump trucks carrying dirt and other heavy loads
were not able to turn onto Oregon Expressway from Alma Street
because of the tight turns.

CONSENT CALENDAR

Wei Wang, 3054 Price Court, spoke regarding Item No. 4. She
urged the Council not to approve using taxpayer money to
construct a concrete wall that was detrimental to the
environment. She proposed the alternative of soundproof windows
and doors, and an acoustic-type 8-foot wood wall.

Council Member Morton would not participate on Item No. 4 due to
a conflict of interest because he was the Founder of Community
Skating, Inc.

Council Member    Freeman removed Item No. 8 to become Item No.
20B. She asked     whether the information coming from the Storm
Drain Committee    would have any effect on the upgrading project
as described in   Item No. 15.

Director of Public Works Glenn Roberts said the upgrading
project for the storm drains was already scheduled to occur.
Funding for the project would come from revenues generated from
a prior bond sale on the previous rate structure and was
independent of new actions and recommendations.

Council Member Kishimoto removed Item Nos. 7 and 14 to become
Item Nos. 20A and 18A.

Council Member Lytle would not participate in Item No. 15 due to
a conflict of interest because she owned a residence in the
affected area.

Council Member Kishimoto related to her colleagues there was a
new policy document attached to the resolution in Item No. 17,
which incorporated the Council's requested changes.
