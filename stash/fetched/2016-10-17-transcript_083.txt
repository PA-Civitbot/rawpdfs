Vice Mayor Scharff: I don't know if 17 feet is the right number. I don't
know that. I do believe that—everyone tells me you need the larger ground-
floor retail. I hear that from everyone. I'd like to see that in the Downtown.
I don't see any downside to it.

Council Member Holman: I guess the question for Staff is do we really
need—I don't know if we need that in here. You're not accepting it except
we don't want to see it in SOFA. You're agreed to that.

Vice Mayor Scharff: I agree to that.

AMENDMENT:    Council Member Holman moved, seconded by Council
Member XX to add to the Motion, “eliminate 17 foot first floor height
standards.”

Council Member Holman: We're not going to change SOFA.

Vice Mayor Scharff: Correct.

Council Member Holman: Eliminate in SOFA. How to best deal with SOFA,
maybe we just need to say we're not going to change the design standards
that exist in SOFA. It has its own compatibility standards, so we're just ...

Mayor Burt: Before we leave this, do we really mean eliminate a mandated
height for retail? Not 17 feet per se. I'm looking at the wording.

Council Member Holman: What probably would be better is if we just made
a blanket statement about SOFA that we're not looking to amend the design
standards in SOFA. That would cover this and other things as well. Don't
alter the design standards in SOFA II.

Mayor Burt: Take out this preceding sentence.

Council Member Holman:      Take out "eliminate the 17-foot."    Is that okay
with you, Vice Mayor?

Vice Mayor Scharff: Yeah.

Council Member Holman: And Liz?

Council Member Kniss: Yes.

AMENDMENT RESTATED AND INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION
WITH THE CONSENT OF THE MAKER AND SECONDER to add to the
Motion, “no alterations to Design Criteria in SOFA II.” (New Part C)
