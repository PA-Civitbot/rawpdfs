                               MINUTES

Vice Mayor Shepherd stated the list of agencies needed to be approved by
the Council.

Council Member Price agreed.

Council Member Klein preferred to leave Liaisons to the Mayor's discretion.

Mayor Scharff did not support the Amendment. The City had a list of Boards
and Commissions and CBOs, and none had been added to the list since he
became a Council Member.

AMENDMENT PASSED: 5-4 Berman, Klein, Kniss, Scharff no

AMENDMENT: Mayor Scharff moved, seconded by Vice Mayor Shepherd to
add to H2 “where appointed by the Council, Mayor, or Agency should” after
“Liaisons.”

Council Member Burt noted the Mayor appointed a Liaison to the Valley
Transportation Authority (VTA) Policy Advisory Committee; however, the
agency selected the Liaison for the VTA.

Mayor Scharff believed being elected to a position and being appointed to a
position was different. He would agree to include being appointed by an
agency, because the Council set up the Council Member to be appointed by
the agency.

Council Member Burt expressed concern that the Council did not review each
position.

MOTION AS AMENDED PASSED: 9-0

17.   Colleagues Memo Requesting that the Staff and Planning and
      Transportation Commission (PTC) Review Sidewalk Widths With a
      Focus on El Camino Real and the Grand Boulevard Plan and Return to
      Council with Suggested Zoning Amendments.

Penny Ellson appreciated the Colleague's Memo. Because of her work in the
community, she understood the importance of sidewalks to street life.
Sidewalks along El Camino Real were important, because housing was being
built there and kids used it as a route to school.
