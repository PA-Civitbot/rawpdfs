objections against the weed abatement assessments, the Resolution passed
by the Council on this matter will reflect the finding.

MOTION:      Council Member Klein moved, seconded by Drekmeier, to
approve staff’s recommendation to hear and consider objections from
affected property owners of proposed assessments related to completed
weed abatement work and adopt the resolution to approve and/or modify
the assessments for weed abatement.
