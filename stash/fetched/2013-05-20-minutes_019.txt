Vice Mayor Shepherd assumed Staff would return with scenarios for funding
after the PTC reviewed them. If the Amendment changed Staff's work, then
she would incorporate it into the Motion.

Mr. Williams did not believe the Amendment changed Staff's work. Staff
expected that the analysis would include a review of financial options and
the range of possibilities.

Vice Mayor Shepherd agreed to remove part 1 from the Motion.

Council Member Berman requested Staff provide a list of dates of when Staff
expected to present the various aspects of the parking proposals and the
broader Downtown Cap Study.

Mr. Keene would do so. He anticipated discussion at the scheduled Retreat
would include a review of action items for the three Council Priorities, which
would involve the parking issue.

Council Member Schmid requested the schedule of dates include the financial
options.
