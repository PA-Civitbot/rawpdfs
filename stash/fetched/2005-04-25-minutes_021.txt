Council Member Morton asked whether the base of the antenna needed to be
so wide.

Mayor Burch said he preferred the antenna be a pole rather than an artificial
tree.

Council Member Morton asked whether the neighbors wanted a large
artificial tree.

Mayor Burch said he wanted the pole to look like a cell phone antenna.

Council Member Morton said Mr. Dockter should speak to the aesthetics of
an artificial tree.

Managing Arborist Dave Dockter said the artificial tree was designed to blend
with the surrounding trees.

Council Member Morton said there would be maintenance of the landscaping.
