Mr. Rodriguez indicated Staff developed the west route in 2011 as part of a
community outreach process. Outreach participants requested service to
Stanford University Medical Center (SUMC) and Palo Alto Medical
Foundation.

Council Member Scharff suggested Staff provide outreach to Facebook.

Council Member Burt did not hear Staff comment regarding the historic
experience of Palo Alto's shuttle program, and was concerned that Staff and
the Council were using anecdotal information. Benches and awnings at
shuttle stops were needed. Proposed shuttle routes should be presented to
the PTC for full review. He inquired about the headway time for the VTA 22
and 522 bus lines on El Camino Real.

Mr. Rodriguez did not have VTA headway information with him.

Council Member Burt believed the headway was 12-15 minutes. He asked
about the headway time for the proposed west shuttle route.

Mr. Rodriguez replied one hour for the route shown in red only.

Council Member Burt added that the VTA bus stopped frequently along the
22 and 522 routes.

Mr. Rodriguez remarked that the VTA route did not serve the Palo Alto
community as intended within the west shuttle route.

Council Member Burt felt the City should market the VTA service in Palo Alto
rather than increasing service along El Camino Real.

Mr. Aknin added that respondents would opine on cost efficiencies and
review redundancy in service during the RFP process. VTA headway along El
Camino Real could improve when Bus Rapid Transit was implemented in a
few years.

Council Member Burt asked if that would be Bus Rapid Transit rather than
dedication of a lane of El Camino Real.

Mr. Aknin responded yes.

Council Member Burt understood the headway would be 10 minutes under
Bus Rapid Transit.

Mr. Aknin concurred.
