Vice Mayor Scharff called for questions from the Council.

Council Member Burt asked if applicant would pay for the tree plantings.

Ms. French answered yes.

Council Member Burt inquired if trees would disrupt transmission once they
grew to the height of the antenna.

Ms. French asked if he was referring to an alternate location.

Council Member Burt asked for clarification of trees blocking transmission.

Ms. French said given that there is an existing tree and looking at the
interference that tree might cause loss of transmission.

Council Member Burt asked if his assumption that an existing, mature tree
would block the antenna, whereas the new trees would block the box rather
than the antenna, was correct.

Ms. French answered yes.

Council Member Burt inquired if the Council granted approval on this issue,
would it also enable any additional pole installation which would not be
subject to ARB review in the future.

Mr. Williams indicated there was still a process, but it would not be subject
to the full ARB review.

Council Member Burt asked if the Council could limit approval to the
proposed 20 installations only in order to review subsequent alternatives in
design, equipment and locations.

Ms. French answered yes, as the application before the Council concerned
only the 20 installations.
