3.   (Old Item No. 1) Approval of a Resolution Proposing an Increase in the
     Monthly Storm Drainage Fee from $4.25 to $10.00 per Equivalent
     Residential Unit (ERU) and Approved and Related Resolution

Council Member Cordell said she pulled the item because she had continued
concerns about holding the special election.

Council Member Kleinberg said she wanted to hear further details from the
public.

Council Member Morton said he was concerned the measure could be
passed, but believed the election should go forward.

Council Member Mossar said the type of storm drain system for the
community would be determined by public vote on the fee increase.

Council Member Freeman said she had concerns about the residential survey
conducted to obtain a general opinion about the fee. The measure would
need to pass with 50 percent of the residents who voted.

Vice Mayor Burch said the Blue Ribbon Committee recommended increasing
the monthly storm drainage fee.

Council Member Kishimoto said there were better packages of projects and
information to convey to the public.
