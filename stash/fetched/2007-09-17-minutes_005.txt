4A. (Old Item 3) Request for Approval to Cancel October 8, November 5 and
    November 12 Regular Council Meetings and to Schedule a Special
    Council Meeting on November 13.

MOTION: Council Member Mossar moved, seconded by Klein, to cancel the
October 8 and November 12 Regular Council Meetings but not the November
5 meeting, and to Schedule a Special Council Meeting on November 13.

Council Member Kleinberg inquired about the meeting on November 13. She
noted there is a Policy and Services (P&S) meeting scheduled for that night,
so there is a conflict.

Assistant City Manager Harrison said tentatively the P&S meeting would be
held on Wednesday rather than Tuesday.

Council Member Kleinberg said she probably would not be able to participate
on November 13 because Golden Guardian is scheduled on that date.
