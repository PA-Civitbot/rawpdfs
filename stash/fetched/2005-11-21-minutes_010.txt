Council Member Beecham said substantial changes would be needed.

Council Member Morton said a friendly amendment would not be accepted,
as it required more work from the staff.

Council Member Beecham asked when the plan would return.

Ms. Harrison said final updates would not normally return to the Council.
The Emergency Plan reflected the Utilities Organization, which needed to be
settled prior to updating the plan.

Council Member Freeman asked the City Attorney whether the City would be
legally obligated if the names of the entities were not changed.

Mr. Baum said there would not be legal liabilities; only functional problems
or embarrassment.

AMENDMENT WITHDRAWN BY MAKER noting her concerns were on the
record.

MOTION PASSED 9-0.

Council Member Mossar stated she was surprised the emergency planning
was not up to date.

Ms. Harrison said only the documentation was not up to date. There were
procedures and policies being followed, but not documented. There was well
coordinated emergency planning and the Utilities Department was an
integral part.

Council Member Mossar said statements indicated the reorganization of the
Utilities Department was needed prior to updating the emergency plan. She
clarified the emergency planning was up to date and practiced, but the
documentation was not.

Ms. Harrison said the chart needed to indicate the current individuals
responsible for the various emergency response functions. These individuals
knew, and had been trained in their responsibilities in, the regular exercises
for emergency response.       They were represented on the emergency
response steering committee and working groups.

Council Member Mossar said it would be appropriate to return to the Council
when the documentation had been remedied.           She asked when the
documentation would be updated.
