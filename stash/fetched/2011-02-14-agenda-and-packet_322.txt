                                                                                                       a

                   b) Council to Track Contacts. Council Members will use their best
                   efforts to track contacts pertaining to such identified quasi-judicial
                   decision items. Contacts include conversations, meetings, site visits,
                   mailings, or presentations during which substantial factual
                   information about the item is gathered by or submitted to the Council
                   Member.

                   c) Disclosure. When the item is presented to the Council for
                   hearing, Council Members will disclose any contacts which have
                   significantly influenced their preliminary views or opinions about the
                   item. The disclosure may be oral or written, and should explain the
                   substance of the contact so that other Council Members, interested
                   parties, and the public will have an opportunity to become apprised




                                                                                                           Attachment: 2.15.11 (1422 : Policy and Services Agenda 2/15/2011)
                   of the factors influencing the Council's decision and to attempt to
                   controvert or rebut any such factor during the hearing. Disclosure
                   alone will not be deemed sufficient basis for a request to continue the
                   item. A contact or the disclosure of a contact shall not be deemed
                   grounds for disqualification of a Council Member from participation
                   in a quasi-judicial decision unless the Council Member determines
                   that the nature of the contact is such that it is not possible for the
                   Council Member to reach an impartial decision on the item.

                   d) No Contacts after Hearings. Following closure of the hearing,
                   and prior to a final decision, Council Members will refrain from any
                   contacts pertaining to the item, other than clarifying questions
                   directed to City staff.

           3. Written Findings Required. On any matter for which state law or City
           ordinance requires the preparation of written findings, the staff report and
           other materials submitted on the matter will contain findings proposed for
           adoption by the Council. Any motion directly or impliedly rejecting the
           proposed findings must include a statement of alternative or modified
           findings or a direction that the matter under consideration be continued for a
           reasonable period of time in order for staff to prepare a new set of proposed
           findings consistent with the evidence which has been presented and the
           decision which is anticipated.

            4. Rules of Evidence. Council hearings need not be conducted according to
            formal rules of evidence. Any relevant evidence may be considered if it is
            the sort of evidence upon which responsible persons rely in the conduct of
            serious affairs. The presiding officer may exclude irrelevant or redundant
            testimony and may make such other rulings as may be necessary for the
            orderly conduct of the proceedings while ensuring basic fairness and full
