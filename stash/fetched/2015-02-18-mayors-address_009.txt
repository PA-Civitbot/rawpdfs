But actually, Palo Alto is really all of these for a number of practical reasons.




So how do we preserve both to the benefit of the community.


Slide $6.50

When downtown monthly retail rents climb to these dollar amounts per square foot, you
know it’s hard to retain retail here in Palo Alto.

Slide $7.50

And when the common range of office rates climb to $7.50 and up to over $8 per square
foot in the greater downtown area and over $6 per square foot on California Avenue, it
also exacerbates the ability to retain a presence in Palo Alto.

With these high rents for both residential and business, how do we retain the diversity
that has been a part of our community.
