Ms. Erickson added there were significant training hours needed for the new
SAP Program.

Council Member Freeman asked for clarification on the percentage of home
recycling being down a point from the past year; however, the Auditor
provided a figure in her presentation that indicated Palo Alto was doing
better.

Ms. Erickson said her presentation figure reflected total tons.

Council Member Freeman raised concern of various characteristics in the
community. Overall appearance of Palo Alto was 86 percent; opportunities
to attend cultural events was 83 percent; openness and acceptance was
down to 73 percent, and she would like to see a percentage increase in
working with the government.     She questioned the employee-training
budget.

Council Member Beecham said more focus was needed on the Streets
Reconstructive Expenditures, which was lower than other cities, and the
significant drop in the past year of residents dissatisfied with Storm Drains.
The expense on vehicle maintenance was higher than other cities. He asked
whether other cost benefits needed to be reviewed.

Ms. Erickson said added research may be required but other cities may be
using vehicles differently than Palo Alto.

Council Member Beecham noted Jobs/Housing imbalance being higher than
other cities. Compared to Mountain View, Palo Alto had twice as many jobs
per resident and noted Code Enforcement and Police operating expenses
were high.

Mayor Burch commended Ms. Erickson on the Report. It was an excellent
study and, since it was completed with questions used nationwide, it was a
good across-the-states comparison.
