SPECIAL ORDERS OF THE DAY

1.    Summer Science Program (Heidelberg)

Thomas Fehrenbach, Economic Development Manager, advised that the City
was exploring a Smart City Partnership with Heidelberg, Germany. This was
an opportunity to highlight the Summer Science School, a program
sponsored by Heidelberg.

Sarah, senior at Gunn High School, attended the International Summer
Science School in Heidelberg, Germany, to learn about science in a different
way. Students chose one field of science on which to focus and over one
month researched a project, conducted experiments, and attended
workshops.

Owen, senior at Palo Alto High School, added that one feature of the
program was exposure to German culture.          He interacted with local
students, took trips to neighboring cities, and was generally immersed in
German culture. Students from around the world attended the program.

Sarah made lasting friendships with some of the 23 students from 10
countries.

Owen thanked John Ernest Foundation for providing an opportunity to attend
the Summer Science School.

Mr. Fehrenbach noted Nicole Huber, Chief of Staff for Heidelberg, was
visiting the City.

Alexander Johnson, John Ernest Foundation, reported the goal of the John
Ernest Foundation was to turn dreams into reality for individuals. The John
Ernest Foundation attempted to reflect the diversity and complexity of the
human spirit.

Council Member Berman inquired about the students' activities in the science
labs.
