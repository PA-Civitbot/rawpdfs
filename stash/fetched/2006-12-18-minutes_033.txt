Council Member Drekmeier stated he has been very appreciative of Mayor
Kleinberg’s role in allowing him to feel very engaged as a new member of
the Council. He also noted a member of the SEIU advised him there was an
RFP issued to contract out park maintenance.

Mr. Benest said the Auditor’s Report on Park Maintenance recommended
contracting out the work to cut costs and maintain the service level. This
was included as part of the $3 million solution and is being explored through
an RFP. SEIU acknowledges the City has the right to outsource this work.

Mayor Kleinberg wished everyone a wonderful holiday season.
