Council Member Ojakian did not believe the Council should vote on the
issue because two colleagues were not present to participate.

Vice Mayor Beecham asked the maker and seconder to withdraw the
motion and asked staff when they would return with a proposal on
Channing and Homer Avenues.

Mr. Benest said a major traffic effort was going on with Charleston
Avenue and asked that the Council hold off on a decision for Channing
and Homer Avenues. The issue was controversial.

Mr. Emslie stated that staff was unable to take on any new projects at
the current time. Committing to a time frame was difficult without
doing a level of analysis. The Council was urged to allow staff to
complete its current work plan.

MOTION WITHDRAWN BY MAKER AND SECONDER

Ms. Furth explained that the SOFA policy framework said, “evaluate
reestablishing Homer Avenue and Channing Avenue as two-way
streets in order to reduce speed and impact to traffic through the
residential and mixed use neighborhood.”

Vice Mayor Beecham said the question was the Council was unsure
how best to reestablish Homer and Channing Avenues.

Council Member Lytle said she wanted to reaffirm the Council wanted
to address the issue.

MOTION: Council Member Lytle moved, seconded by Kishimoto, that
the Council reaffirm its commitment to evaluate a two-way conversion
on Homer and Channing Avenues and for staff to return to Council with
options.

Council Member Burch said he heard the Council committed itself to
make Channing and Homer Avenues two-way.

Vice Mayor Beecham said the Council would bring back options to
make a decision.

Council Member Kleinberg saw the action as an unnecessary vote. The
Council was committed to the policy framework. Staff said it would be
done.
