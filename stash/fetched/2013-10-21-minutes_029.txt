Peter Pirnejad, Development Services Director, reported Staff recommended
the Council adopt eight Ordinances which would adopt by reference the
various parts of the 2013 California Building Standards Code. Seven of the
Ordinances contained proposed local amendments to the State Model Codes
along with the necessary findings of fact supporting each local amendment.
Every three years, the State of California adopted new building standards,
codified in Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations. Upon publication of
the new Building Standards Codes, local jurisdictions were allowed 180 days
to amend the modern State Codes to enact more stringent local building
standards. Local amendments had to be supported with findings based on
unique local, climactic, geologic and topographic conditions. Staff worked
with neighboring jurisdictions to ensure consistency and uniformity of Code
enforcement throughout the region. Staff planned to hold technical training
sessions to discuss details of the changes on October 30, 2013 and, if
needed, in November 2013.
