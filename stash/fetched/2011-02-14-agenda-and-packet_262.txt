                                                                                                             10.d




 1   that transportation consultant when they are on board through that process to say take 15 percent
 2   of the planned trips and put them on this street because that is more likely, put 30 percent here,
 3   and put 20 percent there. That is analysis that has yet to occur because the concept really isn’t
 4   ready yet.




                                                                                                                    Attachment: Attachment D: P&TC Excerpt Minutes of January 12, 2011 (1320 : California Avenue Neg Dec and CIP)

 6   Commissioner Tanaka: Okay. Some of the design issues that members of public brought up like
 7   for instance wider sidewalks, perhaps back in parking, perhaps even routing shuttles on Oregon
 8   instead of California Avenue, those would be taken care of during the design phase.
 9
10   Mr. Rodriguez: That is right. Actually we will take care of a lot of the questions. Actually, one
11   that came up during the community meeting process that we didn’t talk about tonight is lighting.
12   What we are going to do during the design process is we are going to ask our design consultants
13   to look at adding pedestrian scale lighting to California Avenue. It isn’t something that is funded
14   as part of the grant. I have to make that really clear. We are very fortunate that we are still in a
15   very good construction environment where bid pricing is still very low. I actually expect the
16   same to occur through the design process. So we want to have probably as an alternate item
17   during the design for construction additions of additional lighting on the street. We probably
18   won’t change out the existing but just add lighting to be more cost conservative or cost savings
19   wise.

21   Commissioner Tanaka: Great, thank you.
22
23   Chair Tuma: Okay, with that Commissioners are we ready to vote? All right. All those in favor
24   of the motion signify by saying aye. (ayes) All those opposed? That passes unanimously seven
25   to zero. Thank you.
