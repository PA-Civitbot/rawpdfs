the level of community building and supported the County proposed project.

Penny Ellison, 563 El Capitan Place, supported the City Staff

the safety for all non-vehicular traffic.

Mike Aberg, 757 Moreno Avenue, supported the Ross Road alternative.

Pam Radin, 877 Ames, supported the alternative on Ross Road.

Christopher Sine, 2332 Middlefield Road, stated there were environmental
issues with removing or moving trees and that was why he supported the
Middlefield Road alternative.

for completion in 2010 but now the alternative proposal was slated for
completion in 2011. She requested the completion sooner than later to

were discussed as traffic calming rather than for aesthetics.
