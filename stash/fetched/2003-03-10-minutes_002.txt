APPROVAL OF MINUTES

Vice Mayor Beecham noted that City Clerk Donna Rogers requested the
January 27, 2003, City Council minutes be removed from the agenda.

MOTION: Council Member Morton moved, seconded by Burch, to approve
the minutes of January 21, 2003, as corrected.

Vice Mayor Beecham said the word “manic” was added by one of his
colleagues as a correction to the Council minutes of November 12, 2002. The
colleague summarized the City Manager’s comments as, “The City Manager
found that the charges of Councilmanic interference or undue influence on
staff were invalid.” He found that the November 12, 2002, sense minutes
were nearly identical to the transcription he did of the minutes. He would
vote approval of the changes recommended by his colleague to be
incorporated in the minutes but did not find that the City Manager used the
word, “manic.”

Council Member Lytle said the word was her characterization in the minutes.

Council Member Kleinberg clarified the two amendments to the minutes of
January 21, 2003, were quotes from Council Member Lytle.
