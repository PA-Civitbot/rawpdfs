moving forward on some of the necessary steps on Measure E. The
recommendation also set in place some of the technical work needed to
proceed with the cap design and closure of the landfill.

Mayor Yeh thanked the Staff for the presentation and opened the floor to
Council questions. He indicated there were several public speakers to the
item and that Council comments and potential Motions would be held until
after public comment.

Council Member Schmid said that Hargraves did a study of the contours in
2007-2008. He questioned if the City had worked since that time to
engineer the contours that were approved in the Hargraves study.

Mr. Bobel said yes.

Council Member Schmid questioned why there was a mystery about the
Golder contract which would approve the cover on top of the contours.

Mr. Bobel said there was not a mystery. He said that if Council Member
Schmid was questioning why the City was doing it, it was because the
construction drawings do not exist. The closure plan needed to be made into
construction drawings, plans, and specifications.

Council Member Schmid questioned why there was a year delay. He asked
why it could not be done according to the Hargraves study.

Mr. Bobel said that the recommendation was to delay for one year because if
the landfill was capped now and the City Council later decided to construct a
facility on the 10 acre site it would interrupt that cap.

Council Member Schmid said he assumed that the 10 acre site was clearly
outside the boundaries, and that the Golder study would design the other 50
plus acres separately.

Mr. Bobel said it could not be constructed that way. He explained it would
not be approved by the regulatory agencies, as they would insist on a fully
engineered package.

Vice Mayor Scharff asked if rent was currently being charged for the
composting.

Mr. Bobel said yes, but that it was not new rent.
