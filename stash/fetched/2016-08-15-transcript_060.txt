Mr. Lait: Thank you, Mayor. Just a clarification on the Motion when you're
going to vote. For the redesign, if that's going to come back to the ARB or if
it's going to come back to the Council.

Mayor Burt: The maker should probably clarify that.

Council Member Holman: Yes, to the ARB.

Mayor Burt: The seconder concurs?

Council Member Holman: Actually the question is should it go to the HRB
and the ARB, because there are historic implications here. At a minimum to
the ARB.

Mr. Lait: The HRB looked at the project that's before you and did not find an
issue. We're happy to take it back if that's the Council's direction.

Mayor Burt: I would encourage that it be ARB.

Council Member Holman: The ARB, but asking Staff to be sensitive to the
issues that have been raised.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to add to the Motion, “and return to the
Architectural Review Board” after “to address the following.”

MOTION RESTATED: Council Member Holman moved, seconded by Council
Member Kniss to continue the Appeal and require redesign to address the
following and return to the Architectural Review Board:

The following Findings cannot be made:

A.   Architectural Review Board Finding Numbers 2, 5, and 6; and

B.   Context based design criteria:

       i.    (a) 1A, 2A, 2B: i, ii, iii, iv; and

       ii.   (b) 2B, 2C, 2H; and

      iii.   (b) 3B, 3D; and

      iv.    (b) 4, 4A, 4B.

Mayor Burt: Please vote on the board.              That passes on an 8-1 vote with
Council Member Wolbach voting no.

                                                                             Page 60 of 90
