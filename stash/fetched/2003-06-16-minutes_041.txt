Mayor Mossar proposed to her colleagues that the City Auditor return to the
Finance Committee with answers to pertinent questions, and that Item No.
11 (Part B) be agendized for July 7, 2003, to allow the Council the
opportunity to talk about what was important to them.

Council Member Freeman said when Item 11 (Part B) went back to the
Finance Committee, the Council would have asked the City Auditor to do
something the Finance Committee had already discussed and voted on.

Mayor Mossar said there were items in the budget document that were not
discussed at the Finance Committee meetings.

Council Member Freeman asked whether the items to be discussed in the
budget document precluded what the Council had already voted on.

Mayor Mossar said it was more about asking the City Auditor her opinion on
how to monitor a process.

City Auditor Sharon Erickson said she interpreted the memo as a clarification
of her role as the City Auditor and to answer several other questions about
possible organizational reviews.

Vice Mayor Beecham said the answer to Council Member Freeman's question
was “no”.

Council Member Morton suggested allowing the City Auditor a little more
time beyond July 7, 2003.

Mayor Mossar suggested continuing Item No. 11 (Part B) to July 7, 2003.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION RESTATED: Vice Mayor Beecham moved, seconded
by Ojakian, to direct the City Auditor to provide answers to questions in the
Colleagues memo dated June 10, 2003, from Mayor Mossar and Vice Mayor
Beecham and to return to the Finance Committee with recommendations;
and that Item 11 (Part B) be continued to the July 7, 2003, regular City
Council meeting.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION PASSED 8-1, Morton “no.”
