Mayor Burt: We don't have any latitude to exempt the project in any way,
because the ordinance is the ordinance. Right?

Ms. Silver: Exactly, yes.

Vice Mayor Scharff: What's the effect of that?

Mayor Burt: I think the effect would be that it would fall into next year's
competition.

Vice Mayor Scharff: It couldn't actually be approved either until next year.

Ms. Silver: July 1 and March 31st.

Mayor Holman: It's really 7 months.

Council Member Berman: Nine months.

Council Member Holman: It's not a year.

Mr. Lait: Yeah, it would depend on if there was 50,000 square feet and how

effective impact is a 9-month delay with uncertainty for the applicant that
they would fall within that 50,000-square-foot approval. I just don't see any
solution other than we either approve it with the consequences of the
substitute motion or return to the primary motion.          Council Member

Mr. Keene: You want to say something, Molly?

Molly Stump, City Attorney: Excuse me, Mr. Mayor.

Council Member Wolbach: I'll defer to the City Attorney, but then I'll weigh
in after that.

Ms. Stump: It is possible for the Council to amend its Ordinances. If the
Council wished to establish a special program by Ordinance, that's different
