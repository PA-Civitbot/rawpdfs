Council Member Kniss: Mayor Burt, because I think the public deserves to
know, I don't know what amount of money that is or what that would be or
where does one ...

Mayor Burt: Let's focus on that then. Does Staff have the dollar amount
thatâ€”do you know? How's it calculated?

Mr. Lait: It's seven percent of the ..

Mayor Burt: Sorry, seven percent of what?

Ms. Silver: It's seven percent of the sale of the prior unit. We don't know
until the units are sold.

Mayor Burt: That's the calculation method, seven percent of the sale of ...

Ms. Silver: The other units in the building.

Mayor Burt: That's what we can come up with.

Council Member Kniss: Thanks.

Mayor Burt: Council Member DuBois.

Council Member DuBois: I keep staring at this project and trying to see how
it fits, and I can't do it. I think the Motion is attempting to do it, but now I
think we have a motion that's just way too directive in trying to define a
building through a Motion. I think we're trying to squeeze an elephant into a
tutu, essentially. Rather than nibble around the edges, I'd like to make a
substitute Motion that we deny the project as we cannot make the site and
design findings.

Mayor Burt: You have to state what findings you can't make.

Council Member DuBois: I was going to do that in my comments, but they
need to be in the Motion?

Mayor Burt: Does that have to be part of the Motion as the basis for not
being able to make the site and design findings?

Ms. Silver: It does, unless you want us to come back at a Staff level and
come up with some findings.

Mayor Burt: I think it would be good to include the basis for the site and
design denial in the Motion.
