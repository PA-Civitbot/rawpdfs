Council Member Burt clarified 2C was an expanded Scope of Services to
review the additional options.

Mr. Williams stated that was correct.

Council Member Burt asked how much of the design cost was attributable to
evaluating the additional options the Council had asked to be considered.

Mr. Rodriguez stated the base project cost of $295,000 included the
development options for consideration by the Council to review the
alternatives for improvements along California Avenue so the expanded
scope being referred to was a part of the base cost.

Council Member Burt confirmed the vote was to reaffirm the consulting
services which included the expanded Scope of Work.

Mr. Rodriguez stated yes.

Ms. Stump clarified line item 2C was added in an abundance of caution; the
court did not disturb the contractual agreement between the City and the
consultant. Staff wanted to ensure although other items had been rescinded
the contract had remained intact.

Council Member Burt said there were a number of speakersâ€™ comments on
how the redesign might affect the economic vitality. A number of the
downtown areas cited were two-lane through streets with a greater number
of volumes than that of California Avenue.

Mr. Rodriguez stated that was correct.

Council Member Burt asked if Staff had the volume numbers for Castro
Street and University Avenue.

Mr. Rodriguez showed slides where California Avenue reflected one-third the
volume of the other four downtown areas mentioned.

Council Member Burt confirmed the other four areas had two-lanes.

Mr. Rodriguez said that was correct.

Council Member Burt asked if the Staff knew the economic vitality impacts
from the City of Mountain View when Castro Street reduced from four to two
lanes.
