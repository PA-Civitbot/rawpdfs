Council Member Morton asked about the effect of going back to a date where
a public discussion was held regarding the City Council’s intent to deal with
climate change issues and if it was acceptable to use that date for all
projects in the pipeline as of that date subject to this Ordinance.

Ms. Bartell stated there was no concern with using that date.

Council Member Morton stated that with that confirmation he supported the
Amendment and would urge the other Council Members to do the same.

Mayor Klein stated his clarification that any projects submitted prior to that
date would be exempt.

Council Member Morton stated that any projects that entered the pipeline
after that date would be subject to this Ordinance.

Mr. Williams asked for clarification between applications submitted for
planning entitlements and building permits. He asked if this Ordinance
would apply if something were submitted for a building permit after
December 7, 2007.

Mayor Klein stated that if it were submitted after December 7 it would be
subject to the rules.

Mr. Baum stated his request for clarification regarding the use of the word
‘application’.

Mayor Klein stated he was referring to all commercial projects using the
language in the Climate Protection Plan where it distinguishes between
commercial and residential.

Mr. Baum stated that if any of these projects had received a building permit
at this point then it would be a different issue. He stated that perhaps the
process is long enough that none of the projects submitted since December
could have received a building permit.

Mr. Williams stated that it is possible that in six months something could
have received a building permit.

Mr. Baum stated that if Mayor Klein excluded items that had received
building permits, then there would be no legal considerations.

Mayor Klein agreed to the exclusion of items that had already received
building permits.
