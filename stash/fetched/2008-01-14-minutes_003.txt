The Palo Alto Public Art Commission participated in a joint meeting with City
Council on January 14, 2008. During 2006-07 the Commission’s major focus

condition and storage of the City’s two-dimensional art collection.

Projects completed during the year included the Children’s Library Mural by
artist Jeff Petersen, and the selection process for the Mitchell Park Sculpture
Competition which is scheduled for completion in spring, 2008. Michael
