when this opportunity had become available the Association approached the
City.

Council Member Klein stated the naming process required a clear policy to
be followed in order to ensure accuracy and consistency. He asked if the
plaza was determined not suitable as a park, would the PARC have had a
part in the naming.

Mr. Betts stated the naming policy read: it would be referred to the
Commission or Committee which had a sphere of influence. He noted
because of the landscaping and general recreational nature of the area, it fell
under the jurisdiction of the PARe.

Council Member Klein asked what type of recreation occurred at the area.

Mr. Betts stated there were benches provided where residents could read,
relax or enjoy the views.

Council Member Klein asked who determined the facility was significant
enough to warrant a name.

Mr. Betts stated the original request was presented by previous Council
Member Kishimoto, while she was in office.

Council Member Klein asked if the policy indicated the naming of a facility
could occur with no more than one request.

Mr. Betts clarified that the plaza was a City facility and supplying a name
added a pOint of reference to its location.

Mayor Burt asked if the question was the merits of this particular plaza being
named and after whom.

Council Member Klein stated yes. He felt the process needed to be amended
to ensure the Council decided by a majority vote whether a City facility
needed a name.

MOTION:     Vice Mayor Espinosa moved, seconded by Council Member
Schmid to adopt a Resolution naming the parcel of land adjacent to the
plaza on High Street between University and Hamilton Avenues as "Anna
Zschokke Plaza"

MOTION PASSED: 9-0
