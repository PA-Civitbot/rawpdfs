Ms. Stump: We did a variety of conflicts work on this item. There are a
number of different individual circumstances. Facts can change. As far as
we know, Council Members who are able to be here tonight will be able to be
here when it comes back.

Vice Mayor Kniss: That's the explanation. We anticipate there will be eight
members who can vote on the RPP when it returns. Correct? Unless
something happens between now and then?

Ms. Stump: Or there's an absence or depending on when it comes back.

Vice Mayor Kniss: All I'm saying is eight members have the ability, if they
are in the chambers, to vote. Why don't I drop that one. Why don't we just
say we hope there are a number of people here that night who can vote on
that item.

None.

Council Member Questions, Comments and Announcements

Vice Mayor Kniss: Are there any other comments, announcements that
anyone wants to make? Tom.

Council Member DuBois: I just want to say a lot of us were at the Chinese
New Year event, which was awesome. The second year, I think it's getting
bigger and bigger. I'm looking forward to it next year. We need a larger
location, but it was a lot of fun.

Vice Mayor Kniss: I have pictures of one of my colleagues dancing, if any of
you would like to ever see her dancing. It wasn't Karen. Anybody else want
to add something to prolong the meeting?           Nothing?  In that case
everybody, we are adjourned.

Adjournment: The meeting was adjourned at 12:25 A.M.
