Council Member Shepherd stated neighborhoods with underground utilities
would not have access to a DAS system; however, she understood
completion of underground utilities would take multiple decades. She felt an
explanation would help the Community understand the relationship between
this project and the undergrounding project.

Tomm Marshall, Assistant Director Utilities, explained the licensing
agreement contained a provision allowing antennas to be placed on street
light poles. He stated the DAS antennas would be placed on street light
poles in neighborhoods with underground utilities.

Council Member Shepherd asked if some neighborhoods would have
underground utilities soon.

Mr. Marshall indicated Staff was working through that issue.

Council Member Shepherd felt undergrounding utilities was an Enterprise
Fund project rather than a General Fund project. She asked if there would
be a boost in coverage with use of the DAS antennas.

Mr. Williams stated that was a question for AT&T, but he noted AT&T's
coverage map indicated there was better coverage.

Council Member Shepherd inquired if AT&T could respond now.

Ms. French noted the map in the Council Packet indicated the locations of
the antennas.

Council Member Espinosa noted the Council could not mandate the use of
shared towers on public facilities or public land. He asked if approval of the
current proposal would raise issues in future discussions of a Master Plan or
shared use.

Mr. Williams stated the discussion would include incentives to make approval
automatic, and possibly financial incentives. He indicated Staff would put
together a package of incentives as well as outlining pole locations.

Council Member Espinosa inquired whether Staff thought the Council was
missing an opportunity to have AT&T be a part of the Master Plan for the
Community.
