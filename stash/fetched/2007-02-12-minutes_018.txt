in contact and understand the operations and not be filtered by staff.

Mr. Benest said that was not a problem.

moving forward.

but contained internal reviews and disclosure to the Council of transactions
executed under the agreements.

Council Member Kleinberg asked about disclosure after they were signed.

Ms. Erickson said yes.
