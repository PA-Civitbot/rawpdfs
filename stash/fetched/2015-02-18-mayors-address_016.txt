Slide         donkeys




Because it is the number of resident donkeys we have here. If you don’t know, that is
Perry on the left, who was the model for the donkey in the movie Shrek, and Niner on
the right. This is February, and these guys are sweethearts. They’ll eat out of your hand
or try to eat your jacket, but either way they are gentle creatures, and we are most
fortunate to have them in our community.

This is also a matter of Community Stewardship. They rely on donations for their room
and board and on neighbors who take them on walks. If you’d like to make a donation to
their care, you can visit Acterra’s website and make a tax-deductible donation.
