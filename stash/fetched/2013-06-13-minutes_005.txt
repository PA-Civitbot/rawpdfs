Council Member Berman asked where the setback began for the proposed
project.

Mr. Aknin stated the sidewalk would be constructed on the property, so
setbacks would be measured from the curb. With the sidewalk, the setback
would appear smaller.

Council Member Berman noted the current proposal was a 5-foot sidewalk
with 11 or12 feet of yard to the house, for a total setback of either 16 or 17
feet on Maybell Avenue.

Mr. Aknin agreed.

Council Member Berman inquired about the requirements for the 35 percent
density bonus.

Mr. Wong reported the developer had to provide either 10 percent very-low-
income or up to 20 percent low-income housing to be eligible under the
Density Bonus Law.

Council Member Berman asked if the City could alter the density bonus.

Mr. Wong responded no. Density bonus was by right under State law.

Council Member Berman inquired whether a traffic study would be required
for a development under R-2 and RM-2 zoning.

Mr. Wong indicated no traffic study would be needed under R-2 zoning.

Mr. Aknin reported an environmental review would be performed, but it
probably would not trigger the need for a full traffic study.

Council Member Berman asked if the City could limit development to 8 units
per acre under existing zoning.

Cara Silver, Senior Assistant City Attorney, explained the City could not
force the developer to build a lesser project if the developer requested an
item that was permitted by right.

Council Member Berman inquired whether the developer could construct up
to 46 single-family homes on the property under the Density Bonus Law.

Ms. Silver replied yes.
