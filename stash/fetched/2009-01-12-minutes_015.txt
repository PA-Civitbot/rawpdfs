Brian Schmidt, Committee for Green Foothills, spoke on the group’s
involvement in open space in Palo Alto and said Byxbee Park should go back
to natural open space.

David Schrom spoke on his prior letter sent to Council and issues over
Byxbee Park and composting in the same area.

MOTION: Council Member Burt moved, seconded by Council Member
Barton that the Council direct Staff to create a Blue Ribbon Task Force
(BRTF) to evaluate and recommend alternatives to address Palo Alto’s
composting needs:

   1) The Task Force would A) convene for approximately 6 months, B)
      members would be chosen in a manner similar to City Commissioners,
      C) candidates would submit an application. A three member City
      Council sub-committee appointed by the Mayor would determine the
      size and membership of the Task Force.

   2) The City shall suspend accepting commercial garbage at the Palo Alto
      dump while awaiting City Council action on the recommendations of
      the BRTF.

   3) The City Manager would determine the City Staff liaison and
      appropriate City Staff support to the BRTF.

For each alternative solution or technology, the BRTF would evaluate the
following:

   1) Short Term Improvements
        a. How might the City reduce the impacts and improve the
            operation of our existing windrow composting.

   2) Environmental Impacts
        a. The environmental impacts of the alternative technologies
            including, but not limited to footprint, odor, dust and noise
            impacts.
        b. Ability to compost food waste and sewage sludge.
        c. Production of renewable energy in the process and greenhouse
            gas impacts.


   3) Economic Impacts
