     DISCUSSION:

     The proposed project is required by the City of Palo Alto to undergo Architectural Review. The intent
     of this review is to (1) Promote orderly and harmonious development in the city; (2) Enhance the
     desirability of residence or investment in the city; (3) Encourage the attainment of the most desirable
     use of land and improvements; (4) Enhance the desirability of living conditions upon the immediate
     site or in adjacent areas; and (5) Promote visual environments which are of high aesthetic quality and
     variety and which, at the same time, are considerate of each other. The proposed improvements are
     anticipated to have a less than significant aesthetic impact due to the required conformance with the
     Architectural Review requirements.

     Mitigation Measures: None Required
