                                     ramifications.

                                     (g) Approval of funding applications, such as grants or




                                                                                                               Attachment: 2.15.11 (1422 : Policy and Services Agenda 2/15/2011)
                                     loans, provided that Council has previously approved
                                     the general program or activity.

                                     (h) Formal initiation, for consideration at a later date,
                                     of a zoning code amendment or review process, such
                                     as preliminary review.

                                     (i) Status report required by law for fee administration.

                                     (j) Cancellation of meetings or scheduling of special

                                (3) Request to refer items to any Council Standing
                                Committee, committee, board, commission or Council
                                Appointed Officer. The consent calendar includes matters
                                for which staff is merely seeking Council approval of a
                                referral to a Council standing committee or other City
                                official, advisory board or commission. This does not
                                preclude staff from making referrals to the standing
                                committees. Staff uses such referrals in order to expedite
                                the business of the full Council, since its agenda is so full.
                                Discussion of a complex issue by another body, provides an
                                opportunity for public input and extended discussion by the
                                members of the body. The full Council is then able to
                                benefit from the minutes of that discussion when the item
                                comes back to the Council for final approval. This practice
                                also allows the City/School Liaison Committee to consider
                                items of interest to both agencies without having to go
                                through the formality of a Council agenda referral.

                                           (4) Items recommended for approval if the Committee
                                           unanimously recommends placement on the consent
