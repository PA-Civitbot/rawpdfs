Council Member Espinosa asked if financial hardship was being considered in
creating the list of exemptions.

Mr. Williams stated that consideration was given to financial hardship
however not included. The discussions of the issue lead to the notion that
many financial hardships would be classified under other exemptions. There
is a lot of flexibility for the Building Official to evaluate the circumstances
and make a determination.

Mayor Klein stated that this approach seems to outlaw large houses and
using the example it seems there are not enough points available for a
20,000 square foot house.

Mr. Williams stated there is a cap of 150 points in the Table, meaning that it
would never be required to accumulate more than 150 points. One home
application is aiming for 176 points but the process has not been completed
yet.

Mayor Klein asked for the maximum number of points available.

Mr. Williams stated 250 points is the maximum.

Mayor Klein asked if Staff has done its own score of a very large house in
the hills.

Mr. Perlin stated he toured a new 4,000 to 5,000 square foot home under
construction in Barron Park and found the home will probably achieve over
200 points.

Mayor Klein asked for confirmation that a 20,000 square foot home could
also score over 200 point.

Mr. Perlin confirmed that is possible.

Mayor Klein asked for assurance that the City is not imposing problems on
the historic homes with the incentives.

Mr. Williams stated that historic buildings have the number one exemption
category specifically for that reason. Green Building shouldnâ€™t be over-
burdensome or change the historic character.

Mayor Klein asked if there are any communities that completely prohibit
basements.
