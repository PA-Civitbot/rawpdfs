Ms. Elvert said the future water demand forecast was based on the higher
growth.

Council Member Burt asked how Palo Alto would do in meeting SBx7-7
requirements if it did not have the higher growth.

Ms. Elvert said Palo Alto would need to exceed the efficiency goal and
reevaluate the compliance methodology and the water use reduction target
in the 2015 UWMP.

Council Member Burt said based on the current projected water usage how
would Palo Alto do in meeting the requirements if the population growth was
more in line with the Planning Departmentâ€™s projections.

Ms. Elvert said she did not have the exact target numbers in front of her but
could provide the information after the meeting.

Council Member Burt said he wanted to know how Palo Alto would do if it
had the population growths that were projected and what would it take if
Palo Alto were to aim for higher efficiency. He said the community was
continually told the cost per unit volume to determine if bills would increase
based on the cost per unit volume when the rate increases were no where
near that for their monthly bill. He said it was an issue of concern and
needed to be addressed.

Vice Mayor Yeh asked how the City was achieving the SBx7-7 mandated
interim goal of ten percent in conservation and water efficiency for 2015.

Utilities Marketing Services Manager, Joyce Kinnear said the City was on
target and with the UWMP programs would be able to reach the 13 percent
goals for 2020.

Vice Mayor Yeh asked if goals were based on a per capita basis.

Ms. Kinnear said that was correct.

Vice Mayor Yeh asked if Staff could run the alternative models based on
different per capita if the actual growth assumptions changed.

Ms. Fong said Staff would refresh the numbers as changes came along.

Vice Mayor Yeh asked if the Method 4 option in SBx7-7 was tailored to Palo
Alto customers.
