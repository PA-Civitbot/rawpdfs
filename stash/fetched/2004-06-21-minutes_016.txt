Ms. Grote said the new permit process approved would go into effect July
7, 2004. When a CUP was applied for, it would be a Director’s Decision.
If interested individuals requested a hearing the P&TC would hear it. A
further request for review would be put on the City Council’s Consent
Calendar, which required three Council Members votes in order to be
heard at a Public Hearing.

Council Member Freeman asked whether the maker of the motion would
accept a friendly amendment to maintain the landscape buffer.

Council Member Morton said there was already a zoning restriction in
place.

Mr. Sodergren said it was part of the existing zoning designation on the
property and any project would have to comply with it.

Council Member Freeman said the zoning could be changed with a
Director’s Hearing.

Mayor Beecham asked if Council Member Morton would consider a
friendly amendment.

Council Member Morton declined.

Council Member Freeman noted there had been a significant scale-down
of the project. She said legal comments made that evening were in the
record and provided coverage of what had been accepted.

Council Member Ojakian said in the resolution, the site was mentioned as
a 15.54-acre site and the EIR referred to it as a 15.84-acre site.

Ms. Grote said the correct size was 15.8 acres.

Council Member Ojakian asked the staff what would come back to the
Council after the EIR was certified.

Mr. Emslie said there was an Architectural Review and the Tentative
Subdivision Map. An appeal of the ARB would return to the Council. The
Tentative Subdivision Map would return to the Council regardless of an
appeal.

Council Member Ojakian asked whether Mr. Solit’s comments about
adding the mixed-use would create a different process.
