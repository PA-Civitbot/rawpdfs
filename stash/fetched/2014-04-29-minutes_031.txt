                             MINUTES

Mr. Pirnejad answered yes.

Mr. Keene understood part of the system was automated.

Mr. Pirnejad explained that Staff's proposal was to completely automate the
system.

Council Member Burt recognized that Staff was attempting to fix the process.
He wanted to have an objective and realistic baseline for building a business
registry.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION: Council Member Burt moved, seconded by Council
Member XXX to direct Staff to return with this item with a revised structure
to use permit so that the business registry can piggyback on the business
registry structure.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION FAILED DUE TO THE LACK OF A SECOND

Mayor Shepherd understood a Use Permit was charged only once; yet, fire
inspections occurred annually. She asked if the Motion was a different
program from Staff's recommendation.

Mr. Fehrenbach believed the Motion created a business registry separate
from the U&O Permit program. Businesses would be enticed to update their
information for the business registry.

Mayor Shepherd wanted a business registry that was updated yearly. She
inquired whether businesses obtained Use Permits only once.

Mr. Fehrenbach indicated businesses were required to obtain a new U&O
Certificate when they refurbished a building or had a tenant improvement. A
U&O Certificate was obtained only once. Staff proposed to continue the
elements of the U&O Certificate and to add a questionnaire which had to be
updated regularly.

Mayor Shepherd inquired whether the proposal was for businesses to
complete a questionnaire annually and to remit a fee.

Mr. Fehrenbach reported that was the Staff recommendation.

Mayor Shepherd did not find a recommendation for an annual questionnaire
and fee. She asked if Staff would propose those items in phase two.
