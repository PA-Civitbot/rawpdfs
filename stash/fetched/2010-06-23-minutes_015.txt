Council Member Scharff asked what would occur if the Stanford Shopping
Concept Plan was approved.

Mr. Williams said policies to potentially develop housing around the Stanford
Shopping Center area would be included in the Comprehensive Plan.

MOTION: Council Member Scharff moved, seconded by Council Member
Shepherd that at a later date, Staff is to develop a policy for preparation of a
Concept Plan for the Stanford Shopping Center site, to include the
exploration of housing at the site without diminishing the ability to support
retail opportunities at the site.

Council Member Holman said she would not support the Motion because the
purpose of an area plan was to limit the retail in the area.

Council Member Scharff said that was not the intent of the Motion and
clarified the housing portion would not limit the amount of retail on the site.

Council Member Holman said she understood but was uncomfortable with
the language of the Motion.

Ms. Caporgno clarified Staff was asking for the Councilâ€™s approval of the
general concept. It was not to develop the actual language that would be
approved in the Comprehensive Plan.

Mayor Burt said the language should indicate the intent would be not to
diminish retail opportunities at the site.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND THE SECONDER that the City take the lead role in
preparation of the Concept Plan in coordination with Stanford.

Mayor Burt clarified it would reduce the ambiguity of who would have lead
role.

Council Member Scharff said the City would have the lead role and not
Stanford.

Council Member Price said it was her understanding the Council was
providing the language to pursue the concept and would support the Motion.
