MOTION: Council Member Shepherd moved, seconded by Council Member
Price to Support Measure E- Foothill-De Anza Community College District
Parcel Tax and direct Staff to return on October 4, 2010 with a Resolution on
the Consent Calendar.

MOTION PASSED: 9-0

Mr. Keene suggested referring the propositions to the Policy and Services
Committee (P&S) since most required pros and cons and finalization on the
way they were written.

MOTION: Council Member Holman moved, seconded by Council Member
Yeh to refer support of Measure A-Children’s Health Initiative to Policy &
Services Committee.

Council Member Holman said it would be a while before the National Health
Care Plan would be implemented. There were challenges to cover children
with preexisting conditions and the need to support an under-served
population.

Council Member Yeh said the proposition would generate local revenues to
be used locally and help target uncertainties on health coverage for children
in California and needed the support.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to remove the referral to Policy & Services, and
direct Staff to return to Council on October 4, 2010 with a Resolution.

Council Member Klein said if there were doubts in a Measure, it should be
forwarded to Policy & Services Committee for their recommendation.

Mr. Keene said due to time constraints it would be difficult to get the issue
back on next Monday’s agenda if forwarded to the Policy & Services
Committee meeting on Thursday.
