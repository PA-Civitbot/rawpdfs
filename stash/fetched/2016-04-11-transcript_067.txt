Cowper/Webster is probably 70-80ish. Civic Center is probably 70-80ish,
and then Lot S is probably—Lot S has been definitely going up. It's probably
90.

Mayor Burt: Say we average 85 percent; 85 percent utilization of 1,200
leaves—what's that math? I think this actually ...

Council Member Berman: 180.

Mayor Burt: 180 spots. If we increase that utilization to say 90-95 percent,
then we're looking at picking up—say it was 90 spots or something like that.
If we went to this 100 percent or near 100 percent utilization with the $2
million system, then that's close to 180 spots, call it 150. 150 times—are
we using 60,000 per spot as our rough number? That's $9 million in parking
spot value that we create. That's why I say that's really critical. To me, if
we're looking at alternatives, if we spend $2 million to save $9 million,
because we're talking about building a garage Downtown. We either are
going to use that 150 spots that we've basically freed up or utilize better
toward solving our problem more rapidly or toward less investment in the
size of the new garage. That makes it, for me, a much easier decision first
on which alternative we ought to pursue. If we're looking at spending an
extra $750,000 and picking up 100 parking spaces worth $6 million, then
$750,000 is money well spent. That's pretty important for purposes of our
conversation. Then we ask ourselves if that's the savings we can derive
from this investment, what's the best way to get those dollars? I think there
are several alternatives. When you were talking about the parking permit
funds, Jessica, were you talking about the annual permits sold in the
neighborhood?

Ms. Sullivan: No, it's just for garages. The money that's—for garage
permits, the money that's used—the money that we get from selling permits
goes to maintain and operate the garages basically.

Mayor Burt: How would we get dollars from that to be able to pay for this?
Are you talking about increasing the permit amounts? Unless we've got a
surplus right now from that, which I'm not aware of.

Mr. Keene: On the paid permit funds was towards the wayfinding program,
is that what you were thinking of? That was in the $600,000 range, first of
all. I don't know if we've run what the changes would be, both what the
existing balance could be.

Mayor Burt: There may be some balance that would pay for wayfinding.
Would we have the latitude to increase those permit amounts?
