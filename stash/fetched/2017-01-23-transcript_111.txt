Council Member Fine: Mr. Mayor, do you mind if I quickly query the
audience to see if any of them have five cars?

Mayor Scharff: I don't mind.

Council Member Fine: Any of you have five cars? Anybody have four cars?

Female: My neighbor has five or six cars.

Council Member Fine: Do they park in the driveway or on the street?

Female: Both sometimes.

Council Member Fine: The reason I'm asking is five cars is quite a lot. No
judgments. If we are talking about impacts, that is an impact you'd have on
your neighbor. The unfriendly Amendment would be to change that from
five to three.

Mayor Scharff: You're seconding that?

AMENDMENT: Council Member Fine moved, seconded by Council Member
Tanaka to reduce the number of permits residents can obtain from 5 to 4.

Mayor Scharff: Do you want to speak to your second?

Council Member Tanaka: No.

Mayor Scharff: Let's vote. That fails on a 4-4.

AMENDMENT FAILED: 4-4 DuBois, Filseth, Holman, Kou no, Kniss absent

Council Member Fine: Thank you. The next one is something a number of
us have mentioned and we've heard from some of the business owners in
this community, about the difficulty in terms of getting spots in the Cal. Ave.
parking district. The unfriendly Amendment would be to direct Staff to look
at ways of streamlining the ability of businesses to purchase permits in the
garage areas.     The purpose being that we would rather have these
employees park in the garages than on residential streets.

Mayor Scharff: Does Staff know what that means in terms of actually what
they'd do?

Council Member Fine: It may be a separate direction.
