Council Member Burt inquired whether the Council should consider the
recommendations individually or as a group.

Vice Mayor Kniss preferred to consider them individually.

MOTION: Council Member Burt moved, seconded by Vice Mayor Kniss to
direct Staff to initiate designating 300 Homer Street, known as the Roth
Building, to be eligible as a “Sender Site” in the Transfer of Development
Rights (TDR) program.

Council Member Burt recalled Mr. Green's statement that in May 2012 the
City designated the Roth Building as a "Sender Site."

Ms. Stump noted according to Mr. Green the document being referred was a
draft and had not been executed. Designating the property as a "Sender
Site" was before the Council. If the Council adopted the recommendation,
the next step would be to perform an appraisal and place an authorization to
initiate the sale on the Council's Consent Calendar.

Mr. Ghaemmaghami clarified that Staff would return to the Council for
approval of a Resolution designating the location as a "Sender Site" prior to
performing an appraisal.

Council Member Burt inquired whether that could occur expeditiously.

Mr. Ghaemmaghami would need to place the Resolution on the Council's
Agenda.

Vice Mayor Kniss believed the location was clearly a "Sender Site" in terms
of the Ordinance. She asked if the City could negotiate a minimum amount
for the TDRs.

Mr. Ghaemmaghami reported Staff would need to perform some market
research to set a minimum in the process of the RFP.

Vice Mayor Kniss asked if the TDRs would go out to bid.

Mr. Ghaemmaghami advised that the RFP would set the minimum price that
Staff believed was appropriate.

Vice Mayor Kniss inquired whether the bid process would be open to many
people.

Mr. Ghaemmaghami indicated the TDR sale had to be open bidding.
