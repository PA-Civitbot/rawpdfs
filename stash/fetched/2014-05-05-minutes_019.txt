                            MINUTES

Council Member Burt did not believe that would be an appropriate action as
the P&TC had made a recommendation.

Council Member Price asked if the Council would discuss the Concept Plan as
part of the Comprehensive Plan discussion scheduled for early August 2014.

Ms. Gitelman reported the Council would discuss densities around the
California Avenue area as part of the alternatives analysis.

Council Member Price asked if the Concept Plan would be a part of that
discussion.

Mr. Keene advised that it could be a part of the discussion.        He was
comfortable with presenting the item on the Consent Calendar.

MOTION PASSED: 8-1 Price no

Council Member Klein wanted to know how Staff would handle Council
comments.

Mr. Keene indicated Staff would group comments under headings and
convert them into questions. The Council could provide ongoing written
comments. The public would be interested in knowing the types of issues
raised by the Council.   Staff suggested video interviews with Council
Members so they could personalize concerns and questions about the
Comprehensive Plan and update process.

Council Member Klein suggested the draft document indicate it had not been
reviewed or approved by the Council.

SPECIAL ORDERS OF THE DAY

2.    Proclamation Expressing Appreciation to the Electric Vehicle (EV) Task
      Force for Outstanding Public Service.

Council Member Burt read the Proclamation into the record.

Peter Pirnejad, Development Services Director, thanked the Council for the
Proclamation. Mobile sources accounted for more than half of emissions that
contributed to ozone and particulate matter and nearly 40 percent of
greenhouse gas emissions in California.
