emissions. The plan was implemented through achieving aggressive targets
in energy efficiency; continuing to develop local generation of solar power;
continuing to procure long-term renewable resources; and using
hydroelectric power sources and renewable energy certificates.           Staff
discussed several options with the Utilities Advisory Commission (UAC) and
the Finance Committee. The PaloAltoGreen gas program would neutralize
greenhouse gas emissions associated with natural gas usage. Staff intended
to return to the Council with details of a program which would be launched
in July 2014. Staff would also develop a local solar strategy plan for Council
consideration.

Council Member Burt reported the Finance Committee was hesitant to retire
a successful program. The PaloAltoGreen Program was now offered to all
ratepayers at essentially no additional cost. The recommendation provided
good alternatives for next phases.

MOTION: Council Member Burt moved, seconded by Council Member
Schmid to:        1) approve the attached Resolution suspending the
PaloAltoGreen Full Needs Program for all electric customers and reducing
rates for PaloAltoGreen’s Commercial Customer Block Program to $2 per
1,000 kWh block, or 0.2 cents per kilowatt-hour (cent/kWh), 2) direct Staff
to develop a PaloAltoGreen Gas Program to provide an opportunity for
participants to reduce or eliminate greenhouse gas emissions related to their
natural gas usage, to be implemented by July 2014, and 3) direct Staff to
return with a recommendation on how to allocate accumulated revenues, if
any, associated with the PaloAltoGreen program by June 2014.

Council Member Schmid believed this was a great triumph for the City with
three times the number of participants as other cities and with full carbon
neutrality.  A gas program was the logical next step.       Approximately
$800,000 was generated in surplus funds.

MOTION PASSED: 7-0 Berman, Kniss absent

18.   Approval of City Positions for the 2013 League of California Cities
      Resolutions.

Sheila Tucker, Assistant to the City Manager, noted the primary voting
delegate was Council Member Holman and the alternate was Council Member
Price. Staff recommended support of both Resolutions.

MOTION: Council Member Holman moved, seconded by Council Member
Price to approve Staff recommendation that the Council authorize the City’s
voting delegate to vote on the two (2) Resolutions to be considered at the
                                                                         Page 14 of 17
