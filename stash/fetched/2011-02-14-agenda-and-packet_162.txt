     DISCUSSION:
     The proposed project includes improvements within the public right of way (sidewalk and road) of a
     fully developed commercial area and is not anticipated to create any new hydrology and water quality
     impacts.

     All development is required to comply with building codes that address flood safety issues.
     Development projects are required to implement Best Management Practices (BMPs) for construction
     activities as specified by the California Storm Water Best Management Practices Handbook (CASQA,
     2003) and/or the Manual of Standards for Erosion and Sediment Control Measures (ABAG, 1995).
     The BMPs include measures guiding the management and operation of construction sites to control
     and minimize the potential contribution of pollutants to storm runoff from these areas. These measures
     address procedures for controlling erosion and sedimentation and managing all aspects of the
     construction process to ensure control of potential water pollution sources. All development projects
     must comply with all City, State and Federal standards pertaining to storm water run-off and water
     quality.

     Mitigation Measures: None Required
