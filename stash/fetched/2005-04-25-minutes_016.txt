City Attorney Gary Baum said there were legal constraints the Council had in
reviewing the project. From the March 7, 2005, Metro PCS versus San
Francisco case, the court outlined what could be considered as typical land
use items.

Council Member Morton stated he would not participate in the item due to a
conflict of interest because of investment interest in SBC.

Mr. Baum asked whether T-Mobile was owned by SBC.

Ms. French said the letter indicated “doing business as T-Mobile”.

Council Member Morton said he was waiting for the City Attorney’s answer
as to whether he needed to excuse himself from the issue.

Mr. Baum said the letter indicated that future correspondence should be sent
to Pacific Bell Wireless, doing business as T-Mobile, which could provide a
conflict.

Council Member Morton said he would excuse himself.

Mr. Baum confirmed. He stated that T-Mobile could better explain who the
applicant was.

Mayor Burch asked whether five votes were needed to approve the item
because it was quasi-judicial.

Mr. Baum said it could be a simple majority of a vote of three.

Planning and Transportation Commissioner Phyllis Cassel said the site
chosen was believed to be the best site.

Mayor Burch declared the Public Hearing open at 9:15 p.m.

Winter Dellenbach, Barron Park, said it would be advantageous to have an
updated policy, which took legalities and technology into consideration prior
to placement of another tower.

Bill Stephens, T-Mobile Applicant, 1855 Gateway Boulevard, Concord, CA,
said T-Mobile did not have a corporate relationship with SBC. The project
would be finalized after another landscaping review. The site offered the
most opportunities for compliance with the City’s guidelines, ordinance, and
policy.
