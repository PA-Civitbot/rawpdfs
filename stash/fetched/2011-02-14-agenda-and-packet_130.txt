The implementation of employee and future retiree medical premium contributions by
miscellaneous employees (excludes sworn safety employees in police and fire departments)
results in 3 months of medical premium savings this fiscal year, which is estimated to be
$95,730. This amount is a reduction for FY 2011 due to the delay of the 90/10 implementation
to allow the employee healthcare committee to develop alternatives. The employee
contributions toward medical premiums are expected to save the City $370,000 on an annual
basis according to the 2011 healthcare rates.

The City will contribute to its retiree insurance trust an amount not less than the amount of
premiums paid by active employees in the miscellaneous employee groups.

Policy Implications
This resolution implements provisions previously approved in the 2010-11 SEIU MOA and the
2009-10 Compensation Plan for Management and Professional Personnel. It also supports the
Finance Committee’s recommendation for staff to bring alternatives forward on how to slow
the increase of employee benefits and lessen the impact on infrastructure and other City
priorities. Staff also plans to continue pursuing health care benefit changes in negotiations with
other employee units.
