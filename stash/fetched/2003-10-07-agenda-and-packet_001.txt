PUBLIC HEARING

1.      (CMR:459:03)        Public Hearing: The City Council will consider at a
        public scoping meeting the potential impacts to be addressed in the
        Environmental Impact Report for the Development Agreement
        between the City of Palo Alto and Stanford University.              The
        Development Agreement would allow an athletic fields complex (3
        fields with parking) on the Mayfield site located at the northwest
        corner of El Camino Real and Page Mill Road. In return, Stanford
        would receive vesting for 100,000 square feet of new development in
        the South Research Park. To offset the loss of potential housing on
        the Mayfield site, Stanford would build a minimum of 250 housing
        units on six sites in the City (on California Avenue and El Camino Real)
        currently occupied with 312,000 square feet of R&D/office
        development. Stanford would receive vested rights to replace 200,000
        of that square footage in the South Research Park and to construct the
        250 housing units.
COUNCIL MAKES EVERY EFFORT TO COMPLETE ALL AGENDA ITEMS BY 11:30 P.M. PRIOR TO TAKING A BREAK AT
