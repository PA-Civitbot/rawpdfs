would be updated to reflect the conservation efforts, change the baseline,
and to have the environmental findings show the Cityâ€™s commitment being
compliant with the State law.

Mr. Emslie said once the City was into the project they would have broader
latitude in setting conservation standards and goals for Stanford and would
take into account directions for conservation in the final recommendations.

Ms. Silver clarified Staff was working on the SB7 analysis and would need to
return to the UAC and go through the full public process. The latest and
greatest information would be incorporated in releasing the EIR.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION: Council Member Schmid moved, seconded by
Council Member XXXX to return this Agenda Item to Staff to return at the
next Council meeting with further clarification.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION FAILED DUE TO THE LACK OF A SECOND

Council Member Price asked if the item were approved and incorporated into
the EIR, would the data be updated to reflect current data relevant to State
law and other items to provide additional information specific to the draft
EIR.

Ms. Silver said the draft EIR was expected on April 26, 2010 and most likely
would not contain conclusions on SB7 but would be available for the final
EIR.

Mr. Keene asked if the schedule would give the Council the opportunity to
incorporate conditions, concerns, restrictions either in the Conditions of
Approval or in the Development Agreement.

Ms. Silver confirmed it would.
