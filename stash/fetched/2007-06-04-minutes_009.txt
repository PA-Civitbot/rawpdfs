Chief of Police Lynne Johnson stated there were complaints regarding
panhandling in the area, which were covered by the current Ordinance. The
amendment would not prohibit panhandling, but would prohibit people who
sit and lie on public sidewalks and create safety issues. She stated only
three citations had been given out since the first Ordinance was adopted.
The Ordinance did require a warning prior to the citation being issued.

Council Member Drekmeier asked if a person came back would that then be
the warning or a citation given and whether it would be in the course of a
day or a week.

Ms. Johnson replied a citation would be given and it would be over the
course of a week. Most people just move outside of the area covered by the
Ordinance.

Council Member Morton asked about the ratio of customers to business
owners making the complaints.

Ms. Johnson stated she was unsure of the ratio.

City Attorney Gary Baum stated the Ordinance was not about any one
individual, but an expansion of the existing Ordinance to include a number of
locations.

Council Member Kleinberg asked whether there was a rule regarding
standing in front of a commercial establishment panhandling or asking
people to sign a petition.

Ms. Johnson stated there was no prohibition.

Council Member Kleinberg asked what the exemption was regarding tables
and chairs being placed outside of restaurants and coffee shops.

Ms. Johnson replied it would be considered exempt as long as the restaurant
had the correct sidewalk encroachment permit.

Council Member Cordell asked whether this Ordinance was legal because it
dealt with hazards associated with people sitting or lying on the sidewalks.

Mr. Baum replied the public sidewalks were to be used by the public for
transportation. If there was an individual sitting or lying on that sidewalk, it
could no longer be used by others.
