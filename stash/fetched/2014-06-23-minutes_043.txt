Council Member Scharff thought Council giving direction for the best and
safest pathway solutions for bicyclists and pedestrians was good.

Council Member Burt agreed.

Council Member Scharff remarked that the Conditions of Approval provided
for crosswalks at certain intersections and wanted to know if there would be
a situation where they would not want crosswalks.

Ms. Gitelman said crosswalks were imposed in all directions and did not want
to see those conditions deleted.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to engage the neighborhood and Safe Routes to
School Committee for best, safe pathways heading in and out of the project.

Council Member Schmid thought the current Motion did a good job, having
housing, instead of office connecting to College Terrace was good. The
sensitivity to traffic made a lot of sense. He suggested an Amendment to
receive an Informational Report from Fire Chief on ingress and egress for fire
apparatuses and ambulances for driveway A and B within 60 days

Council Member Scharff was confused about what would be in the Report.

Council Member Schmid wanted to know what kind of timing was needed to
make an effective turnaround at a dead end street.

Mr. Nickel said Staff could look into it and come back with a report; it was
probably going to be about a year after the neighborhood is up and
functioning. He wondered what would be done with the report and what
policy it drove.

Council Member Schmid remarked that the report was only effective if they
could get it soon, for the value of a turnaround on those driveways.

Mr. Nickel said he could examine a similar neighborhood with a similar lay
out, similar size, and with rolled curbs to see if he can get some meaningful
data.

Council Member Schmid thought that would be helpful.
