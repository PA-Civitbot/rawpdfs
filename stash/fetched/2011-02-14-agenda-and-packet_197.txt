California Avenue Lane Reduction – Traffic Analysis Report


Observed Existing Traffic Conditions
Traffic conditions in the field were observed in order to identify existing operational
deficiencies and to confirm the accuracy of calculated levels of service. The purpose of this




                                                                                                       Attachment: Attachment B: Hexagon - Cal Av TIA Report (No Appendices) (1320 : California Avenue Neg Dec and CIP)
effort was (1) to identify any existing traffic problems that may not be directly related to
intersection level of service, and (2) to identify any locations where the level of service
calculation does not accurately reflect level of service in the field. Overall, the study
intersections operate well during the weekday AM, midday, and PM peak hours. Vehicles
were able to clear the signal on each cycle. Speeds on California Avenue are slow because of
cars hunting for parking spaces and because of numerous pedestrians crossing the street,
both in the crosswalks and between crosswalks. Also, there are many bicycles using
California Avenue to access the Caltrain station.
