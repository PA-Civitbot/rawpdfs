MOTION: Mayor Scharff moved, seconded by Council Member Holman to
direct Staff to: 1) proceed to the Policy & Services Committee for policy
discussion and recommendation to the full Council to expand the City’s
outdoor smoking ban in the Downtown and California Avenue Business
Districts; 2) conduct outreach to downtown and California Avenue residents,
businesses and property owners for input on expanding the City’s current
ban on outdoor smoking in certain areas, including California Ave and
University Ave and possibly other streets in the downtown cores; and 3)
benchmark other jurisdictions’ outdoor smoking ban ordinances in downtown
cores.

Council Member Holman noted the health concerns of smoking and second-
hand smoke.

Council Member Price concurred with previous comments.

Council Member Schmid agreed that smoking was unhealthy; however, he
knew of no medical study that indicated walking down a street with someone
smoking led to lung cancer or respiratory disease. He suggested the Policy
and Services Committee review literature to determine whether smoking on
a sidewalk impacted health. Otherwise the role of local government was
toleration and acceptance of things the community did not necessarily like.

Council Member Burt wanted to be cautious regarding legislating against
things that annoyed him. A health risk was different from a personal
preference.

MOTION PASSED: 8-1 Schmid no

ADJOURNMENT: The meeting was adjourned at 10:52 P.M.
