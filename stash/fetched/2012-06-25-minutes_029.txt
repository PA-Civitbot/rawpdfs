                              MINUTES
Mr. Tanczos stated the information was close to correct, but the next step
would be testing to determine realistic data.

Vice Mayor   Scharff   assumed   increased   tower   height   provided    more
coverage.

Mr. Tanczos answered yes.

Vice Mayor Scharff asked why tower height was not increased to eliminate
areas of no coverage.

Mr. Tanczos explained the information was based on the shortest tower that
would provide ample coverage throughout the community; however, this
was not the only design possible.

Vice Mayor Scharff inquired if the user experience would be the same in an
area of moderate signal as opposed to an area of strong signal.

Mr. Tanczos stated proximity to a cell site determined data speed. A
location close to a cell site would have increased data speed. Small cells
would be located at the fringe of coverage to boost data speed. Another
option was to make towers extendable to higher heights.

Vice Mayor Scharff repeated the question, whether there was data to
support the userâ€™s cellular experience in an area that was moderate or
strong.

Mr. Tanczos answered no. Any location in the dark blue and the inner light
blue areas on the map would provide a very good user experience. Beyond
that, the user experience would be marginal. He did not have specific
numbers.

Vice Mayor Scharff inquired about the method for charging the Public Safety
Department for use of towers.

Mr. Tanczos reported a number of different business arrangements were
possible. The RFQ could specify that space would be allocated to Public
Safety uses at no additional charge.

Vice Mayor Scharff inquired about the amount of space available on a tower.

Mr. Tanczos indicated the amount of space depended on a carrier's needs,
the spectrum frequency, and what was covered. The 700-800 megahertz
frequencies transmitted better and farther than the 1.9 Gigahertz
