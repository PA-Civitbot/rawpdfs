Council Member Morton referred to Exhibit 14 and noted that compared with
Mountain View, Palo Alto provides more than three times as many hours and
questioned if the additional Librarians enabled Palo Alto to provide a higher
quality service.

Ms. Erickson stated in Palo Alto there were more Librarians and hours but
less square feet, which were spread out over multiple facilities. If the
community needed more hours this would be reassessed to reassign staff to
circulation and cross training.

Council Member Morton stated the number of visits to the libraries compared
to neighboring communities was very high.

Ms. Erickson stated he was correct.

Council Member Morton stated when that factor was put into the number of
Librarians, it gives a different statistic but it was not clear what was being
measured.

Ms. Erickson stated we are trying to stretch dollars and resources as far as
possible while enhancing the quality of service.

Council Member Morton added Palo Alto has concentrated on the quality of
service and now must concentrate on the physical part.

Vice Mayor Klein asked if it was possible to build the new facilities without an
increase in staff.

Ms. Erickson stated the recommendation was to use existing staff as
efficiently as possible and incorporate more hours with current staff.

Ms. Jennings said if a larger Mitchell Park Library reopened, it would need to
have more hours. The consultant’s report recommended between one and a
half to three positions be added to Mitchell Park Library’s new design.

Council Member Beecham stated this audit was to ensure our residents that
our libraries were being operated optimally.

MOTION: Council Member Morton moved, seconded by Barton, to accept
the Audit of Library Operations.

MOTION PASSED         8-0 Kishimoto absent.
