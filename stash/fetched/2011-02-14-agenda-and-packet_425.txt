(D.C. Cir. 2007), EPA must follow the plain language of the statute. In the case of SSIs, the plain language of
the statute directs EPA to regulate POTWs (including SSIs) under § 112. The court in the NRDC case did not




                                                                                                                                              Attachment: PA Comments EPA HQ-OAR-2009-0559_Final (1297 : EPA Proposed Rule on Sewage Sludge Incinerators)
address § 112(e)(5), nor did it specifically address the regulation of POTWs or SSIs, so the decision in that case
has no bearing on how SSIs are to be regulated under the CAA. Likewise, nothing in § 129 suggests that SSIs
are not to be treated as part of the POTW to be regulated under § 112, and it is axiomatic that the specific
direction of Congress contained in § 112(e)(5) is controlling over the general provisions of § 129 dealing with
solid waste incineration. “However inclusive may be the general language of a statute, it will not be held to
apply to a matter specifically dealt with in another part of the same enactment.” Fourco Glass Co. v. Transmirra
Products Corp., 353 U.S. 222, 228 (1957).

        The bottom line is that CAA § 112(e)(5) unambiguously directs EPA to set emission standards for HAPs
from SSIs under § 112(d), and this section does not contain language permitting EPA discretion to regulate
SSIs under § 129. While Congress under § 112(d)(1) allows EPA to promulgate differing standards for major
and area sources at POTWs and for differing categories of sources at POTWs, the Agency emphatically does not
have the authority to set standards under § 129 for POTWs or parts of POTWs, including SSIs. Indeed, EPA has
already adopted regulations based on this conclusion. While EPA can change its mind on policy issues if the
Agency develops a reasoned analysis to support the change, See Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass'n. v. State Farm Mutual, 463
U.S. 29 (1983), it cannot act contrary to a statutory directive that compels a singular outcome, as the CAA does
here. The D.C. Circuit decision in NRDC does not alter these fundamental principles of statutory construction
and, indeed, is based on an admonition to EPA to apply the CAA as written. Any action seeking to regulate SSIs
under CAA § 129 is contrary to the plain meaning of §§ 112 and 129.

         C.       EPA Has No Authority to Regulate Sewage Sludge Incinerators Under § 129

                  1.       Sewage Sludge is Not a Solid Waste 11

         The CAA defines solid waste by referencing the definition of solid waste under RCRA: “The term ‘solid
waste’ . . . shall have the meaning established by the Administrator pursuant to [RCRA].” CAA § 129(g)(6).
RCRA defines “solid waste” as:

                  any garbage, refuse, sludge from a waste treatment plant, water supply treatment
                  plant, or air pollution control facility and other discarded material, including
                  solid, liquid, semisolid, or contained gaseous material resulting from industrial,
                  commercial, mining, and agricultural operations, and from community activities,
                  but does not include solid or dissolved material in domestic sewage . . . .

42 U.S.C. § 6903(27) (emphasis added). This expressly excludes the sewage sludge in domestic sewage from the
definition of “solid waste” in what is commonly referred to as the “Domestic Sewage Exclusion” (“DSE”).

       This concept of a broad POTW exemption was established by Congress as early as 1965 in the Solid
Waste Disposal Act.12 There was an early recognition that a comprehensive solid waste program, designed
