Council Member Burt stated he would introduce a Motion to interview the
one candidate who was not interviewed previously.

Council Member Holman withdrew her Substitute Motion in favor of Mayor
Yehâ€™s comments.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION WITHDRAWN

SUBSTITUTE MOTION: Council Member Burt moved, seconded by Council
Member Espinosa to interview Henry Wong, and then return to the full
Council for a vote without reopening recruitment.

Council Member Espinosa stated Mr. Wong's application was strong, and
having all Council Members present for a vote could lead to a decision.

Council Member Klein supported the original Motion. This would not be a
one-year term, because the Council historically reappointed that person to a
full term.

Vice Mayor Scharff would vote for the Substitute Motion.     If it failed, he
would then vote for the original Motion.

Council Member Holman had wanted Mayor Yeh to lobby further for another
round of voting. She would vote against the Substitute Motion.

Mayor Yeh stated he would vote for the Substitute Motion to avoid the
extended process of reopening the recruitment.
