MOTION: Council Member Morton moved, seconded by Mossar, to
approve the staff recommendation to approve the resolution
establishing a Storm Drain Oversight Committee and direct staff to
proceed with the solicitation of potential Committee members.

Council Member Morton said he looked forward to new and improved
storm drains, and agreed an oversight committee was needed to
implement the measure.

Council Member Freeman requested the motion incorporate having
alternating terms for the committee members.

Council Member Morton believed staff could make that decision
without Council direction.

Assistant City Manager Emily Harrison said staff would need Council’s
direction to incorporate staggering terms for the committee members.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF
THE MAKER AND SECONDED that there is to be alternating terms
for the committee members.

Council Member Freeman referred to Section 3(a) in Attachment A of
the staff report (CMR:410:05), and asked to remove the specific date
of “April 30th each year” to “at least one week prior to submitting it for
budget purposes.”

Mr. Roberts said staff could connect the date with the Finance
Committee action.

Council Member Mossar believed the budget cycle did not have any
meaning. The words “prior to the budget cycle” could be in November
or September.

Council Member Morton said he would not accept the modified
language. He was comfortable with staff’s wording of “prior to April
30th.”

Mr. Roberts said staff believed the addition of a specific date would
give more motivation and certainty to the process.

Council Member Mossar said the advantage of having a date made it
clear the Finance Committee would receive the information in a timely
manner.

Council Member Freeman said if the budget cycle changed in the
future the ordinance would need to be changed with a specific date.
