Council Member Questions, Comments and Announcements

Mayor Burt: Council Member Comments. Council Member Holman.

Council Member Holman: Three comments quickly. I think three of us went
to the Cooley Landing Ribbon Cutting this Saturday. If anybody hasn't been
out there, it's really a fabulous facility and gorgeous setting. It was a great
turnout and had a lot of high-level elected support there. Sunday the
Magical Bridge Playground celebrated its first anniversary. There also was
an announcement made today that they have formed now the Magical
Bridge Foundation. I encourage everybody to go to their website and check
that out and what their plans are. Sunday also at the Mitchell Park
Community Center, Blossom Birth held a family event. Something like 600
families turned out. It was quite an amazing, amazing turnout. Great
events this last weekend.

Mayor Burt: Council Member DuBois.

Council Member DuBois: This is more of a question. I wondered if we could
get an update on the Polling Committee that we appointed. Maybe not
tonight but soon.

Mayor Burt: The next thing is the polling results come back.         That's the
Agenda Item we talked about.

Council Member DuBois: That'll come back on the ...

Mayor Burt: To the Council.

Adjournment: The meeting was adjourned at 11:54 P.M.
