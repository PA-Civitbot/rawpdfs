Mayor Burt: I think we were okay with going about it either way, but the
language that was in here wasn't clear. Either taking this number or other
language that would be clear on the intent may accomplish the same thing.

Mr. Mello: At the last discussion we had about ratcheting down the number
of permits back in February, if you remember we proposed 200 per year
consistently in order to give the employees time to shift modes and carpool
and find other means. That's the limited amount of discussion we've had to
date with you about a reduction. That was our intent, to come back in
January with a more firm proposal on how the reduction would be tied to our
TMA efforts and other efforts.

Mayor Burt: Josh, with that concept of the 200 reduction, is that 200 per
year reduction from the theoretical 2,000 or the actual 1,465?

Mr. Mello: I think what we discussed in February was 2,000. Again, that
was just kind of a high level proposal based on what we calculated the mode
switch could potentially be.

Mayor Burt: I think that goes out the window, given that we're not selling
anywhere near 2,000. We have to figure out if 1,465 is the number that
we're selling now, how many should be sold in 2017.

Council Member DuBois: (inaudible)

Mayor Burt: No, we haven't.

Council Member DuBois: We haven't sold all of those.

Mr. Atkinson: No, we've sold about 1,350. The issue of a proposal for a
number of permits to reduce to is something that we internally have not
begun to discuss. That's something that we are intending to bring back in
January after we've had time to evaluate permit sales and allocation.

Mr. Keene: Can I just say ...

Mayor Burt: Yeah.

Mr. Keene: Clearly there's new direction. The concept of a theoretical 2,000
reduced by 200 in 2017, the Council's saying the evidence already sort of
belies whether or not that's the right pacing. It's got to somewhere down.

Mayor Burt: I would offer also that the 200 per year was a 10 percent.
That's 10 percent of 2,000, but we're not selling 2,000. If we say for round
numbers we have a 2016 number of 1,500 and we ratchet that down to
1,350 in 2017, that's the kind of progress that may be substantive.
