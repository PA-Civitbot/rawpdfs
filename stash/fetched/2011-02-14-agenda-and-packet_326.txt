VI.   Ad Hoc Committees

      A. Policy. The Council may use Ad Hoc Committees on a limited basis where
      necessary to study City business in greater depth than what is possible in the time
      allotted for Council and Standing Committee meetings.

             1. Purpose. These rules are intended to clarify the distinctions between
             Standing and Ad Hoc Committees, and to set up guidelines for creation of
             Ad Hoc Committees.

      B. General Requirements. Council Ad Hoc Committees shall be subject to the
      following procedural rules.




                                                                                                          Attachment: 2.15.11 (1422 : Policy and Services Agenda 2/15/2011)
             1. Definition of Ad Hoc Committee. An Ad Hoc Committee is an advisory
             committee composed solely of less than a quorum of members of the
             Council. The work of an Ad Hoc Committee is limited to a single finite
             purpose. By contrast, a Standing Committee has continuing subject matter
             jurisdiction extending for a lengthy time period and/or a meeting schedule
             fixed by charter, ordinance, resolution, or formal action of the Council.

             2. Brown Act. Ad Hoc Committees do not constitute legislative bodies and
             are not subject to the requirements of the Brown Act.

             3. Appointment. The Mayor or the City Council may appoint four or less
             members of the Council to serve on an Ad Hoc Committee. In contrast, only
             the Council and not the Mayor alone can create a Standing Committee. The
             Mayor will publicly announce any Ad Hoc Committee created by him or
             her, its membership and stated purpose and posted on the City Council
             website. The City Manager shall prepare a report to Council about the
             anticipated time commitment required for staff to assist the Ad Hoc
             Committee.

             4. Duration. Ad Hoc Committees are created for a finite period of time. If
             an Ad Hoc Committee does not complete its task by the end of the calendar
             year, it shall not continue unless reappointed by the new Mayor in the
             following year.

             5. Members. Ad Hoc Committees shall consist of less than a quorum of
             Council members only, and shall not include any other persons such as
             members of other legislative bodies.

             6. Reporting. Ad Hoc Committees shall report their recommendations to
             the Council no less than once per quarter in writing or orally. Any Council
