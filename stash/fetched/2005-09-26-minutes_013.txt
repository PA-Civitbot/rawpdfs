     Districts) of Chapter 18.12 [R-1 Single-Family Residence District
     Regulations]”

Council Member Kishimoto said the allowable square footage for the main
house should be kept separate from the allowable covered parking footage.
Allowing greater square footage for smaller lots should be done separately.

Council Member Beecham said he continued to support the need for garages.
He supported the recommendation but not changing the FAR for smaller lots.

Council Member Mossar supported the motion.

Council Member Ojakian asked whether an HIE could be obtained when
using a portion of carport footage.

Mr. Emslie said yes.

Council Member Ojakian asked if there was an area in town that was more
vulnerable to carports.

Mr. Emslie said neighborhoods with Eichler homes are more vulnerable to
carports.

Mr. Lippert clarified HIE’s applied only to modified existing structures and
not to new properties.

Council Member Ojakian supported the motion.

Council Member Freeman viewed the issue as obtaining more space. One
alternative was to get more structure of an HIE or by modifying the HIE to
include added space. Another alternative was using the carport to change a
structure on the property but could cause an issue. She supported the
motion.

Council Member Cordell concurred with Ms. Brown’s comments. She did not
support the motion.

MOTION PASSED 7-1, Cordell no, Kleinberg absent.
