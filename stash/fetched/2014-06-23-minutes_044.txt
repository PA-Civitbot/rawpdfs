Council Member Scharff added that there was no Motion needed for this
direction.

Council Member Schmid answered yes, and requested a timely Report.

Mr. Nickel was able to deliver the report within 60 days.

Council Member Holman thought safety was important and the information
given by Bill Ross was convincing. She agreed that there was congestion on
Columbia Street and suggested a bike lane be added, one that connects to
Bowdoin Street.

Ms. Gitelman assumed that requesting collaboration with the neighborhood
and the Safe Routes to School Committee would be an outgrowth of what
was called for in the Amendment and she wanted to know if that was
something that could be addressed.

Council Member Holman wanted to know if that was something the Maker
and Seconder were interested in.

Council Member Scharff thought that should be addressed through that
process.

Council Member Holman remarked that this could help reduce conflicts.

Ms. Gitelman noted that there were sidewalks on both sides of Bowdoin
Street.

Council Member Holman was interested in getting traffic off Columbia Street
and suggested an exit on Page Mill Road from the back of the multi-family
residence.

Ms. Gitelman remarked that there was an exit provided during the
construction period but Staff felt that because it was not included in the
original agreement, they could not impose a permanent access egress on the
project.

Council Member Holman requested continued access to help alleviate
congestion on Columbia Street.
