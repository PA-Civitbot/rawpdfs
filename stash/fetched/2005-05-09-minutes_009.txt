6.   From Policy and Services Committee: Recommendation Not to
     Approve Criteria and Process for Recognizing Individuals on a Wall
     of Honor Display (New Policy) (March 15, 2005)

Council Member Freeman introduced the item and said a majority of the
Policy and Services Committee (P&S) felt the new policy was valuable,
but there were other ways the community could recognize their
members.      The P&S Committee members expressed concern that
honoring only a selected few individuals would be too great of a risk.
The P&S Committee decided not to recommend that Council adopt the
policy for recognition of individuals on a wall of honor display.

MOTION: Vice Mayor Kleinberg moved, seconded by Beecham, that the
Policy and Services Committee recommends to the City Council not to
adopt a policy for the recognition of individuals on a “Wall of Honor”
display.

MOTION PASSED 8-1, Freeman no.

Vice Mayor Kleinberg acknowledged Open Space and Sciences Division
Manager Greg Betts and the staff for their work and research in trying to
establish the policy.
