Council Member Kishimoto said she accepted the suggestion and to use the
EIR as a feasible study.

Mayor Beecham asked if her amendment was to include “reasonable
alternative sites outside the Baylands.”

Council Member Mossar said Council needed to be realistic and understand
there were compromises to be made and should not indicate to the public
that there were funds available to buy land.

Council Member Ojakian asked if staff had comments regarding the BVA
report.

Mr. Roberts said the BVA report was a study that evaluated the acreage. It
proposed leaving the hills intact and not changing the major contours of the
landfill, which would not allow composting and bin storage. In developing
the 19-acre proposal, staff chose to advocate the full spectrum of solid-
waste program needs and the reduced alternatives.

Council Member Ojakian said alternatives resulted from EIR projects but the
proposal was different.

Mr. Emslie said it was different because the EIR preceded a policy decision
on the project.

Council Member Ojakian supported a RFP but had concerns about having a
50- to 75-foot building in the Baylands. He was in agreement of looking at
other options and alternatives.

Council Member Kleinberg supported the amendment and was in agreement
of looking at all options and alternatives. She asked whether the amendment
envisioned separating portions of processing sites.

Mr. Roberts said that was a possibility but some of the facilities would need
to be co-located due to operational reasons.

Council Member Kleinberg said the City had small and useful pieces of
properties.

Council Member Morton said he needed a better definition of what
“reasonable alternatives” meant.

Mr. Baum said a better word would be “feasible” as defined by the California
Environment Quality Act (CEQA).
