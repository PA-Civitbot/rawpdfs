Mayor Burt: From a process standpoint, we as Council Members outside of
meetings can have input solicited, and then the Staff takes that input and
makes their own professional judgment as to whether to include it not. If
you, say, didn't include something, we as a Council as a whole can come

Mayor Burt: Pardon me?

Council Member Holman: I was just trying to set the stage to address kind
of what you and Vice Mayor Scharff are coming to. Thank you. Council
Member DuBois was on the phone and I met with Staff and Marty Bernstein,
who's the Chair of the HRB. The intention was that our comments would
come back as considerations. I think it's probably just an oversight here.
These should be Holman and DuBois proposed revised text, not Staff's
revised text.

Mayor Burt: It's not just what's written. It's what has been described to us
orally as how Staff responded.

Council Member Holman:       What I heard was how Staff responded to a
variety of input from ...
