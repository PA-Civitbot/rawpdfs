Council Member Scharff stated given the ballot initiative and election
timeframe he felt there was an urgency to the matter.

Council Member Yeh clarified, the purpose of referring the Colleagues Memo
to P&S was for a policy discussion; the Council Procedures indicated where
Staff resources were needed to be determined the determination needed to
return to Council within two meetings. P&S would not have had time to
review the Colleagues Memo by that time. He suggested Staff return to
Council on March 22, 2010 with a Staff resource assessment.

Council Member Klein stated the time was driven by the political electoral
calendar; he was uncertain whether he wanted to place the item on the
2011 ballot, but wished to have the option.
