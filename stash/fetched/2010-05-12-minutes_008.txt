Ms. Caporgno stated if there were an overlay zone with options of the
underlying land use designation to be used and the project were in the
overlay then it would be necessary to implement the overlay.

zoning.

Ms. Caporgno clarified if the site was placed in the housing inventory; there
was an implied commitment that this site was going to be developed in a
certain manner.

MOTION: Council Member Schmid moved, seconded by Council Member
Shepherd to direct Staff and the Planning & Transportation Commission that
the criteria for sites should provide such things as access to services,
accessibility to neighbors, compatibility to neighborhood, close to jobs and
schools, accessible to transit.

Council Member Schmid stated with the creation of a list of criteria we would
be able to check-off the developments that had the most likelihood of being
built.

Mayor Burt asked whether all of the criteria mentioned would be required or
the list would be the pallet.

Council Member Schmid stated the list of criteria would be a pallet to choose
from.

Council Member Shepherd stated there needed to be a nexus between the
services and the developments. Specific criteria of what types of services
would be available was imperative.

Council Member Price asked whether the potential for mixed-use was still a
part of the discussion.

development. The discussion of mixed-use was a part of a discussion
however not specific to the vote.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to add the wording to the Motion: the potential
for mixed use development be a criteria for identifying sites.
