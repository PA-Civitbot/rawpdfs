Mr. Keene indicated Staff could phrase the letter to make the case that the
City could make improvements cost effectively.

Council Member Burt recalled that two years previously the City requested
Caltrain evaluate the lengths of existing platforms. Finally Caltrain agreed to
consider it in the future. It took three years for Caltrain to consider level
boarding.

Council Member Holman inquired whether it was appropriate to state that
the City supported $20 million to the current point in time.

Mr. Keene advised Staff would make a larger case with other examples and
argue for more.

Council Member Holman asked if the letter would be consistent with the
Council's concerns regarding the Caltrain Draft Environmental Impact Report
(DEIR).

Mr. Keene indicated Staff would phrase it as "on the funding side."

Council Member Price inquired whether the Motion revised language
concerning the repayment condition for the $91 million.

Mr. Hackmann clarified that the Motion requested the contribution of $20
million and the repayment of the $91 million loan, with that funding going
towards Caltrain's consideration of platform lengthening and other things.

Mayor Shepherd recalled the City requested Caltrain consider platform
length in the original comment period.  At the PAC meeting, Caltrain
explained that they could not consider platform length without having
funding for such a project.
