Council Member Cordell asked whether Ms. Ogawa received a response to
her comments about notification.

Mr. Emslie said staff understood the Council's motion included codification of
the noticing.

Council Member Cordell asked whether the streamlining process would affect
large projects, such as Albertson's.

Mr. Emslie said for large projects the applicant had the opportunity to
engage in a prescreening process.

Council Member Cordell asked whether there was a legal requirement that
the City Council had to be the final arbiter on the issue of an individual
putting up a home.

Ms. Furth said there was none.

Council Member Cordell asked whether there had been any discussion of
eliminating the Council entirely from the streamlining process. She
expressed her concern about whether the Council had the expertise to weigh
in on such matters.

Ms. Furth said the City Charter did not permit the Council to delegate
authority to Boards/Commissions; however, they could delegate authority to
staff. It became apparent that staff hearings did not resolve disputes.
Because they could not make final decisions, staff was left with the option of
putting those items on the Council's Consent Calendar. Any other approach
would require a Charter amendment.

Mr. Benest said if the threshold was not high enough, the present
procedures would continue as they had been.

Mr. Griffin said the P&TC did provide an opportunity for persons to fine tune
their arguments.

Council Member Kleinberg referred to Section 18.76.020(b)(D)(v) of the
draft ordinance and asked whether the definition of "minor" was a standard
one, a controlling one, or for the exclusive use of the ARB.

Ms. Furth said the definition of "minor" applied only to that subsection.

Council Member Kleinberg asked whether the definition of "minor" was
similar, if not identical elsewhere in the PAMC.
