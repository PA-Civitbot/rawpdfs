Vice Mayor Espinosa asked if there was a way to publish the ads in the
newspaper with less information to help reduce cost.

City Clerk, Donna Grider proposed to shorten the titles in the ads.

Mayor Burt suggested having a Motion to make our official announcement be
the online version but to create a policy to have more common language
describe agenda items. The titles would be more complete but not legalistic.

Ms. Grider said that was possible, but would need funds added back into the
City Clerk’s budget account since it had been removed during the budget
process.

Council Member Klein asked what the policy in other cities was.

Ms. Grider said other cities followed the Brown Act but did not publish the
full agenda in newspapers.

Council Member Klein asked if Ms. Grider knew of other cities that published
full agendas.

Ms. Grider said she did not.

Council Member Klein asked if the issue was ever brought up at Clerk’s
Association meetings.

Ms. Grider said it had not. She said the agenda was continually shown on
the Government Channel 26 and accessible through Comcast.

Council Member Price asked if it would be cost-effective to shorten the
agenda titles.

Ms. Grider said there would be a cost-savings but could not say how much or
what percentage.

Herb Borock, asked to not stop the publications. Funds had been cut from
the City Clerk’s budget to help with the City’s budget deficit and hoped the
Council could find the funds to continue the publications.

Council Member Yeh asked whether the City was getting a special rate from
the Weekly.
