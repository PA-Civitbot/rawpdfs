noted the tiers force conservation and as established in the Cost of Services
Study, they satisfy Proposition 218.

Council Member Scharff stated that he believed Alternative One to be in line
with Proposition 218.

Council Member Shepherd stated she strongly supported Alternative Two.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION: Council Member Shepherd moved, seconded by
Vice Mayor Yeh to move Staff recommendation to:

   1. Increase overall retail water rates and annual revenues for the Water
      Fund by 12.5 percent or $3.4 million in Fiscal Year (FY) 2012; and

   2. Amend Utility Water Rate Schedules W-1, W-3, W-4, and W-7, as
      attached.

Council Member Shepherd stated that during the Finance Committee
discussions on this subject Staff provided an explanation about the analysis
of the interest that Palo Alto residents had in conservation and moving
forward with Proposition 218 compliance with fixed rates increasing by 100
percent both this and next year. She stated that would be more appropriate
for the Palo Alto community.

Council Member Burt stated it should be clear to the public that under Tier 1
there was a reduction, absent the increase in fixed rates. He noted it was
adding 100 percent this year, and only 50 percent next year.

Council Member Shepherd disagreed.

Council Member Burt asked for clarification on the increase.

Ms. Fong stated Council Member Burt was correct.

Council Member Schmid noted that there was a Cost of Services Study that
focused on customer classes. He stated that the requirements on the
residential side had not been addressed. He stated that moving forward,
even if the rates were approved, there would be a Cost of Services study for
any rate increase that might be appropriate next year. He asked if that was
correct.

Ms. Fong replied yes.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION FAILED: 3-5 Schmid, Shepherd, Yeh yes
