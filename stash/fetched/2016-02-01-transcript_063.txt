Mr. Bobel: Yes. It goes into a tank. We'll work on that detail.

Council Member Schmid: It's not very clear. We should know what we're
voting on.

Mr. Keene: We'll do that. I would just also say that we're going to have to
have interaction between a homeowner or an applicant and our Staff who
will be charged with overseeing whether or not they're complying with these
things. Just like at the Development Center, I mean there all sorts of things
we may not be facile with, but the folks who have to regulate it ...

Mayor Burt: Council Member Schmid, if you wanted to add language that
the flow rate will be metered, why don't you offer that as a proposed
amendment? If you don't, then you're free to make whatever amendment.

Council Member Schmid: It would be helpful to have a simple sentence,
"6A," saying the dewatering flow will be metered.

Mayor Burt: Do the maker and the seconder accept that?

Vice Mayor Scharff: That's fine.

Council Member Kniss: (inaudible) saying yes?

Council Member Berman: Yeah, Scharff said yes.

Mayor Burt: You as the seconder?

Council Member Kniss: yes.

Mayor Burt: That's incorporated into the Motion.

AMENDMENT RESTATED AND INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION
WITH THE CONSENT OF THE MAKER AND SECONDER to add to Part A of
the Motion, “add a sixth change, ‘dewatering flow will be metered.’”

Mayor Burt: Anything else?

Council Member Schmid: What about a cap on household dewatering?

Mr. Bobel: We didn't feel that we could propose that as a recommendation
without a lot of very serious homework. Therefore, we put it in Group 3.

Council Member Schmid: We are headed into a year where we're not
putting any constraints on the number or the amount.
