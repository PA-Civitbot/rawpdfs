MOTION: Council Member Barton moved, seconded by Kishimoto, to
approve staff and Planning and Transportation Commission (P&TC)
recommendation to adopt the ordinance to approve specific sections of a
new Chapter 18.16 of the Zoning Ordinance for the Community Commercial
(CC) zoning district, encompassing revisions to the uses and standards
provided in current Chapter 18.43, particularly relative to limiting residential
use in that district and providing increased potential for hotels.

Council Member Barton stated the zoning made sense and opened the
possibility of mixed-use and housing.

Vice Mayor Kishimoto complimented the Staff and the Planning Commissionâ€™s
work.

Council Member Morton asked about the benefit to attract hotel business.

Mr. Williams stated the increase of twenty-five percent of usable space
would be enough of an incentive to attract a hotel.

Council Member Morton said twenty-five percent of usable space could then
be residential condominiums.

Council Member Drekmeier inquired about Proposition 90 being considered a
down zoning.

City Attorney Gary Baum said if the courts determined there was any type of
down zoning, the City paid the difference.

Council Member Drekmeier stated the project appeared to be an up zone,
which allowed more development.

Mayor Kleinberg supported the motion.

MOTION PASSED 5-1, Morton no, Cordell, Klein not participating, Mossar
absent.
