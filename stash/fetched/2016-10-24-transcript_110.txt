Mayor Burt: I would say residents and workers. I would leave off Palo Alto
and just say residents and workers. It's both.

Council Member Wolbach: That's fine.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to add to the Motion Part C, “and improve
mobility for residents and workers” after “in the community.”

Mayor Burt: Council Member Schmid.

Council Member Schmid: I would like to add a sentence on maybe the
second paragraph that says all members will get a full description of the
annual Stanford Medical Center traffic mitigation program.

Mayor Burt: I'm not going to accept that, because I think there's actually a
number of reference points. We have Stanford University TMA. We have
the Research Park TMA that is probably doing some things that even the
hospital one isn't. I'm not convinced that—the hospital one was cutting edge
for within our City at the time it was formed. I'm not so sure how current it
is.

Council Member Schmid: The advantage of the Stanford Medical Center is
they state each year each program they have. They state how much they
spend on the program.

Mayor Burt: I'm not against including it, but I don't want to exclusively do
so.

Council Member Schmid: If you want to add others, but I would like them to
have some direction.

Mayor Burt: I'd like to include language that says the committee will look at
best TMA practices from within the Palo Alto/Stanford community and
elsewhere. How's that?

AMENDMENT:        Council Member Schmid moved, seconded by Council
Member XX to add to the Motion, “that all members will get a full description
of the annual Stanford Medical Center Traffic Mitigation Program.”

AMENDMENT FAILED DUE TO THE LACK OF A SECOND

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to add to the Motion Part D, “the Committee will
look at best TMA practices from within the Palo Alto/Stanford community and
elsewhere” after “trips in the community.”
