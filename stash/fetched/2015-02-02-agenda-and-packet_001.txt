         PUBLIC COMMENT
         Members of the public may speak to agendized items; up to three minutes per speaker, to be
         determined by the presiding officer. If you wish to address the Council on any issue that is on this
         agenda, please complete a speaker request card located on the table at the entrance to the Council
         Chambers, and deliver it to the City Clerk prior to discussion of the item. You are not required to give
         your name on the speaker card in order to speak to the Council, but it is very helpful.

         TIME ESTIMATES
         Time estimates are provided as part of the Council's effort to manage its time at Council meetings.
         Listed times are estimates only and are subject to change at any time, including while the meeting is
         in progress. The Council reserves the right to use more or less time on any item, to change the order
         of items and/or to continue items to another meeting. Particular items may be heard before or after
         the time estimated on the agenda. This may occur in order to best manage the time at a meeting or
         to adapt to the participation of the public. To ensure participation in a particular item, we suggest
         arriving at the beginning of the meeting and remaining until the item is called.
