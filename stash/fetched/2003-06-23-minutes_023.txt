Mr. James said he did not believe the funds were locked in if something
down the line came up.

Council Member Kishimoto wanted it defined as an amendment to a CIP, and
then the Council would have another chance to review the contract.

Ms. Harrison said that was correct.

Council Member Kishimoto asked if the step taken changed the CIP content.

Mr. James said yes.

Ms. Harrison said the Council should direct the staff to return with a Budget
Amendment Ordinance (BAO) that would change the CIP.

Council Member Kishimoto said it would increase by the $400,000.

Ms. Harrison said what was asked was for the project description to be
changed.

Council Member Kishimoto queried why the money was not being added.

Ms. Harrison said what would be changed would be the scope or the
description of what the first priorities would be in the project.

Council Member Kishimoto asked about tennis at the Winter Lodge, Mitchell,
Terman and Greer. She said she understood that location was in the Master
Plan earmarked for tennis.

Mr. James indicated it was the Greer location.

Council Member Kishimoto said there was no tennis group currently.

Mr. James said there would be an opportunity to amend the Master Plan.

Council Member Kishimoto asked if the tennis issue would be brought to the
Parks and Recreation Commission.

Mr. James said there would be neighborhood meetings as well as input from
the Parks and Recreation Commission.

Council Member Morton said he would defer to the public.

Chris Stirrat, 2575 Ross Road, said the use of the fields had exceeded the
ability to keep them maintained properly.
