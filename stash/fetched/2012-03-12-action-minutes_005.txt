Council Member Questions, Comments and Announcements

Council Member Shepherd reported that the Bus Rapid Transit Policy Advisory
Committee met the previous week. She suggested an informational meeting
with Staff to determine if Palo Alto could accommodate a dedicated bus lane
to enable her to properly represent Palo Alto on the committee.

Vice Mayor Scharff said he attended the Housing Methodology Committee
Meeting for Association of Bay Area Governments in the previous week. Palo
Alto received a low housing allocation for the year. The jobs-housing
imbalance was only a minimal factor in determining the allocation.

Council Member Burt announced on March 13, 2012 the High Speed Rail State
Senate Committee would hold a hearing at the Mountain View Performing Arts
Center at 7:00 pm. He encouraged the Council Members and the public to
attend.

Mayor Yeh stated the City of Tsuchiura gave Palo Alto a wooden replica of a
sailboat that would be delivered for display in City Hall shortly.

ADJOURNMENT: The meeting was adjourned at 12:50 A.M.
