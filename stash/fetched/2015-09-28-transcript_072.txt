Mr. Reichental: We would get vendors to respond to what that would cost
and what it would look like. We would bring that back to Council to say
whether, based on what they're seeing, whether we should do it or not.

Council Member Scharff: Isn't that really what we've asked you to do in
evaluate expanding wireless areas in retail areas, Scenario 1? I just thought
by putting this in here, we're asking you to do the buildings, the parks and
the retail areas and get that information.

Mr. Reichental: Yes.

Council Member Scharff: That was my understanding of it.

Mayor Holman: Council Member DuBois, are you good with adding those?

Council Member DuBois: Yeah.

Council Member Scharff: It would say "with an option for expanding Wi-Fi."

Council Member DuBois: David, that's under "B(b)(ii)."

Council Member Scharff: It's actually not there. Shouldn't it go under the
RFP, under "C"?

Council Member DuBois: That sentence should be moved under the RFP. As
part of the RFP.

Council Member Scharff:      Right, that's how Staff had it in their Staff
recommendation.

Council Member Burt: It's clear if you just say "as part of the RFP."

Mayor Holman: Council Member DuBois, Council Member Burt, you're both
good with that?

Council Member Burt: Yes.

Council Member DuBois: Yep.
