Mayor Kleinberg agreed with the ARB that there was an opportunity when
the matter went back to work more on the design. Architectural design was
not the business of the Council. The main motion was supported with an
acknowledgement to those who asked the Council to override the approval.
The Council was limited by what it could do.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION FAILED 1-8, Beecham voting yes.

Council Member Barton clarified whether the findings needed to be
incorporated into the motion or whether they were included, by the nature of
the recommendation.

Mr. Baum said the findings were included and the Council was adopting
attachment K.

AMENDMENT TO THE MOTION: Vice Mayor Kishimoto moved to not
approve the Design Enhancement Exception (DEE) for the side yard
encroachment.

Amendment failed for lack of second.

MOTION PASSED 8-1, Cordell voting no.
