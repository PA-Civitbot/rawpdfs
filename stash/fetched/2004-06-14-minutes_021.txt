MOTION: Vice Mayor Burch moved, seconded by Mossar, to appoint Gary
Baum as City Attorney and to authorize the Mayor to sign the employment
agreement.

     Employment Agreement

Council Member Freeman said the Employment Agreement stated Mr. Baum
would be credited with 96 hours of sick leave and 80 hours of vacation upon
the start of his employment. She asked how he would continue to accrue up
to 600 hours.

Mayor Beecham said the Compensation Plan specified how many hours
would be accrued per pay period.

Council Member Freeman said the specified number of accrual hours per pay
period was not specified in the Agreement.

City Manager Frank Benest said the formula for accruing vacation and sick
leave was published in the Management Compensation Plan.

Council Member Freeman supported the appointment of Gary Baum as City
Attorney; however, she disagreed with the Relocation Assistance package of
a loan up to the lower amount of $800,000 or 90 percent of the purchase
price or appraised value of a home within eight miles of City Hall, the City’s
cost or payment of flood insurance and earthquake insurance, and the nine-
month severance benefit package.

Council Member Morton expressed his support of Gary Baum as City
Attorney; however, he was opposed to the increased salary, and was
committed to internal advancement of City staff.

Vice Mayor Burch said when the City made a loan to a CAO, it was money
the City normally invested; only the rate was better.

MOTION PASSED 7-2, Morton, Ojakian “no.”
