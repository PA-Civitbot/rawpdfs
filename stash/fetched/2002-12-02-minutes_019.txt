Ms. Furth said the Dutra Bill encouraged litigation that challenged cities that
failed to meet their requirements by requiring the cities to pay the legal fees
of the prevailing party. If Palo Alto did not have a certified Housing Element,
it was missing a presumption that the Comp Plan was consistent and had a
valid Housing Element. There were practical advantages to the City in having
a good, suitable Housing Element adopted, including the tough competition
for funds.

Mayor Ojakian said the Dutra Bill put the City into an interesting position.
The City was trying to meet what the minimum requirements were.

MOTION: Council Member Lytle moved, seconded by Kishimoto, to approve
the Housing Sites Inventory.

Council Member Lytle clarified the Cityâ€™s ability to achieve BMR numbers in
the past relied on the partnership with the nonprofit community where
housing projects were built at 100 percent below market rate and did not
relied on the construction of housing.

Mr. Emslie said that was correct, and the Housing Element supported the
partnership.

Council Member Lytle said the inventory helped direct the nonprofit
community and developers as much as it helped the for-profit developers.

Mr. Emslie agreed.

Council Member Lytle said when the last Housing Element was adopted; the
City was in a different market situation. The bottom had dropped out of
housing development financing due to complications such as condominium
lawsuits.

Mr. Emslie said that was correct, and there was little private financing.

Council Member Lytle said the market at the current time fell out completely
underneath office development but focused on housing. The idea of
incentivizing was less necessary during a bull housing market.

Mr. Emslie said that was correct.

Council Member Lytle clarified the City was not amending the land use
diagram with the Housing Element.

Mr. Emslie said that was correct.
