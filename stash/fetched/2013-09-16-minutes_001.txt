STUDY SESSION

2.   Potential List of Topics for the Study Session with Assemblyman Rich
     Gordon.

Assemblyman Rich Gordon reported in January 2013 the Democrats had a
two-thirds majority in both Houses. There was a lot of speculation about the
Legislature rewriting Proposition 13, imposing new taxes and making
Constitutional changes. None of that happened. As the session ended, the
Legislature passed legislation increasing the minimum wage and authorizing
the issuance of driver's licenses to undocumented individuals, and acting on
a bill related to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).
