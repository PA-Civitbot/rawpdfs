 Planning and Transportation Commissioner Phyllis Cassel said the Planning
 and Transportation Commission (PTC) supported the original trial project
 because there was significant cross-traffic through the neighborhood.
 Enclosures were recommended as part of the Downtown North Plan.

 Daniel Sills, 296 Waverley Street, said he was in favor of the Traffic
 Calming Plan because Downtown was safer and tranquil.

 Jane Stern, 230 Emerson Street, said she was concerned about her
 community. Opening the streets was symbolic of re-opening the
 community.

 Ed Glazier, 255 Everett Street, said Downtown North was a walkable,
 livable neighborhood and a desirable location. Interior traffic at morning
 and afternoon commute times did not render the neighborhood less safe or
 desirable.

 Janice Hough, 189 Bryant Street, said she understood the desire to salvage
 the project because a lot of time and money had been spent on it. She
 suggested the project be thrown out.

 Robin Reynolds, 319 Everett Avenue, said she supported the traffic
 measures that had been put in place. The streets were not designed to
 support the number of cars, which sped through and parked in her
 neighborhood.

 Paul Dolkas, 412 Everett Avenue, said a survey of 584 residents showed 62
 percent supported the plan.

 Kay Hohbach, 333 Kipling Street, said her neighborhood was safer because
 of the traffic calming.

 Michelle Hamilton, 158 Emerson Street, said an extreme traffic situation in
 Downtown North existed and asked for support of traffic calming.

 Susan Tachna, 614 Everett Avenue, said the unique nature of the
 neighborhood required them to endure the weight of cut-through traffic
 from Willow Road.

 Jerry Schwarz, 230 Emerson Street, said he took surveys of the traffic flow
 in Downtown North. He believed the value of his community was the health
 of Downtown.
