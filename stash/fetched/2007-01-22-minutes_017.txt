Council Member Morton stated the companyâ€™s ability to operate was limited
when it got the 10 percent increase.

Mr. Baum said the business would have no ability to adjust its business if the
City did not give the opportunity for flexibility.

Council Member Morton stated that notification had been woefully
inadequate. Notifying only properties within 150 feet was not adequate.

Council Member Beecham asked staff about examples of uses that would be
affected.

Mr. Firth stated that, under the proposal, if someone wanted to install a tool
that used hazardous materials, the Fire Department would do an evaluation
to see if the business met the criteria, issue the permit, and then notify the
community that the permit was issued. Uses might include restaurants, dry
cleaners, gas stations, body shops, photo developing operations and plating
shops.

Mayor Kishimoto asked about residences.

Mr. Firth stated if a resident was authorized to run a business out of his or
her home and had hazardous materials, the resident would be subject to the
Fire Department requirements.

Council Member Beecham questioned whether gasoline qualified as one of
the items.

Mr. Firth stated gasoline was a hazardous material that was regulated under
the ordinance.

Council Member Morton stated the issue was how far the notification area
was.

AMENDMENT TO THE MOTION: Council Member Morton moved, seconded
by Barton, to increase public notification from 150 feet to 600 feet.

Council Member Barton suggested the language matrix might be based on
the planning process for the project.

Mr. Emslie stated the standard notification for land use decisions was 600
feet.

Council Member Mossar pointed out one speaker mentioned there were only
two Title 9 facilities in San Jose and asked staff whether that was accurate.
