Ms. Gitelman: If I understand it, the intention is that the ordinance would
not apply to applications that are shown as complete on this table, which
would be 441 Page Mill Road, 2555 Park, 425-29 University and 3877 El
Camino.

Council Member Filseth: 425 University, does that have to reapply?

Ms. Gitelman: Based on the Council's action, effectively they would have to
reapply and another application wouldn't be complete, so it's moot. Of
course, the applications that are listed here that are outside of the three
areas wouldn't apply either.

Mayor Holman: We are ready to vote on the board, Council Members. We
are moving to exempt projects applied for in 2013 or 2014 which
applications were complete by March 31, 2015 and exempt those from the
development cap. As one of the criteria considered as part of the 50,000
square foot cap ...

Council Member Wolbach: Scharff, you were making the motion, do you
want to clarify what the language was that you were offering as an
amendment?

Mayor Holman: It should be "and those projects whose applications were
not complete as of that date."

Council Member Scharff: What I meant was those projects that were
complete as of today's date. That's what I meant.

Mayor Holman: The projects that were complete as of today's date?

Council Member Scharff: Yes.

Council Member Wolbach:     That was what I understood when I agreed to
accept the amendment.

Mayor Holman: To make sure we're all clear on this. The motion is to
exempt projects applied for in 2013 or 2014 which applications were
complete March 31, 2015 from the development cap. For projects that the
application was complete June 15 as one of the criteria considered as part of
the 50,000 square foot capâ€”we know what we mean here, but it's not very
poetic.

Council Member Wolbach: Is this an amendment or a separate motion?
