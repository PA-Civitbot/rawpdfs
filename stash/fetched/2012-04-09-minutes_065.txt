Mayor Yeh said the added language was “PAUSD and the City
should work to continue community access to the extent
possible.”

Council Member Shepherd wanted to support Council Member
Holman’s added language. When referring to the recreation
facilities she asked if they meant the tennis courts and the fields.
She thought they needed to establish in the Guiding Principles
that they would somehow secure those fields for shared
community use. She said she understood it would go to the City
Council’s members of the CPAC to get the wording back for the
packet for next week. In which case there would be time to work
on the wording so that it did not have to be exact at that
evening’s meeting.

Mayor Yeh said that the Council Members on the CPAC would
receive the revised draft of the Guiding Principles for review and
inclusion in the packet for the next Council meeting.

Council Member Shepherd asked if they could have the three
members of the CPAC elaborate on the recreational facilities.

Mayor Yeh asked if the proposed language was acceptable to her:
“PAUSD and the City should work to continue community access
to the extent possible.”

Council Member Shepherd said yes, but thought that they might
want to go into that more deeply.

Mayor Yeh asked if there were any other changes to Guiding
Principle Number 13. He stated he had no changes to Guiding
Principles Number 14 or Number 15.

Council Member Holman said that philosophically she had
concerns about language such as “where possible” and “where
feasible.” She understood the intention, but language that talked
