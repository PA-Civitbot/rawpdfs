Hillary Gitelman, Planning and Community Environment Director: Thank
you, Mayor Holman and Council Members.            I'm Hillary Gitelman, the
Planning Director. I also want to thank Amy French, who's here with me
today, and Cara Silver for her assistance in preparation for tonight's
meeting. The item before you is adoption of an Urgency Interim Ordinance
protecting ground-floor retail.   The purpose of tonight's meeting is to
conduct a public hearing and adopt the proposed Ordinance essentially
perpetuating the status quo. This idea first arose at the Council's discussion
on March 2nd. If you recall, we were talking about the pace of job growth
and office development in Palo Alto. It was noted that, given current
economic conditions, there was almost an incentive for conversion of
ground-floor retail space to office use where that was permitted by our
Zoning Ordinance. Subsequently on April 6th the Council gave very specific
direction on the nature of an Urgency Ordinance the Council wished to
                                                                         Page 17 of 92
