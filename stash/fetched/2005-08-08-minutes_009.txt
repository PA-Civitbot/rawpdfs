Council Member Morton said he was concerned about the impact on the
General Fund.

Ms. Harrison said a property tax increase would pay the general obligation
bond.

Council Member Morton said the police building needed to be upgraded, but
he was concerned about the cost.

Council Member Cordell said a building was needed that enabled the police to
operate properly.

Vice Mayor Kleinberg said research was being conducted to determine
whether there were developers who could provide the City with a better
arrangement.

Council Member Freeman asked whether removing the necessity of owning
property Downtown would open the process.

Ms. Erickson said staff had a preference of a Downtown location.            The
developer would have control of a parcel; a site would be part of the project.

Mr. Baum said it was requested that the site control requirement be removed.

Council Member Freeman noted that requirement had not been changed.

Vice Mayor Kleinberg said a combination of public and private land was
allowed.

Council Member Freeman said if a developer, or a construction company with
a developer, found land they would have the ability to compete with someone
who could to deliver fee title to land.

Ms. Harrison said the criteria required an essential services facility to be
placed in a suitable area; the land could be private, a combination of public
and private land, or it could be the identification of a publicly appropriate
police building.

Council Member Beecham said a funding plan had been received from staff.

MOTION PASSED 8-1, Kishimoto no.
