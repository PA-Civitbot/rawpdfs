Council Member Yeh inquired whether the approval of the Amendment would
create a dual process to the procedure that was already in place by Staff and
the P&TC.

Mr. Williams stated the issues regarding basements had been discussed and
was currently before the P&TC. He stated the Amendment was a logical
topic as a side discussion with what had already been discussed.

Council Member Espinosa spoke on the need to set limits on growth and
development in the OS. However, he did not share the same concerns of all
the Council Members.

Council Member Burt inquired whether there was a point system that
required off-setting points if a basement was built in the Build It Green
Policy.

Mr. Williams stated yes.

Council Member Burt stated he would be opposing the Amendment;
however, he looked forward to a future Agenda Item detailing broader
basement guidelines.
