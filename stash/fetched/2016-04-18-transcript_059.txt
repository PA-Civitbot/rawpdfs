Mayor Burt: At this time we're convening a public hearing. Can the
members of the public please go to the lobby to continue your conversation.
At this time, we're going to move on to Item Number 11 which is a public
hearing. It's regarding the adoption of a prospective Ordinance establishing
a Single Story Overlay (SSO) District for 202 homes within the Royal Manor
Tract Number 1556. Welcome to our Staff. I'm sorry. Before we continue,
we have two Council Members who need to speak. Council Member Schmid.

Council Member Schmid: I have a home in Royal Manor and should not
participate in the meeting tonight.

Mayor Burt: Council Member Wolbach.

Council Member Wolbach: I also live right in the middle of Royal Manor,
right around the corner from Council Member Schmid. It's great to see so
many of my neighbors here tonight. I've never seen so much of Royal
Manor here. It's wonderful to see you all. I'm sorry I won't be able to weigh
in on this important discussion.

Council Members Schmid and Wolbach left the meeting at 9:50 P.M.

Mayor Burt: Before hearing from the Staff, I should share for the members
of the public here what we anticipate will be the process tonight. Because of
the hour, we think that what we will be able to do is have our Staff
presentation.    We will not have Council Member comments preceding
hearing from members of the public. We will hear from members of the
public. Because we have 57 speaker cardsâ€”some of them are combined,
                                                                       Page 59 of 93
