AMENDMENT DIED FOR LACK OF A SECOND

MOTION PASSED          AS   AMENDED      7-0,   Morton,   Mossar   “not
participating.”

Council Member Ojakian suggested placing a monitoring mechanism
for an annual review of the area.

Vice Mayor Beecham asked whether staff would bring back a
monitoring mechanism with the ordinance.

Mr. Emslie said yes.

Council Member Freeman asked for clarification on the time of the
ordinance coming back to the Council and the election. The concern
was 800 High Street.

Mr. Emslie said the draft ordinance would return to the Council in late
October.

Council Member Freeman asked whether it was reasonable to have the
draft ordinance return to Council after the election. Having something
come back a few weeks before an election might be influential to the
vote.

Council Member Lytle said she was baffled by the notion of waiting
until after the election when the Council had been consistent about
saying it wanted to take action prior to the election. The P&TC had an
opportunity to comment to the Council prior to the return of the
ordinance.

Ms. Furth said staff would return with a resolution that amended the
Coordinated Area Plan (CAP) map and an ordinance that adopted the
CAP as the zoning and plan for the area. Both documents were before
the P&TC twice.

Vice Mayor Beecham said there was a desire earlier in the meeting to
hear from the P&TC liaison during the process, although he declined to
do that. In the past, he recalled a P&TC representative sat at the staff
table to provide comments. The issue was referred to P&S to clarify
the role of boards and commissions in participating in Council in
discussions after public hearings were closed.
