Council Member Wolbach:       It would be "climate change and sea level
adaptation."

Council Member Burt: After "climate protection."

Mayor Holman: No. David, it's "protection, sea level adaptation."

Council Member Wolbach: Actually no. It would be "climate change and sea
level adaptation."

Council Member DuBois:      I think we're getting beyond the point.   I
understand it. I think that's acceptable. We don't need to wordsmith it
precisely.

Council Member Wolbach: Is that amenable?

Council Member DuBois: Yep.

Mayor Holman: Council Member Burt?

Council Member Burt: Yep.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to add to the Motion Part A, “climate adaptation
and sea level rise” after “climate protection.”

Council Member Wolbach: On "C," I would suggest changing the word "goal"
to "direct Staff and CAC."

Council Member DuBois: Yes. Thank you.

Mayor Holman: Council Member Burt?

Council Member Burt: Yes.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to replace in the Motion Part C, “Goal” with “direct
Staff and the Comprehensive Plan Citizen Advisory Committee (CAC).”

Council Member Wolbach: I think we also want to add some—I would like to
see us add some language about encouraging or enabling the CAC to work
on complex issues that cut across multiple Elements, unless they're already
doing that and don't need any further direction.

Ms. Gitelman: They're already doing that.

Mayor Holman: I don't know what that means, Council Member Wolbach.
