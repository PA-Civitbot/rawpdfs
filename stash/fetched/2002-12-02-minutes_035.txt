Vice Mayor Mossar said another hurdle was created. There was a lot of
density on San Antonio Road.

Council Member Kleinberg asked if the wording would preclude some very
high and high-density housing where there was not any.

Council Member Kishimoto said the wording encouraged or allowed
neighborhood services. If there were no neighborhood commercial,
affordable housing should not be held up.

AMENDMENT FAILED 2-7, Kishimoto, Lytle “yes.”

AMENDMENT: Council Member Kleinberg moved, seconded by Mossar, in
Policy H-2, page 7, change the word “consider” to “identify and implement.”

AMENDMENT PASSED 5-4 Beecham, Freeman, Kishimoto, Ojakian “no.”

AMENDMENT: Council Member Kleinberg moved, seconded by Mossar, in
Program H-19, page 17, change the word “Consider” to “Eliminate.”

Council Member Kleinberg said the intent of the word change was to
demonstrate the Council’s firm commitment to make the Housing Element
happen.

Council Member Freeman understood the commitment issue but also realized
there were often unintended consequences that came up. Using language
that stated unequivocally eliminate did not allow any room for change.

Council Member Kleinberg said the explanatory paragraph said, “eliminating
the requirement would expedite project approval and remove an impediment
to housing production.”

Council Member Morton suggested adding, “review the requirement.”

Council Member Lytle agreed with the amendment because the site and
design review process was applied to mixed use because the City did not
have decent mixed-use regulations.

AMENDMENT PASSED 5-4, Freeman, Kishimoto, Morton, Ojakian “no.”

AMENDMENT: Council Member Kleinberg moved, seconded by Lytle, in
Policy H-14, page 26, change “The City should” to “The City will.”

AMENDMENT PASSED 9-0.
