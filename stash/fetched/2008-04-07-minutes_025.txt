INCORPORATED INTO THE AMENDMENT by the maker and seconder to
include a study session with P&TC within 90 days.

Council Member Barton stated that an early policy meeting made sense but
only having one meeting and not two. The meeting should address all the
issues and not just the housing.

Council Member Schmid responded he would accept what the Council
considered as policy issues to be discussed.

Council Member Burt inquired if the Amendment included a joint study
session with P&TC preceding policy discussion.

Council Member Schmid replied it would be good to have study session with
P&TC and Staff on policy issues.

Council Member Burt confirmed that policy recommendations would not be
made at the study session but at the agendized Council meeting.

Mayor Klein stated he had one concern that the Council Members should not
be in the position of advising P&TC on what they should recommend to the
Council.

Council Member Espinosa clarified that the Council would not be making
policy recommendations at the study session.

Council Member Kishimoto stated her concern that under Attachment B the
Council would not see it until month 31. She asked if that actual work plan
was going to be adopted and should the Council give directions for more
regular check-ins.

Mr. Emslie replied that general directions would work within that work plan.

AMENDMENT PASSED: 9-0

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION by the maker and seconder to
include a subsequent special Council meeting to provide policy direction
within a reasonable time frame.
