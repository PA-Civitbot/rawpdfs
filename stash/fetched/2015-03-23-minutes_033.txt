Council Member Burt agreed. That should not be a part of the Interim
Ordinance but an interim zoning measure.

Mayor Holman asked where it could be included.

Ms. Gitelman reported the Council had a limited number of meetings in
which it could craft Interim Ordinances, permanent strategies and
Comprehensive Plan Update programs.

Mayor Holman was not aware of another opportunity to include the CN FAR
issue.

Council Member Burt suggested the City Clerk agendize it as other interim
measures for the May 4th meeting.

Mr. Keene reiterated that Staff would return in two weeks with a definitive
schedule. The May 4th Agenda was full. The introduction of the Motion
directed Staff to return with an Interim Ordinance. He understood the
Council had moved away from that to an in-depth discussion of the items
noted in the Motion.

Council Member Burt agreed with Mr. Keene. He suggested the following
language: return for a discussion of elements of an Interim Ordinance. He
asked if it was acceptable to the Maker and Seconder.

Mr. Keene indicated Staff would provide more details in relation to items in
the Motion. At a subsequent meeting, the Council could return to those
issues.

Council Member Burt offered language of "in consideration of any other
interim zoning measures." He believed leaving it open ended without being
specific to allow for a more specific discussion at a later meeting.

Mayor Holman wanted to ensure it was addressed.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to include discussion of any additional interim
zoning change measures.

MOTION AS AMENDED PASSED: 9-0

Mayor Holman asked the City Attorney if she had sufficiently specific
information to address conflicts of interest.

Ms. Stump responded yes.
