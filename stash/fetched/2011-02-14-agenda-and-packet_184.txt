Unsignalized Intersections
Level of service at unsignalized intersections also is based on the 2000 Highway Capacity
Manual (2000 HCM) method. The TRAFFIX software is used to apply the 2000 HCM
operations method for evaluation of conditions at unsignalized intersections. The delay

and corresponding level of service at unsignalized, stop-controlled intersections is
presented in Table 2. The reported LOS represents the average delay of all intersection
movements.

Link Level of Service
Roadway links were analyzed using volume to capacity (V/C) ratios. The volume was
measured in the field using recent traffic counts. The volumes used for the analysis were
based on the day of the week with the highest daily traffic volume, which for all study
segments was Friday, November 5th 2010. Using the highest day’s traffic data, the counts
were further disaggregated into AM, Midday, and PM peak hour volumes. The capacity of
each study segment was derived from the Highway Capacity Manual, 2000 published by
the Transportation Research Board. According to the Highway Capacity Manual, an urban
minor arterial (Class 4) has an approximate capacity of 800 vehicles per hour (Table 10-7).
However, because of the presence of on-street parking, an additional reduction in capacity
was applied per the publication, Parking, by Weant and Levinson (Table 11-1). Thus, for
this analysis, each two lane directional segment was assumed to have a capacity of
approximately 1,360 vehicles per hour and each one lane directional segment was
assumed to have a capacity of 560 vehicles per hour. For each link, the peak hourly
volume was divided by the capacity to calculate a V/C ratio. This was then correlated to a
level of service per Table 3.
