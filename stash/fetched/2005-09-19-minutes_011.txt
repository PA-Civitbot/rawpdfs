whatever type of interest rate the Council directed.

should be made based on the new information provided.

majority support.

of the Cityâ€™s budget to support the undergrounding.

homes.

mortgages.

reviewed.

the value of the home.

Mr. Baum said under the terms of a reverse mortgage, taking additional
lending against it could be prohibited.

Council Member Ojakian said staff would review the issues.

Mr. Benest said all the issues related to the items would be reviewed; he
requested any ideas or questions to be sent to staff.
