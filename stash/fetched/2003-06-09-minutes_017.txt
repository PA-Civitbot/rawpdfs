Ms. Grote said it was listed as the Children’s International School. For
several years, it was the Jewish Day School and the Children’s International
School was interested in occupying it.

Council Member Morton asked how land use assumptions could be made on
the section between Alma Street and Middlefield Road on East Meadow
Road, sites 14, 15 and 5, since it was not a contiguous area.

Ms. Grote said it was background traffic that would be accounted for in the
traffic model. The moratorium applied to the blue sites on the map.

Council Member Morton clarified background traffic would include evaluation
of traffic in that area.

Ms. Grote said it would be considered.

Council Member Morton asked staff to respond to the concerns of the
community and asked when the schedule of stakeholders meetings would be
available to the public.

Mr. Emslie said the schedule was just finalized and ready for distribution.

Council Member Morton asked if work was being done to come up with
proposals on left-turn pocket areas and would it be possible to work with Mr.
Kott to implement those during the study period.           Would it provide
information about the behavior and give some indication of whether one of
the other goals could be met regarding the issue of school corridor safety.

Mr. Emslie said there was that possibility, but explained the left-turn pockets
issue was a funding issue.

Council Member Morton asked whether it could be pursued if funding was
found within the next 10 months.

Mr. Emslie said it would be pursued.

Council Member Morton asked if school corridor safety would be an
important parameter in the current evaluation.

Mr. Emslie said it was the highest criteria.

Council Member Beecham needed clarification that any policies mentioned in
the Comp Plan, as well as policies mentioned by the public, would be
included in the study.
