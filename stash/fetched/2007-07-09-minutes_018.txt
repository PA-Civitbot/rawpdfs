13.   From Finance Committee: Request to Increase the City’s Transient
      Occupancy Tax

      Resolution 8732 entitled “Resolution of the Council of the City of Palo
      Alto, Submitting to the Qualified Electors of the City at the November
      6, 2007, General Municipal Election a Measure Related to the City’s
      Transient Occupancy Tax (TOT) which would increase the TOT from
      10% to 12%”

Council Member Morton noted the surrounding areas currently had higher
TOT’s than Palo Alto and he did not feel an increase of such a small amount
would deter visitors to the City.

Director of Administrative Services Carl Yeats said the recommendation for
the TOT increase was to generate revenue.

Vice Mayor Klein asked why the language recommended by the Finance
Committee to collect from the larger travel companies was deleted.

City Attorney Gary Baum stated there was ongoing litigation involving
certain travel companies. Therefore, to avoid involvement, the language
was deleted after strong consideration.
