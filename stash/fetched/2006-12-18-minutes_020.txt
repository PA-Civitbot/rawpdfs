Mayor Kleinberg said the six-month timeframe was determined by the Board
of Supervisors. She brought up the fact the City had not moved forward with
a plan to counter the attacks on the Airport. She felt it was important to
jump quickly into a position to become more informed, with more
opportunities to negotiate. There was no resource or staff impact because
the Colleagues Memo was not direction to staff but was for an independent
working group. It was not a perfect process, but she believed the Council
should do whatever they could to move forward.

Council Member Drekmeier asked whether the PAAWG would be appointed
by the current Mayor.

Mayor Kleinberg said yes and it would comply with the Brown Act.

Council Member Drekmeier asked whether a Council Liaison would also be
appointed.

Mayor Kleinberg said yes. It would be a representative from the Council.

Council Member Drekmeier concurred with Vice Mayor Kishimoto regarding
inclusion of two individuals from the stakeholder groups.

Vice Mayor Kishimoto clarified there would be no paid staff time included on
the Working Group.

Mayor Kleinberg said it would be up to the City Manager as to who would be
useful.

Vice Mayor Kishimoto asked whether City staff would negotiate with County
staff.

Mayor Kleinberg said the Working Group would not be doing the negotiating.
City staff was in charge of negotiating, and the Council was in charge of
developing policy matters and directing staff. The PAAWG would bring back
ideas and models to the City Manager and Council, which would be accepted
or not.

Vice Mayor Kishimoto asked for clarification on whether there would be
representatives from the Baylands Master Plans and Flood Control on the
working group.

Mr. Benest said staff would provide those perspectives.
