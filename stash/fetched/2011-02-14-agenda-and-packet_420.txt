NESHAP imposes emission limits for beryllium, as well as sampling requirements. See 40 CFR Part 61, Subpart
C. These NESHAPs are expressly incorporated into the 40 CFR Part 503 requirements for POTWs.




                                                                                                                    Attachment: PA Comments EPA HQ-OAR-2009-0559_Final (1297 : EPA Proposed Rule on Sewage Sludge Incinerators)
        Emissions from SSIs are already regulated by other Congressionally-mandated, comprehensive
regulations that are adequately protective of human health and the environment. Accordingly, no public health
or environmental benefit will be realized from including SSIs under CAA § 129.

       B.      The 1990 CAA Amendments Direct EPA to Regulate POTWs Under § 112

       CAA § 112(e)(5) requires EPA to establish NESHAP for POTWs. Section 112(e)(5) states:

               The Administrator shall promulgate standards pursuant to subsection (d) of this
               section [112] applicable to publicly owned treatments works (as defined in title II
               of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act [33 U.S.C.A. § 1281 et seq.]) not later
               than 5 years after November 15, 1990.

42 U.S.C. § 7412(e)(5).

       The definition of “treatment works” contained in Title II is broad and includes:

               … any devices and systems used in the storage, treatment, recycling, and reclamation
               of municipal sewage or industrial wastes of a liquid nature to implement [section
               201 of the Act], or necessary to recycle or reuse water at the most economical cost
               over the useful life of the works, including intercepting sewers, outfall sewers,
               sewage collection systems, pumping, power, and other equipment, and their
               appurtenances; extensions, improvements, remodeling, additions, and
               alterations thereof; elements essential to provide a reliable recycled supply such
               as standby treatment units and clear well facilities; and any works, including site
               acquisition of the land that will be an integral part of the treatment process
               (including land used for the storage of treated wastewater in land treatment
               systems prior to land application) or is used for ultimate disposal of residues
               resulting from such treatment.

33 U.S.C. § 212(2)(A) (emphasis added).

       This language clearly encompasses the areas of a POTW used to manage sewage sludge, including the
incinerators that are “used for ultimate disposal of residues resulting from” the sewage treatment process.
Congress’ intentional use of this well-understood term in CAA § 112(e)(5) has no other conceivable meaning.
Likewise, EPA’s regulatory definition of “treatment works” makes clear the expansive meaning of the term
under the CWA. The definition at 40 CFR § 35.905 includes:

               Any devices and systems for the storage, treatment, recycling, and reclamation of
               municipal sewage, domestic sewage, or liquid industrial wastes used to implement
               section 201 of the Act, or necessary to recycle or reuse water at the most
