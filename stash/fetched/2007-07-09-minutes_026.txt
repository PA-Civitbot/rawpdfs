COUNCIL  COMMENTS,          ANNOUNCEMENTS,         AND     REPORTS      FROM
CONFERENCES

Council Member Barton announced he recently attended the California
League of Cities Policy Committee Meeting in San Jose on Environmental
Quality and did not have anything to report.

Council Member Drekmeier questioned how Palo Alto had been incorrectly
listed as opposing The Healthy Pet Act (AB1634) when Palo Alto had not
taken a position.

Assistant City Manager Emily Harrison said a letter from the Animal Services
Division of the Police Department had been sent to the Local Government
Committee in Sacramento providing input on AB1634. The letter was
speaking only for the Animal Services Division, and not the City of Palo Alto.

Council Member Morton noted he was the Cityâ€™s representative at the 2007
Louisville, Kentucky, Senior Games, and was impressed by the enthusiastic
and remarkable seniors.

Council Member Kleinberg noted there was a driver who had been killed on
the railroad tracks that evening and she encouraged revisiting the subject of
grade separations.
