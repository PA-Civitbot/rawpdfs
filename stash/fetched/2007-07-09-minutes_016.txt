Council Member Drekmeier said the $65,000 request was still required.

Mr. Saccio said yes.

Council Member Cordell asked whether the response adequately addressed
the City Auditor’s concerns.

Ms. Erickson stated her concerns were met by the 180 Connect responses.

Council Member Cordell felt unsettled by receiving the response at such a
short time.

Council Member Drekmeier asked what the consortium would do if 180
Connect folded prior the completion of the business plan.

Ron Ivy, 180 Connect, said the primary focus was to look at a business plan
to create a financial model for the project to move forward.

Steve Westberg, 180 Connect, said his role was working on advancing the
company which is on the cusp of a radical strength in the company’s balance
sheet.

Mayor Kishimoto asked whether it was a cash investment.

Mr. Westberg advised it was a $42,000,000 commitment and completion
was expected August 15, 2007.

Mayor Kishimoto asked whether there was a back-up situation.

Mr. Westberg said there were secondary investments lined-up with a slightly
different structure with the same capitalization.

Mayor Kishimoto asked whether the consortium could move forward without
180 Connect.

Mr. Ivy stated there were multiple partners in the consortium working
together, so that in the event one partner drops out, there would be a
secondary to complete the business plan.

Council Member Cordell asked for clarification on the information in the
resume provided by Mr. Jones.
