Mr. Rodriguez reiterated the total cost increase was $300,000.

Council Member Burt asked if the $300,000 increase resulted from costs of
construction.

Mr. Rodriguez answered the cost of construction and the $75,000 loss of
grant funds.

Council Member Burt said grant funds were not costs of construction. He
asked if the $300,000 cost increase was comprised of $225,000 additional
costs of construction, $75,000 loss of grant funding, plus whatever internal
costs.

Mr. Rodriguez responded yes.

Council Member Burt felt the impact from lawsuits was probably $350,000.
He inquired whether Staff asked litigants to contribute to that difference. He
noted Mr. Moss' claim regarding an additional $800,000-$900,000 for street
impact on storm drains, and asked if the claim was valid.

Mr. Rodriguez reported the current $1 million in additional amenities
included everything for the Project. He did not know of a basis for Mr. Moss'
claim.

Council Member Burt inquired whether Staff's figures included all costs.

Mr. Rodriguez replied yes.

Council Member Klein asked why Staff did not present a lighting element for
the Project to the Council in 2012.

Mr. Rodriguez indicated the original project did not include any lighting.
When Staff redesigned the Project to include sidewalk widening and
additional amenities, they focused only on that additional element and did
not recommend lighting to keep the costs down.

Council Member Klein inquired whether there was a particular proponent for
the lighting element.

Mr. Rodriguez reported lighting was a consistent comment from the
community, residents, and visitors. Widening the sidewalk provided an
opportunity to include lighting. The estimated cost of $1 million for lighting
was for construction during the Project. If lighting was its own project, the
cost would be approximately $1.3 million.
