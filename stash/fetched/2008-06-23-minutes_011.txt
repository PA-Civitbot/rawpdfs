Mr. Roberts stated there were ongoing preliminary long range discussions
regarding the location with both Sunnyvale and San Jose.

Vice Mayor Drekmeier asked who paid for the construction and demolition
(C&D) costs.

Mr. Roberts asked whether he was referring to the basic program or the
bonus program under the innovations.

Vice Mayor Drekmeier thought there was a cost to C&D and a rate impact of
2.6 percent and asked who bared the increase.

Mr. Roberts stated it was borne through the charges which were
incorporated into the C&D program through the permits, plans, and the
necessary collection bins.

Vice Mayor Drekmeier asked whether the calculations included the cost
increases and savings in rates schedules as shown in the Smart Station and
Kirby Canyon Landfill.

Mr. Roberts stated yes.

Vice Mayor Drekmeier asked for clarification on the incentive programs for
can size.

Mr. Reiser stated the mini cans were 20-gallon size and the mini service rate
was less than the standard service rate.

Vice Mayor Drekmeier asked if 20-gallons was the smallest size available.

Mr. Reiser stated yes, at approximately 11 dollars per month.

Vice Mayor Drekmeier asked whether households could use smaller cans and
pay less then 11 dollars per month.

Mr. Roberts stated not under the current rate structure. The rate structure
will return to Council in late 2008 or early 2009. He stated the current issues
pertained to hauler fees with staying in compliance with Proposition 18.

Mayor Klein emphasized the cost figures were maximum figures subject to
downward negotiation.

Mr. Roberts agreed but cautioned although staff had used the worst case
scenario, some costs could go up.
