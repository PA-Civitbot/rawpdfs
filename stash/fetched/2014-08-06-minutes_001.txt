Steve Downing favored growth in Palo Alto.      Generally, zoning plans were
hostile towards new residents of Palo Alto.     He was interested in smart,
substantive expansion.

Vicky indicated finding affordable housing in Palo Alto was more difficult than
finding a job. By doing nothing to solve the housing problem, the Council
effectively priced out and excluded the next generation from Palo Alto.

Katie Myers could not afford to live in Palo Alto once she and her husband
had children. She supported growth for Palo Alto.
