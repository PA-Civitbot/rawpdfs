Council Member Mossar clarified the recommendation from the P&TC only
approved the overlay zone on the one area on the east side of Highway 101.

Mr. Emslie said that was correct.

Council Member Mossar clarified none of the LM zones near the Embarcadero
interchange were recommended for the zone.

Mr. Emslie said that was correct.

Council Member Mossar stated the recommendation from the P&TC only
approved the overlay zone on the east side of Highway 101.

Mr. Emslie said that was correct.

Council Member Mossar said the Council was provided with documents that
referred to in the staff report (CMR:134:06) and asked whether the draft
Site Assessment and Design Guidelines for Palo Alto Baylands Nature
Preserve was being used.

Mr. Emslie said the document was on hold.

Council Member Mossar said the P&TC talked about specific design controls
in the area recommended for the overlay. Staff was asked what the P&TC
referred to for guidance in appropriate development.

Mr. Emslie said the P&TC referred to the existing Baylands Master Plan which
was adopted and in effect.

Council Member Mossar asked whether there were design guidelines in the
Baylands Master Plan.

Mr. Emslie said there were no design guidelines, but the Baylands Master
Plan talked in general about the need for sensitive design that respected the
proximity of the Baylands as a natural environment. The purpose of the
draft guidelines was to prepare the guidelines anticipated in the current
Baylands Master Plan.

Council Member Mossar said her recollection was that the P&TC used
phrases such as “horizontal lines, not vertical lines,” and others that were
design guidelines in nature. The P&TC’s use of the phrases was confusing.
Staff was asked what the impact of the overlay decision would be on the
existing auto uses on Embarcadero Road.
