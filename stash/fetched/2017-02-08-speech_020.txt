Let me close tonight with gratitude—for the opportunity to serve as Mayor, for a chance

to join with so many others in serving this remarkable community, and for all those who

came before us.

Palo Alto’s deep roots will be tested by strong winds in the coming year—but as our

neighbor Stanford University proclaims on its official seal— “the wind of freedom blows.”

Freedom to engage, freedom to disagree and freedom to take a stand—for the common

good, with respect and with dignity for all.

Thank you for being here and I look forward to the important work that lies ahead.
