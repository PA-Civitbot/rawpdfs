CONSENT CALENDAR

Council Member Freeman referred to Item No. 2 and said she asked the City
Attorney’s Office to provide the annual cost in dollars for the City to
participate in the Santa Clara Valley Water Resources Protection
Collaborative.

Director of Public Works Glenn Roberts responded that the cost involved in
the City’s participation was restricted solely to staff time, which came out of
current resources. Staff estimated the project involved approximately 8
hours per month, 100 hours during a year, at a cost of $6,000 to $7,000
worth of staff time, including benefits.

Council Member Freeman clarified a Budget Amendment Ordinance would
not be required.
