I envision that this year we will rise to the challenge as a community to
develop a plan now for Cubberley that gives the School District flexibility
while creating a first rate community center in South Palo Alto. We must not
give in and kick the can down the road to some future Council while
Cubberley “rots in place.”

I also see Palo Alto creating true fiber to the premises with 1-gigabit
connection speeds, firmly establishing Palo Alto as the Leading Digital City of
the Future. This is the Year of the Future and the future is now.

I want to thank all of you for coming and take a moment to thank Tesla once
again for hosting, as well as City staff for all their hard work in putting this
event together. At this time I would also like to invite all of you to please
stay for the reception. We are pleased to feature refreshments from our
local businesses that have been kind enough to support tonight’s event.

Thank you
