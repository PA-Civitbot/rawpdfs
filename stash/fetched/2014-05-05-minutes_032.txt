Staff was searching for leadership group members with established networks
in the community. Staff would give more thought to the name of the group
as they drafted an application form.

Council Member Holman asked if Council Members could submit names for
the leadership group and, if so, what was the deadline.

Ms. Gitelman would provide information once an application form was
created and a deadline for applying was determined.

Mayor Shepherd asked if the Council was allowed to submit names.

Molly Stump, City Attorney, replied yes.
