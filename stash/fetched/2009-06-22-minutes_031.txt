type, you may be an employer of this person, but you are still not a
business.

Mayor Drekmeier reiterated this was on the basis of a FTE or a fraction
thereof.

Vice Mayor Morton agreed this was the case, otherwise there were too many
exemptions at all different levels.

Council Member Barton asked for clarification on the consultant status.

Ms. Silver clarified the proposed language included the distinction between
contractors/consultants working on the premises versus those doing discrete
activities off-site.

Council Member Barton reiterated this lent to looking at the 1099 employees
versus any reimbursable expenses.

Vice Mayor Morton noted that most dentists and other medical professions,
for retirement benefit purposes, had no true employees on site but made
use of contractors and subcontractors, which under the BLT per employee
headcount purposes would be considered as employees.
