Council Member Burt asked for pros and cons of seeking candidates within
California or this region instead of a national candidate pool.

Mr. Murray stated that was one of the most significant problems any city in
California faced when recruiting a City Manager. He asked to expand the
search to a market that was broader and deeper. The technical part of the
job could be learned and the real skill we were looking for was leadership in
management, the ability to work with the Council, community and the staff.

Council Member Morton asked whether the timeline was too aggressive.

Mr. Murray stated it was adequate time and the firm could donate the
resources to get the job done.

Council Member Kishimoto stated that most of his placements were in
California and the Western cities and asked him what networks he had and
in his experience in recruiting nationwide.

Mr. Murray stated that most of his clients were in the Western United States.
Their firm did have contacts in cities throughout the United States, but they
would start in this area and work their way out. Due to costs of living in Palo
Alto, they would need to look in the appropriate market.

Council Member Kishimoto asked if he anticipated any other problems.

Mr. Murray stated some problems were the cost of living and the challenge
of working with a nine-member council.

Council Member Schmid asked what unique attributes their firm would bring
to the search.

Mr. Murray stated their firm had a web-based applicant system and
database, which had information on candidates throughout the United
States.

Mayor Klein asked what his opinion was on an open process when
interviewing the finalists.

Mr. Murray stated that was an important process for college communities
and candidates should know that before hand.

Mayor Klein asked whether he thought we would lose candidates if that was
the process.
