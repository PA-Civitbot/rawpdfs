Council Member DuBois: Again, that's where a lot of the bike traffic is
today. I don't see school kids going from Loma Verde to the middle of
Ventura.

Mayor Burt: That's because you can't get across the tracks, Tom.

Council Member DuBois: Right. Where they end up going is over to East
Meadow to get to Gunn or to Terman.

Mayor Burt: I'll just say that's pretty self-evident that they aren't going
anyplace but East Meadow, because they can't get across the tracks any
other way.

Council Member DuBois: I'm very concerned about this eminent domain
that we'd essentially be (crosstalk).

Mayor Burt: I'm sorry. Staff already answered that we have a power
substation on the west side, and that's what their recommendation is.
Correct? On Loma Verde, we would ...

Mr. Mello: That would potentially allow us to avoid right-of-way acquisition,
if we were to use the substation. Yes.

Mayor Burt: I will offer a substitution to "B" which is to delete the portion
that says "at East Meadow Drive or." Which means that it will still have to
include potential trenching but would focus on Loma Verde.

Council Member Kniss: Are you going to suggest (inaudible) included?

Mayor Burt: If the maker of the Motion will accept it, sure.

Council Member Filseth: He's asking if the maker of the Motion will accept
it.

Council Member Kniss: I'll second it.

Mayor Burt: Seconded by Council Member Kniss. We need to then focus on
the Amendment. Does anyone feel a need to speak specifically to the
Amendment? Council Member Kniss.
