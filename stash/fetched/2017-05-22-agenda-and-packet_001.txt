   PUBLIC COMMENT
   Members of the public may speak to agendized items; up to three minutes per speaker, to be determined by the
   presiding officer. If you wish to address the Council on any issue that is on this agenda, please complete a speaker
   request card located on the table at the entrance to the Council Chambers, and deliver it to the City Clerk prior to
   discussion of the item. You are not required to give your name on the speaker card in order to speak to the
   Council, but it is very helpful.

   TIME ESTIMATES
   Time estimates are provided as part of the Council's effort to manage its time at Council meetings. Listed times
   are estimates only and are subject to change at any time, including while the meeting is in progress. The Council
   reserves the right to use more or less time on any item, to change the order of items and/or to continue items to
   another meeting. Particular items may be heard before or after the time estimated on the agenda. This may occur
   in order to best manage the time at a meeting or to adapt to the participation of the public. To ensure
   participation in a particular item, we suggest arriving at the beginning of the meeting and remaining until the item
   is called.

   HEARINGS REQUIRED BY LAW
   Applicants and/or appellants may have up to ten minutes at the outset of the public discussion to make their
   remarks and up to three minutes for concluding remarks after other members of the public have spoken.
