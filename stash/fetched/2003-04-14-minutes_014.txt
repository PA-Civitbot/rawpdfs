PUBLIC HEARINGS

Mayor Mossar announced that Item Nos. 11 and 12 would be heard
concurrently.

11.   Public Hearing: The City Council will consider a recommendation by the
      Planning and Transportation Commission to permanently adopt interim
      Ordinances No. 4689 and 4690, which expired on March 2, 2003, and
      may not be extended. These ordinances modified the Neighborhood
      Commercial (CN) District regulations for the Midtown Shopping District
      (portions of the 2600, 2700, and 2800 blocks of Middlefield Road, and
      700 blocks of Colorado Avenue, Moreno Avenue, and San Carlos Court)
      and the Charleston Center (portions of the 3900 block of Middlefield
      Road) to promote neighborhood-serving uses in those areas.

12.   Public Hearing: The City Council will consider the Extension of Ordinance
      No. 4781, which was passed March 3, 2003 on an interim basis. This
      ordinance prohibits ground floor office uses in the Midtown Shopping
      District (portions of the 2600, 2700, and 2800 blocks of Middlefield Road,
      and 700 blocks of Colorado Avenue, Moreno Avenue, and San Carlos
      Court) and the Charleston Center (portions of the 3900 block of
      Middlefield Road). The extension will be for a period of 10 months and 15
      days, or until a permanent ordinance for these areas is adopted,
      whichever is shorter.

Chief Planning Official Lisa Grote reviewed the project descriptions contained in
the staff reports (CMR:234:03 and CMR:227:03). She said the recommendation
was to introduce the permanent ordinance changes for both the Midtown and
Charleston Shopping Centers, which limited office use to a certain percentage in
the Charleston Shopping Center and to a certain size in the Midtown Shopping
Center. The second action was to continue the interim restrictions on any new
office in both the Charleston and Midtown Centers.

Mayor Mossar declared the Public Hearing open.
