assessment of determined high fire danger days by the Fire Chief differ from
the County and/or the State’s assessment.

Mr. Benest said the County would tend to have more high fire danger days
because they did them on a regional basis.

Vice Mayor Kishimoto asked whether the estimated $35,000 was an average
amount or the maximum.

Mr. Benest said the amount could rise as high as $100,000 if it was
seasonably dry and fire personnel were needed on a constant basis.

Vice Mayor Kishimoto asked whether $35,000 estimated 20 days a season,
even though the high fire danger season could run as long as 120 days.

Mr. Benest said that was correct.

Vice Mayor Kishimoto said the cost could run as high $200,000 for 120 days.

Mr. Benest said staff did not expect the cost to exceed more than $40,000.

Vice Mayor Kishimoto expressed support for staff’s proposal.

Mr. Benest said if the Council voted to approve staff’s proposal, a summary
report would be provided.

Council Member Barton expressed support for the Colleagues Memo. He
believed it was important for Council to be as prudent and forward-thinking
as possible.

Council Member Morton asked where the wild land unit was stationed.

Mr. Benest said it was located at Fire Station No. 8.

Council Member Morton clarified there was no guarantee of fire personnel
being there for 120 days unless conditions warranted it.

Mr. Benest said Fire Station No. 8 would be fully staffed with appropriate
staff and apparatus on those days the County indicated as high fire danger
days.

Council Member Morton asked whether it would be staffed without using
overtime.

Mr. Benest said no. It would be overtime.
