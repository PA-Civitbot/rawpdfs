Council Member Kniss felt the Recruitment Program was important.              Many
cities held recognition events for Board Members and Commissioners.

MOTION: Council Member Kniss moved, seconded by Vice Mayor Shepherd
to approve the Policy and Services Committee recommendations to adopt an
ordinance and Resolutions 9370 and 9371 (Attachment A) updating the
Boards and Commissions Recruitment Program by: 1) realigning Board and
Commission terms to match a biannual recruitment schedule with the
Human Relations Commission, Library Advisory Commission, Public Art
Commission, and Utilities Advisory Commission recruitments in April each
year and the Architectural Review Board, Historic Resources Board, Parks
and Recreation Commission, Planning and Transportation Commission, and
Storm Drain Oversight Committee recruitments in October of each year; 2)
allowing for midterm resignations to be reviewed by Council on a case by
case basis; 3) providing the City Clerk latitude on how to advertise in local
media; 4) directing the City Clerk to continuously accept applications
throughout the year; 5) encouraging Staff Liaisons and Commission
Members to commit to participation in the Boards and Commission
Recruitment Program; 6) directing the City Clerk to hold a trial volunteer fair
inclusive of all applicable City Government volunteer opportunities, with a
table for each Commission, hosted by the City in March 2014; and 7)
directing the City Clerk to begin hosting in 2013 an annual Boards and
Commissions Members recognition event.

Vice Mayor Shepherd believed revision of the Recruitment Program was long
overdue.

Council Member Holman hoped the changes would generate excitement for
recruitment.
