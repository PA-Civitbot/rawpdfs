Vice Mayor Shepherd felt Staff was following the steps suggested at the
FTTP conference in Kansas City. Mr. Fleming was familiar with many
cities' experiences with FTTP networks because of his background in cable.
Awareness of synergies between live events and internet broadcasts could
allow the Council to make better decisions. Advances in Wi-Fi were
occurring as well and would be critical for Council decisions.       FTTP
conferences were informative.

Council Member Schmid believed the excitement of possibilities was
missing.    It was important to understand the public benefits new
technology could provide. Perhaps the Advisory Committee could provide
a list of public benefits, ideas and possibilities and help define the
characteristics of the RFP process. The Advisory Committee should be
formed as soon as possible and discuss criteria, process and structure. He
asked if Staff check-ins with the Council were included in the work plan.

Mr. Keene indicated there were a number of decision points where Staff
would return to the Council.

Council Member Schmid believed check-ins would maintain momentum
and allow the sharing of information.

Mayor Scharff stated speed on Wi-Fi networks was important now that
personal hot spots could be created with smart phones.
