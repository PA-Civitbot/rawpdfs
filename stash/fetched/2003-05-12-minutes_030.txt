Mayor Mossar said it was Council action that put the spine of the building
into play.

Council Member Lytle said if the Council had professional assistance on the
historic renovation earlier in the process, it would have been understood
much earlier.

Mayor Mossar clarified if the Council had looked at the project in more detail
at the time the action was taken, the cost consequence might have been
understood.

Council Member Kishimoto expressed support for both parts of the motion.
