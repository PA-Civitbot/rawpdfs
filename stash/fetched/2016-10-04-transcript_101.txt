Mayor Burt: I'd encourage everyone, especially at this hour, to be focused.
Let's not ask extraneous questions nor make extraneous comments. Vice
Mayor Scharff.

Vice Mayor Scharff: Since we had discussions previously, can I just make a
Motion?

Mayor Burt:   We have a Public Hearing.     No, you can't.   Council Member
Wolbach.

Council Member Wolbach: I was going to ask the same question.

Mayor Burt: Any other questions? At this time, I will open the Public

Council Member Wolbach: Second.

MOTION: Vice Mayor Scharff moved, seconded by Council Member Wolbach

the California Environmental Quality Act.

Mayor Burt: Motion by Vice Mayor Scharff, second by Council Member
DuBois. Would you like—I'm sorry. Council Member Wolbach. Would you
