City Manager Benest said in the last five to seven years the increase in
spending was on libraries, traffic safety, planning, and disaster
preparedness. They were conscious decisions made for good reasons.

Council Member Ojakian referenced page 5.3 of the Report, and asked why
there was an increase in Planning Applications Completed and in the Average
Time for Completing Major Applications.

Ms. Harrison said it was based on the complexity of the application and
made reference to large projects that had taken place in the Stanford and
the SOFA areas.

Council Member Ojakian asked if it was possible to footnote one-time or
exceptional projects.

Ms. Erickson suggested using a measure to show the average time and show
the percentage achieved within a targeted timeframe, as footnotes.

Mr. Benest said Council had raised concerns regarding the time for
processing building permits. The data report indicated a great headway in
processing applications.

Ms. Erickson said there was a drastic reduction in the time for processing
building permits. More work needed to be done on the development review.
She felt it would be beneficial to take Council Member Ojakianâ€™s footnote
suggestion and investigate what caused the numbers to increase, or to show
the complexity or verify whether the majority of applications were processed
timely.

Council Member Ojakian referenced page 7.9 of the Report, under Refuse
Fund, the operating revenue was running better than the operating expense.
He asked the reason for the change in the past three years.

Ms. Erickson said it was appropriate to run down the reserves if there was
more than what was needed.
