Mr. Keene stated if the increased costs were paid by drawing down the
California Employers Retirees Benefit Trust (CERBT) it would increase our
future liability.

Council Member Klein asked for the amount of savings from the vacant
positions.

Mr. Ramberg stated he was unsure of the number at the present time.

Council Member Klein asked when the numbers would be expected.

Mr. Ramberg stated Staff could return with savings around the December
timeframe.

Council Member Espinosa asked how the forecasting would be calculated in
the future in order to come up with more accurate numbers.

Mr. Ramberg stated the PERS system used an actuarial assumption across
the board, which would not be changing; the future retiree numbers being
input into the system will be changed to 115 retirees in 2009.

Council Member Espinosa asked whether the retiree spike was sustained or
whether Staff felt the spike was over.

Mr. Ramberg stated Staff could revisit with the actuarial contact and
reinforce what was viewed as a large swing and see if there were steps that
should be taken.

Council Member Schmid stated the City was overestimating the short term
future liabilities in early retirement, and the 7.75 percent rate of return
assumption. He stated concerns with funding the shortfall from the General
Fund.

Mr. Ramberg stated Staff planned to return to Council towards the end of
the year with solution of how to return the funds.

Council Member Schmid stated if funds were drawn on CERBT plan assets is
increased liability.

Mr. Keene stated drawing on the plan assets would be the default position in
the absence of any other funds.
