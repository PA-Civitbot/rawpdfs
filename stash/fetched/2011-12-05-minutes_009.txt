Council Member Klein asked if Mr. Williams could urge this group to have
more balance in their committees.

Mr. Williams stated that would be a good idea.

Council Member Klein asked how ABAG determined the amount of new
housing allocations for the El Camino Real Corridor.

Mr. Williams indicated it was mostly from viewing maps and locations of
transit stations and major corridors.

Council Member Klein asked if ABAG had considered the impact on zoning.

Mr. Williams stated he felt the primary constraint on these analyses was
transportation.

Council Member Shepherd stated the peer review process was different from
what she had originally thought. She then suggested the process should go
back to committee for review. She expressed concern about the amount of
work to be done to accommodate housing numbers. She asked what kind of
control was lost by shifting the University Avenue and El Camino Real from a
GOA to a PDA.

Mr. Williams indicated that the implications were unclear with regard to
zoning.

Council Member Shepherd stated she would like to better understand the
importance of transportation funds and the need to match them to the
Comprehensive Plan. She stated she supported Item 1, but had concerns
about Items 2 and 3. She said she was hopeful they could explore more
scenarios for reducing greenhouse gases.

Council Member Scharff asked if the 2.45 percent figure had been frozen in
time.

Mr. Williams stated he was told the figure was pre-recession, which led him
to believe it was from 2005 or 2007. He suggested Staff needed more
information on what the figure represents.

Council Member Scharff asked if other cities were assigned a GOA if they did
not self-identify one, and if they then received housing assignments.
