Council Member Schmid asked if Staff was collecting baseline data and if
there would be anything further. He was concerned that there were ranges
of options for survey data, traffic data, and parking data. The Council
should determine which options were most appropriate to measure changes
and impacts of changes.

Ms. Gitelman advised that Staff grappled with how to characterize traffic
conditions given the State was moving away from LOS. Staff included travel
time estimates along a few routes, vehicle miles traveled, and other metrics.
The Council would want to add things to these data sets, but Staff attempted
to gather data that would be necessary to conduct a defensible EIR analysis.

Council Member Schmid inquired whether baseline data would consider the
addition of 2 million square feet of nonresidential space in the Palo Alto
sphere of influence.

Ms. Gitelman reported baseline data would not provide an analysis of
impacts or a look forward. Staff could provide data regarding historic
growth trends in the City and a characterization of existing development
including pipeline projects.

Council Member Schmid remarked that the new Stanford Hospital and the
business park would have a tremendous impact. He asked if Staff would be
explicit in the data.

Ms. Gitelman would provide the baseline data gathered in the last several
months.
