1.    Public Hearing: Consider Changes to the 2007-08 Water Utility Rates,
      Including the Adoption of Monthly Customer Charges

      Resolution 8717 entitled “Resolution of the Council of the City of Palo
      Alto Amending Utility Rate Schedules W-1, W-2, W-4, and W-7 of the
      City of Palo Alto Utilities Rates and Charges Pertaining to Water Rates”

Utilities Director Valerie Fong stated costs and expected revenue are
assessed annually. There were three primary cost drivers; sales levels,
wholesale water costs, and operations and maintenance. Customers are
charged on a per unit basis to recover costs. There had been an endeavor to
inform the customers of the utility rate increase through the utility bill
inserts, the utility community announcement, the City Manager’s weekly
memo, and the City website.

Council Member Kleinberg asked what type of customer utilized a 3 to 8 inch
meter.

Ms. Fong replied it was for commercial customers.

Council Member Drekmeier asked whether the City had looked into reading
water meters remotely to reduce costs.

Ms. Fong stated there was currently a pilot program in progress.

Council Member Barton asked for clarification on meter fees.

Ms. Fong stated the meter fees were designed to capture the individual
customers’ usage.

Vice Mayor Klein mentioned the fixed rate charge had been in place until a
few years ago.

Ms. Fong stated that was correct.

Vice Mayor Klein asked why the rate schedule had changed.

Ms. Fong stated the thought was to increase sales by volume of growth,
which did not materialize.
