trusts; retiree medical and pension. On the pension side the Chief Actuary
Officer recommended that the assumed rate of return be decreased from
7.75 to 7.25 percent. The Board decided on 7.5. This was the rate that
CalPERS Staff would use on an ongoing basis beginning in March for
evaluations that would be prepared in October ending on June 30, 2012.
The recommendation before Council was to go from 7.25 to 7.61 starting in
the next fiscal year. The impacts to 2012 were incorporated in the mid-
year. They incorporated the Finance Committee recommendations 1-3 in
the midyear. Those were the only the items that impacted 2011-12, which
was the $900,000 of which $600,000 was for the General Fund.

Council Member Shepherd explained that the bulk of the Finance
Committee’s conversation rested on Packet Page 449 and 450. She said
that Mr. Perez had explained that if they looked at the major caveats that
they might forfeit some of the City’s great bond ratings and that they would
be dipping into a more risky opportunity to try to reduce the actuarial.
Based on those facts, the Finance Committee stayed with the first three
items. With respect to Item No. 4, the discount rate was a decision they
would make in the next year and did not affect the books that were closing
in June 2012. She thought everything else was straightforward and directed
Council to look at Page 449. The area on the left showed the actuarial
methodologies that had been used and picked up by Milliman two years
prior. The right side showed Mr. Bartel’s changes. Returning to the Milliman
methodology reduced the actuarial by about $900,000.

MOTION: Council Member Shepherd moved, seconded by Vice Mayor
Scharff to: 1) accept the retiree medical actuarial study with changes to
amortization method, asset smoothing, and actuarial load, but keeping the
7.75 discount rate assumption in 2012, and 2) for fiscal year 2013 accept all
Finance Committee recommended changes, including the discount rate
changing from 7.25 to 7.61 percent to match the highest CalPERS discount
rate option.

Vice Mayor Scharff thought the rising cost of the ARC was a concern to
everyone. Even with the changes they were still putting more money into
the ARC than they had the previous year. He asked if that was correct.

Mr. Perez answered yes.

Vice Mayor Scharff said the actuarial studies were a snapshot in time of what
they were thinking of at that point. What they were thinking before when
they fully funded the ARC was less. If they had used the more current
assumptions then they would have actually put in more money the previous
year. He said that it also depended on the concessions obtained from the
                                                                            Page 7 of 28
