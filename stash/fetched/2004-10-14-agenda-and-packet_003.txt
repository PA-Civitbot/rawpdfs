Council Member Morton disagreed with the necessity of the facilitator’s
interview with individual Council Members regarding the CAOs. He
stated he would rather meet individually with the CAOs.

Chair Mossar confirmed the full Council would meet with each
individual CAO.

Mr. Shannon stated the interview process would allow the facilitator to
gather information from each Council Member and prepare a summary
evaluation, which would serve as the basis for Council’s decision, and
he thought the interview would be preferred over filling out a form.

Mayor Beecham said the purpose of the process is to develop a
consensus evaluation by the Council for each CAO.

Council Member Morton pointed out the Council would provide the
consensus and not the facilitator.

Vice Mayor Burch stated the process would be followed at this time,
and possibly some steps could be eliminated in the future.

MOTION: Chair Mossar moved, Vice Mayor Burch seconded, to
accept the draft CAO Performance Evaluation System Procedures,
Work Plan and Process and direct the facilitator to set the wheels in
motion.

MOTION PASSED          6-0

ADJOURNMENT: The meeting adjourned at 6:05 p.m.
