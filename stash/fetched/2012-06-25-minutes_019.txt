Council Member Holman inquired if it could be referred to the Public Art
Commission.

Ms. French indicated it was located on private property, and Staff did not
send private art to the Public Art Commission.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER that the Architectural Review Board subcommittee
review the design for the project regarding the fountain.

Council Member Holman said the fountain did not follow the design of the
building.

Council Member Schmid felt different perspectives would be useful.

Vice Mayor Scharff inquired whether the ARB had reviewed and approved
the fountain.

Ms. French answered yes. The design was displayed for the ARB.

Vice Mayor Scharff commented that the Council, as policy, did not question
an Art Commission decision, and the same policy should apply to the ARB.
The applicant should make the decision.

Council Member Burt inquired whether the Council had a policy addressing
art located immediately adjacent to a public street.

Mr. Williams reported the Council did not have such a policy, unless the art
was part of a PC benefit. The ARB could review that as part of the private
development.

Council Member Burt assumed the ARB approved the fountain in concept,
and supported the Amendment with the understanding that the ARB would
not prescribe an art piece. He asked if that was the intention of the
Amendment.

Council Member Holman stated her Incorporated change was for the ARB to
consider a different design.

Council Member Burt suggested the Incorporated change should be changed
from consider a different design to review the design.
