     DISCUSSION:
     All development, including construction activities, must comply with the City’s Noise Ordinance
     (PAMC Chapter 9.10), which restricts the timing and overall noise levels associated with construction
     activity. Short-term temporary construction noise that complies with the Noise Ordinance would result
     in impacts that are expected to be less than significant. The project is located in busy commercial
     district with an active train station in the immediate vicinity; the existing noise conditions are not quiet
     and the temporary construction activities will not create any new significant noise impacts.

     DISCUSSION:
     The proposed project includes improvements within the public right of way (sidewalk and road) of a
     fully developed commercial area and does not encourage development and therefore will not create any
     new population and housing impacts.
