Vice Mayor Beecham said none of his NCPA colleagues indicated they would
be on the verge of doing the same type of action.

Council Member Morton clarified the City was liable for costs incurred, and
the City could not unilaterally make the decision to give notice the City did
not wish to be liable for future costs.

Mr. Calonne said the City would make the argument for costs not yet
incurred.

Council Member Kishimoto understood Palo Alto could decide whether it
wanted to spend money and participate in various parts of NCPA.

Mr. Ulrich said the City had input into the budget and could make decisions
on spending money.

Council Member Kishimoto asked how the voting was weighted.

Vice Mayor Beecham said on most general issues, the vote was simple
majority. Certain projects required a roll call for those who participated in
the project. There was a procedure where there was voting according to how
much one participated in a project.

Mayor Mossar questioned the status relative to the claim on power
generation if the City withdrew from the lawsuit.

Mr. Ulrich did not believe there was any impact.

Mayor Mossar said if the City withdrew from the lawsuit, the City would have
no rights of input or participation in the ultimate decision.

Mr. Ulrich said that was correct. The City paid to be a member of the process
that had an opportunity to voice an opinion and work with the other team
members towards an appropriate solution.

Mayor Mossar said NCPA was a sophisticated, complex organization. She
understood the cohesion of the group and asked whether the City’s action to
withdraw from NCPA’s decision on the matter would be potentially
problematic.

Mr. Ulrich said he attended meetings and noticed that decisions that were
made were looked at as in the best interest of the entire NCPA, as opposed
to one member voting in his/her best interest.
