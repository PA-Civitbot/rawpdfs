Council Member Kishimoto stated that was correct, with this being the staff’s
estimate of a net economic cost of 1.3 million dollars and an estimated
saving of 1.8 million dollars.

Mayor Klein asked if Attachment A referred to the first 13 items.

Ms. Nagel clarified Attachment A included items 1 through 13, but the
backside (page 2) also included increasing Palo Alto’s green subscription of 5
percent or 10 percent.

Mr. Benest stated there needed to be detailed budget discussions because
the City cannot afford one million dollars from the General Fund. He stated
there are still further questions which they would report on in September. He
stressed the razor-thin surplus in the General Fund which made further
budget talks necessary.

Council Member Kishimoto spoke on carbon offsets for employee business
travel in that it could be overcome by asking staff for continued research.

Mayor Klein stated he thought buying offsets was an easy way out.

Council Member Kishimoto stated parking cash-outs were controversial but
crucial.

AMENDMENT: Council Member Burt moved, seconded by Council Member
Barton that Staff return in early September 2008 with proposal of items to
be implemented in the short term and a plan for additional analysis for items
in sub-grouping tentatively listed as net city cost of under 50 dollars per ton.

Council Member Burt stressed moving both aggressively and effectively.

Council Member Barton concurred with Council Member Burt and hesitated to
commit to 1.3 million dollars from the General Fund without further
discussion.

Vice Mayor Drekmeier stated support of the Amendment, though he
expressed concerns about CEAP. He did not support carbon offsets and
parking cash-outs, but supported looking at the Calaveras Fund for funding.

Council Member Morton asked for clarification on what the difference was
between the original Motion and the Amendment.
