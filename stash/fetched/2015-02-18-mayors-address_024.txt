             light your way,

             pave your path,

             open your heart,

             how much that has meant to you.



Slide Kindness is contagious. Practice it.

Understanding is a byproduct of it. Equality comes from it.

How we address each other in the community, young or old, teen or senior or in between,
I think has a lot to do with how we move forward as a community.



This year watch for these and more events.

Make a Difference Day is celebrated this year on October 24, 2015. It is celebrated
each year on the fourth Saturday in October. Make a Difference Day is the largest
national day of community service and is a celebration of neighbors helping neighbors.
The event was created by USA WEEKEND magazine in 1992. We have not really been
active in this day of service. I’m looking forward to working with Youth Community
Services and Lief Ericson to make it a great FIRST day for Palo Alto.

Look forward also to an invigorated May Fete Parade. Older than Macy’s Thanksgiving
Day Parade, we are looking to re-energize the parade with an expanded route,
increased participation and audience and some surprises. I hope you will join us and
enjoy this year’s May Fete Parade.

And something I know others before me have wanted to do and hopefully we can
accomplish this year is creating an event to Honor our Vets. I’m sure none of us wish
for any of our sons, daughters, fathers, brothers to go to war. Our firefighters already
honor Blue Star Mothers, and we are looking to put together an event giving the
community the opportunity to personally thank veterans for their service and sacrifice.
And in some cases it has been great. I look forward to working with Chief Nickel on
such a program.
