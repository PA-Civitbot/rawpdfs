ORAL COMMUNICATIONS

Stephanie Munoz spoke regarding budget cuts affecting health benefits.
Health insurance should be a right which is why the wages for health
benefits were not taxable. She felt spending the budgetary cuts from
employeeâ€™s health benefits to hire a communications person was not a
benefit to the employees.
