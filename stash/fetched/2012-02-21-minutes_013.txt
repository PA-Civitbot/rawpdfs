noticed that around it was a number of other PFs which were parking. He
asked if the City owned those parking lots.

Mr. Williams replied yes.

Council Member Schmid asked if the City had options along with this
property or neighboring properties.

Mr. Williams answered correct.

Council Member Schmid noted that the City was currently paying parking
assessments, which were quite substantial. He asked what that amount
was.

Mr. Williams replied the site was assessed for 28 parking spaces with an
assessment of $140,000, and the City of Palo Alto paid that.

Council Member Schmid asked if it was paid each year or a one-time
payment.

Mr. Williams thought it was either paid at one time or paid over a number
of years, but the City was not paying it currently.

Council Member Schmid inquired if the City would be reimbursed if the
property was transferred. He asked if the parking was being sold along
with the property.

Mr. Williams indicated the parking did go along with the property, to the
extent that there were discretionary approvals associated with that. He
indicated they could have a discussion about recouping the cost of that
assessment or buying into the Parking District.

Council Member Schmid thought there were annual assessments for the
Parking District.

Mr. Williams stated he would have to check. He thought some property
owners had paid upfront and in some instances the City had done that.

Council Member Schmid stated any private party that bought the property
would have to understand the relationship to the parking assessment and
whether that continued or not and whether there was an obligation on it.

Mr. Williams replied yes.
