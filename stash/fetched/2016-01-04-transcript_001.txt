Special Orders of the Day

1.    Election of Mayor for 2016.

Mayor Holman: As you all know, the order of the business this evening is
the election of the Mayor and Vice Mayor. First I'll call for nominations for
the Mayor. Anyone can nominate a nominee for the Mayor. It does not
require a second. A person can also nominate themselves. After that, the
person who's making the nomination can speak to the nomination. The
person being nominated can also speak. Any other Council Members can
also comment. Members of the public will also be heard. If a member of
the public wants to speak to a nomination of a Mayor or Vice Mayor, please
fill out a card and send it to the Clerk over here to my left. With that, I have
a light from Council Member Filseth.

Council Member Filseth: Thank you very much and happy new year. I'd like
to nominate Greg Schmid for Mayor. Going into his eighth year on Council,
Greg has amassed a huge amount of experience, which will serve the
community well.

Mayor Holman:      Council Member Filseth, I think, let's hear all the
nominations, and then we'll come back to you, if we could. I appreciate the
enthusiasm though.

NOMINATION: Council Member Filseth nominated Council Member Schmid
for Mayor for 2016.

Mayor Holman: Council Member Kniss.
