                                MINUTES
Council Member Berman would support the Motion; however, he had many
questions regarding financing, public outreach, and environmental issues.
He agreed with Council Member Klein's concerns regarding the State's water
supply.

Council Member Klein explained the water contract with San Francisco
involved a lawsuit from many years ago. The contractual water allocation
from San Francisco only applied if water was available. The amount of water
available for distribution was also dependent on relicensing of the Don Pedro
Dam. The Motion was to perform a study, and that was the logical next
step.

Council Member Kniss inquired about the number of votes needed for the
Motion to pass as only six Council Members were present.

Mayor Scharff indicated five votes were needed to pass the Motion.

MOTION FAILED: 4-2 Holman, Scharff, no, Burt, Schmid, Shepherd absent

Council Member Klein asked the City Attorney to explain why five votes were
necessary to pass the Motion.

Grant Kolling, Senior Assistant City Attorney, explained the City Charter
required an affirmative vote of a majority of the Council to approve an
award of a contract.

MOTION: Council Member Klein moved, seconded by Council Member
Berman to continue this item to the Council meeting of April 8, 2013.

MOTION PASSED:         4-2 Holman, Scharff, no, Burt, Schmid, Shepherd
absent

Council Member Klein suggested the Council urge absent Colleagues to
review the video recording in order not to repeat tonight's discussion.

Mayor Scharff requested the City Clerk notify absent Colleagues by email to
review the video recording of the meeting.
