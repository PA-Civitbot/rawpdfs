Council Member Cordell said it should be explicit that a noticed revocation
hearing would apply every time. She would refer to staff as to when those
should be adopted.

Mr. Emslie said if adopted that evening, it would be 30 days from that date.

Council Member Cordell said she wanted it to be explicit to make sure the
community was aware.

Mayor Beecham asked whether she was including staff’s recommendations
on #7 and #2.

Council Member Cordell confirmed.

Council Member Kleinberg asked about the process.

Mayor Beecham said Council Member Cordell was of the opinion there
needed to be wording changes made, but she did not include it in her
motion. He asked whether Council Member Kleinberg had a suggestion.

Council Member Kleinberg said she did not.        She asked about Council
Member Cordell’s request to make changes.

Mr. Emslie said staff suggested a replacement condition to the paragraph to
require periodic inspections by the City to verify that food was being
provided.

Council Member Cordell said that required staff to visit Antonio’s Nut House
late in the evening.

Council Member Kleinberg said she felt the hours should be reduced on
Sunday nights. She asked what legal record would support Antonio’s Nut
House being treated differently from other establishments open at two
o’clock in the morning.

Commissioner Holman said the majority opinion was the hours could remain
as they were because there was another establishment a couple of blocks
away with later hours. There was a State law that required food service with
alcohol service.

Council Member Kleinberg said the heart of the discussion was the late
hours. She wanted to hear from staff the legal restrictions encountered
when Antonio’s Nut House was being treated differently from other
establishments in the City.
