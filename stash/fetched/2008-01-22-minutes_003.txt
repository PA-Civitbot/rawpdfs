STUDY SESSION

1.    Opportunity to Replace & Enhance Cubberley Facilities

City Manager Frank Benest presented a Foothill De Anza Community College
District proposal for an “Opportunity to replace and enhance the Cubberley
Facility”. The proposal is to replace the dilapidated facilities on the City
owned 8 acre portion of the Cubberley site with a 98,000 square feet long-
term or permanent state-of-the-art education center. The new 2-story
education center would provide education programs geared toward students
desiring college skills, career pathways and life-long learning. The center
would include public meeting space, dance studios, artist programming and
child development program space. Future key issues that will need to be
addressed would include public outreach, maintaining community uses,
possible phasing and transition planning for existing tenants, parking and
circulation, traffic, green building standards and overall appearance. District
Chancellor Dr. Martha Kanter, also spoke promoting the proposal.
