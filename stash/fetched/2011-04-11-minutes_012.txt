Mr. Bobel stated Staff was aware of the position taken by the Sierra Club on
high temperature conversion technologies. They noted a variety of reasons
as to why high temperature conversion technologies were not good
resources.

Council Member Klein stated if Staff was assembling data, the information
the Sierra Club had in opposition of the high temperature conversion
technologies would be important data.

Council Member Holman asked about the reliability of the grant assumptions
in terms of funding.

Mr. Bobel stated most projects which previously had gone before Council
involved some sort of grant funding. He noted grant funding was an
unreliable source.

Council Member Holman stated concern about depending on an unreliable
funding source.

Mr. Sartor stated the Consultant had built grant scenarios into the model
ranging up to 50 percent of the cost of the new facility. Since Staff had
reviewed the Council comments, they had regrouped with the Consultant
and the plan was to reduce the grant assumptions to a 20 to 25 percent
range.

Council Member Holman stated she was interested in knowing the true cost
for the project.

Mr. Sartor stated the Consultant working with the City advised that a grant
assumption to cover 20 to 25 percent was attainable.

Council Member Holman asked if vendors considered the fact that Palo Alto
had been moving towards more native plantings; therefore, the yard waste
should be reduced.

Mr. Bobel stated there had not been adequate evidence of the reduction in
yard waste over the past several years.

Council Member Holman stated the Native Plantings Program had merely
been at the forefront over the past couple of years.

Mr. Bobel stated Staff had no basis on which to prepare a different estimate
for the amount of yard waste.

Council Member Holman stated she was unclear as to what was being asked
of Council from Staff.
