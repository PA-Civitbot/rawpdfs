Mr. Keene indicated the Council could give Staff general direction without a
particular timeframe. Staff would have to work on the outreach process. At
a later time, Staff could provide specific recommendations.

INTER-GOVERNMENTAL LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS

14.   Discussion and Direction to City Manager Regarding City of Palo Alto
      Response to the FAA Draft Environmental Assessment (EA) Regarding
      the Northern California Optimization of Airspace and Procedures in the
      Metroplex (NorCal OAPM).

James Keene, City Manager, reported Staff wanted to share the issue with
the Council in case the Council wished to submit a letter to the Federal
Aviation Administration (FAA).

Andrew Swanson, Airport Manager, indicated comments were limited to the
Metroplex Environmental Assessment (EA). Staff questioned the lack of
altitudes in the EA. The FAA felt extra information was not necessary and
the document met requirements. The impacts of the report were difficult to
understand because altitudes were missing and noise contours resembled
flight paths. The FAA modeled noise impacts under conditions of tower staff
handling aircraft.

Mr. Keene advised the EA was unrelated to the Surf Air issue. Apparently
airports around the country were attempting to move more airplanes in and
out of airports more efficiently. Flight paths did not appear to be changing
in ways that would be problematic for Palo Alto.
