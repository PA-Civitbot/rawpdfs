COUNCIL MEMBER QUESTIONS, COMMENTS AND ANNOUNCEMENTS

Council Member Burt was interested in referring soft-story and unreinforced
masonry buildings to the Policy and Services Committee. He asked if the
Council could make that referral at the current time.

Molly Stump, City Attorney, advised that the City Manager could refer the
matter to the Policy and Services Committee.

Lalo Perez, Acting City Manager, agreed to refer the matter to the Policy and
Services Committee.

Council Member Burt requested the referral include an update to the
inventory of soft-story and unreinforced masonry buildings; methods for
prioritizing buildings by risk; best practices utilized in other cities to enforce
upgrades; a summary of existing retrofit programs and incentives; and
recommendations for State legislation to support initiatives.

Council Member Scharff concurred with the referral.

Council Member Klein requested the referral also include financing options
for owners to perform necessary upgrades and rehabilitation and whether a
mandatory program would be sensible.

Council Member Holman felt it would be more appropriate to refer the item
to the Architectural Review Board (ARB) prior to the Policy and Services
Committee.

Vice Mayor Kniss attended the Midtown Association Ice Cream Social the
prior Sunday. Staff from virtually all City Departments were present. It was
a pleasant event for the entire family.

The City Council adjourned into the Closed Session at 10:56 P.M.
