the Development Cap Study area.

17.   Public Hearing: Adoption of a Resolution 9333 entitled “Resolution of
      the Council of the City of Palo Alto Approving the Proposed Fiscal Year
      2014 Community Development Block Grant Funding Allocations and
      the Draft 2014 Action Plan.”

Consuelo Hernandez, Planner, presented the Community Development Block
Grant (CDBG) allocations for Fiscal Year (FY) 2014. Palo Alto received funds
under the CDBG program to fund a variety of activities benefiting primarily
low- and moderate-income residents. Over the past few years, Palo Alto
received approximately $700,000 annually in entitlement grants. Funding
declined 17 percent in FY 2012 and 29 percent in FY 2013, with a proposed
reduction of 8.2 percent in FY 2014. Once Staff received the final allocation,
they would adjust allocations as necessary. Pursuant to the statutory
spending cap on public service activities, the maximum amount available
was $76,662. Staff proposed funding for five public service activities: Palo
Alto Housing Corporation, Catholic Charities, InnVision Shelter Network,
YWCA Support Network, and Silicon Valley Independent Living Center.
Pursuant to the statutory spending cap on planning and administration costs,
Staff requested the maximum amount of $91,342 to reimburse CDBG
administrative expenses and to fund fair housing services. For FY 2014,
Staff proposed funding of $398,753 for a Pilot Microenterprise Assistance
Program and a Workforce Development Program. The Finance Committee
reviewed and voted unanimously to fund these allocations on April 16, 2013.

Public Hearing Opened at 9:36 P.M.

Ann Marquant, Executive Director of Project Sentinel, appreciated Staff's
recommendation to fund Project Sentinel. She was available to answer
questions.
