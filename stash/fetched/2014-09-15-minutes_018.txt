10.   PUBLIC HEARING: 405 Curtner Condominium Map. Approval of a
      Tentative Map to Subdivide One Parcel Totaling 12,375 Square Feet
      Into Six Condominium Units Within the RM-30 Zone District located at
      405 Curtner Avenue. The six-unit development on this site was
      approved on October 29, 2013 and the Planning and Transportation
      Commission unanimously recommend map approval allowing the
      approved units to be sold rather than rented.       Environmental
      Assessment:     Categorically exempt from the provisions of the
      California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) per CEQA Guidelines
      Sections 15303 and 15061(b)(3).

Hillary Gitelman, Planning and Community Environment Director, reported
the matter was a tentative map that, if approved, would allow a six-unit
building to be sold as condominiums. Finding 5 referred to a mitigation
measure related to nesting birds. It should refer to conditions of approval
regarding preservation of oak trees. Staff requested the Council consider
approval of the map pursuant to the Subdivision Map Act and related
sections of the Palo Alto Municipal Code. The Planning and Transportation
Commission (PTC) unanimously recommended approval based on findings in
Attachment A.

Mayor Shepherd inquired whether the Applicant was entitled to 3 minutes or
10 minutes for comment.

Molly Stump, City Attorney, did not believe the Applicant would need 10
minutes.

Public Hearing opened at 10:44 P.M.

Salvatore Caruso, Applicant, requested the Council approve the item. The
Project complied with standards. The Project would be appropriate for
young families.

Public Hearing closed at 10:45 P.M.

Council Member Holman requested clarification of the correction to Finding
5.
