Council Member Burt stated the answer was not going to alter his vote it was
more for informational purposes.

Commissionsâ€™ main discussions had been over driveway entries.

Mr. Williams stated yes.

Council Member Schmid stated a portion of the Planning and Transportation
Commission discussion was a trade of property to allow the ingress and
egress on the same side.

Mr. Williams stated the property trade would minimize the necessary number
of driveways on the site.

Mr. Tuma stated the P&TC was looking into the opportunity as a more logical
ingress and egress with the property being under one ownership. He stated
the owner of the property was eager to negotiate an agreement without
trading land.

Council Member Schmid asked whether there would be further discussions to
solidify the concerns as the project proceeded.

Mr. Williams stated yes.

Mayor Klein asked for clarification on the staff report in regards to City
owned property surrounding the site in question.

attachment to the Negative Declaration describing the lot with a map.

Public Hearing opened at 8:21 p.m.
