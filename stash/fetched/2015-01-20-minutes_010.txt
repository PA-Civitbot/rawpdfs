He was also impressed by the use of technology to obtain data. He inquired
whether Staff had any plans to encourage cyclists to utilize bike lanes rather
than sidewalks.

Mr. Rodriguez explained that the Vehicle Code was contradictory in stating
that cyclists 12 years old and younger were allowed to ride on sidewalks and
that cyclists over 12 years of age could ride on sidewalks if they were
uncomfortable riding in the street. Staff had been experimenting with
different types of messages to encourage cyclists to walk their bikes on
sidewalks.     Giving cyclists an alternative to riding on sidewalks was
important.

Council Member Berman agreed the Vehicle Code was ambiguous. He asked
if experimental materials were provided free of charge to the City.

Mr. Rodriguez answered yes. The City paid for the cost of traffic control to
deploy materials.

Council Member Berman felt the projects would provide positive impacts.

Mayor Holman was pleased Staff was experimenting with improvements.
She asked if Concept Plan Lines would be presented to the Parks and
Recreation Commission.

Mr. Rodriguez reported Staff would present select projects to the Parks and
Recreation Commission in an effort to streamline the outreach process. The
Parks and Recreation Commission had supported the Plan overall and
provided a great deal of input to the Plan.

Mayor Holman asked if the green color of sharrows was universal or if the
community could provide input.

Mr. Rodriguez advised that the color complied with Federal Highway
Administration standards. A different shade or color could be used if the
community and the Council preferred.

Rob Robinson indicated the packs of bicyclists were regulated by train traffic.
Park Street carried 50 percent more bicycle traffic than Bryant Street. The
bicycle counts were amazing.
