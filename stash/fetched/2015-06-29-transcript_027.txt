Cara Silver, Senior Assistant City Attorney: Cara Silver, Senior Assistant
City Attorney. I also have our special telecommunications counsel, Tim Lay
of Spiegel and McDiarmid, here. He will be available to answer any technical
questions. He's assisted us with telecommunications law for the past 20
years as this is a specialized field. By way of background, Palo Alto is
continuing to experience requests for wireless communication facilities.
Most of these requests are not fill-in gap coverage, but to respond to the
need for faster and more data. Given that we have multiple requests, there
is a body of Federal and State law that unfortunately limits the City's ability
to regulate in this area. We've discussed this in different contexts, primarily
in connection with Housing Element law, but it is also very common in
telecommunications law where both Federal and State laws preempt the
City's ability to regulate. There are a series of Federal regulations. We have
the Telecommunications Act of 1996. We have the 2009 FCC shot clock
regulation. We have the Spectrum Act and the 2015 FCC Spectrum Act
                                                                         Page 27 of 67
