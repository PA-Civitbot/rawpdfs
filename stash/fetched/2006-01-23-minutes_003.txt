participants must be in compliance with all regulations and meet program
standards for conserving resources, preventing pollution and minimizing
waste. The City thanked the newest businesses that demonstrated their
environmental stewardship. Agilent had installed 4,000 T-5 and T-8 lamps,
60 low flow aerators, 19 low flow shower heads, and modified the existing
irrigation to include drip irrigation. Gunn High School had installed solar
panels on the roof of the science building, collected old electronics and cell
phones for recycling, and kept their grass clippings on the lawn for compost.
At Roche-Palo Alto, 90 percent of the van motors used variable frequency
drives, 70 percent of the roofs were upgraded to white roofing to save
energy, and they installed water-efficient groundcover instead of turf.

No action required.
