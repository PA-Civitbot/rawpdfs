Mr. Baum said the contracts would expire on December 14, 2005.          Five
votes were required to extend the contracts.

Mr. Heitzman said the Internet Service Provider contract (ISP) and the
Customer Service Provider contract would expire in December.

Council Member Freeman asked whether it would cost staff time and effort
to extend through January 2006.

Mr. Heitzman said staff could extend month-to-month, but did not know
whether there were legally ramifications.

Ms. Harrison said there was a legal concern but no administrative issues for
continuance.

Council Member Freeman asked what the legal issue was.

Senior Assistant City Attorney Grant Kolling said the City could not make a
unilateral decision. The City needed to return to Motorola and the ISP for
permission to extend.

Council Member Freeman asked if it could be investigated.

Mr. Kolling said yes.

Council Member Cordell asked whether the Councilâ€™s vote was needed to
authorize negotiation to extend the contracts and how many votes were
required.

Mr. Baum said he was unfamiliar with the contract. According to the City
Charter, five votes were required to extend a contract. He understood
Motorola had issues and wanted to terminate the contract.

Council Member Freeman asked if the staff working on the project was
sufficiently trained to take on the RFP process or should it have been
contracted out to professionals.

Mr. Yeats said based on the type of service level, staff would be comfortable
in getting a data service network but needed assistance in completing a full
RFP or a mix of services. Staff was familiar with cable issues but needed
assistance in the area of wireless systems.
