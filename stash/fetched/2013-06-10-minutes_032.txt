Council Member Price also felt strongly about holding a Retreat as soon as
possible.

Mayor Scharff reported the current meeting could not have started prior to
7:00 P.M., because the Public Hearing was noticed for 7:00 P.M.

MOTION PASSED: 9-0

Mr. Keene said that Staff recommended moving Agenda Item Number 15 to
Thursday, June 13, 2013 per the At Places Memo which documented
changes to the assessment roll. These changes were made after the packet
was printed with the Public Hearing date because of an input error in the
assessment software. One parcel owner did not receive proper notification
so continuing the item until Thursday will allow Staff time to notify the
owner.

MOTION: Council Member Klein moved seconded by Council Member
Berman to move Agenda Item Number 15 “Public Hearing – Assessment for
California Avenue Area Parking Bonds - Plan G: FY 2013-2014; Adoption of a
Resolution Confirming Engineer’s Report and Assessment Roll, California
Avenue Parking Project No. 92- 13 (For Fiscal Year 2013-2014)” to
