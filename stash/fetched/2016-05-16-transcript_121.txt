that on top of the—couple that with the 2,720, we're probably at 3,500
there. Third and maybe most important, if we put the housing number the
same as Scenario 2, I actually don't see any more value in Scenario 2. I
don't see a lot of value in Scenario 2 without sustainability and
transportation. It could almost replace Scenario 2, and we wouldn't have to

Mayor Burt: I won't accept it principally because the housing in Scenarios 1
and 2 are below what our RHNA numbers are going to be. I'm just not sure
what the point is even in looking at that. Frankly, I don't think it meets the

Council Member Filseth: One and two are sort of the extrapolation of

AMENDMENT:      Council Member Filseth moved, seconded by Council
Member XX to add to the Motion Part A, “including 7,220 housing units.”

AMENDMENT WITHDRAWN BY THE MAKER

MOTION RESTATED: Mayor Burt moved, seconded by Vice Mayor Scharff
to direct Staff to evaluate two variations of Scenario Number 5 including a
performance based approach with policies and mitigation measures to limit
the impacts of growth and other quality of life issues. Both Scenarios would
include Staff recommended Sustainability and Climate Action Plan (S/CAP)
elements:

A.         Option A from the Staff Report; and

B.         Option C from the Staff Report, incorporating 6,000 housing units; and

C.         Approve Amendment Number 5 to Contract Number C08125506 with
           PlaceWorks to add $423,814 for a total not to exceed $2,801,157 for
           completion of the Comprehensive Plan Update and associated EIR; and

D.         Amend the Fiscal Year 2016 Budget Appropriation Ordinance for the
           General Fund by:

     i.         Increasing  the  Planning    and   Community        Environment
                Department appropriation by $356,140; and

     ii.        Decreasing the Budget Stabilization Reserve by $423,814.

Mayor Burt: Please vote on the board.             That passes 7-2 with Council
Members Schmid and Holman voting no.              We have concluded this item.
