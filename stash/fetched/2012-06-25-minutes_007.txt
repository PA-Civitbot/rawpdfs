underground garage in the contaminated area, placing the building on a
podium, and reducing the scale of the building.

Council Member Burt asked if the Council had the authority to include a
Condition of Approval regarding a café.

Don Larkin, Assistant City Attorney reported the Council could condition the
project to be consistent with information presented.             An absolute
requirement of a café would be problematic. He suggested asking the
applicant if it would accept language of using best efforts to include a café.
The City would not want an empty storefront.

Council Member Burt indicated his question concerned the Council's
authority.

Mr. Larkin believed it was not within the Council's authority to require a use
more strict than zoning laws would allow.

Mayor Yeh confirmed the Council had no disclosures.

Vice Mayor Scharff inquired if the Council could include the requirement to
keep the storefront vacant or build a café if the applicant agreed.

Mr. Larkin answered yes.

Vice Mayor Scharff asked whether the Council could include, with the
applicant's agreement, a requirement to lower the rental amount if a café
tenant could not be found.

Mr. Larkin answered yes.

Vice Mayor Scharff inquired whether the Council's alternatives were to vote
against approval or condition approval on the applicant's agreement to
include a café.

Mr. Larkin reported placing an exact condition more restrictive than zoning
laws allowed was problematic.

Mr. Williams suggested the Council indicate one of the purposes of such a
requirement would be to enliven the streetscape and pedestrian
environment, which would connect to the site and design component of the
project.
