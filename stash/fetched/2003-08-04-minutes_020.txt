Council Member Kishimoto asked about the registration issue and the “shall”
register sign wording. She asked if someone went to the school office to
register, and if there would be any reason they would receive a no answer.

Mr. Golton said the PAUSD had first priority on the use of the fields.
Permission would be granted if the fields were not in use.

Council Member Kishimoto asked if someone could sit on the lawn with their
child if they wanted.

Mr. Golton said the hypothetical question was a good one, but the issue was
about the soccer fields and middle school students all over the fields and
sidelines. The PAUSD did not feel it would be a safe use for either middle
school students or individuals.

Council Member Kishimoto asked if Mr. Golton believed that between 7:30
a.m. and 3:30 p.m. if someone came to register, the school would say “no.”

Mr. Golton replied the school could say “no.”

Council Member Kishimoto had a question about alternatives. She said if all
the tennis courts were converted as a permanent solution, could Gunn tennis
courts be used during the day as part of the trade-off.

Mr. Golton said the tennis courts were good tennis courts.

Council Member Kishimoto asked Mr. Golton if he knew about the Gunn
tennis courts.

Mr. Golton said the public used the Gunn tennis courts after school.

Council Member Kishimoto asked if they would be available to be used
during the day.

Mr. Golton said the issue of priority of the school using the courts would be
in effect.

Council Member Freeman asked if there were plans in Terman’s future for a
tennis team.

Mr. Golton replied he did not have an answer to that question. He said that
all three schools would have equitable programs. He was not aware that
Jordan had a tennis team.

Council Member Freeman clarified Jordan had a tennis program.
