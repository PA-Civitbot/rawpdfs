Mayor Burt: At this time, we're going to commence with the continuation of
567 Maybell, approval of a Mitigated Negative Declaration and a tentative
tract map with lot size exceptions to subdivide four parcels totaling 2.47
acres into 16 single-family lots, ranging from 5,000 square feet to 6,186
square feet and one parcel for a private street.       The environmental
assessment is a Mitigation Negative Declaration. The zoning districts are R-
2 and RM-15. This item was continued from June 20th. We had a Staff
Report. I don't know whether you have any other things to share. At this
time, we are open to having questions from Council Members. I think we

pedestrian path consideration and, secondly, on the in-lieu fees. At what
point in time did Staff bring forward a recommendation for a pedestrian
path?
