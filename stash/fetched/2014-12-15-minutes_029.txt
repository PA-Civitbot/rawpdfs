Mr. Ghaemmaghami had heard from private developers that they were
having a hard time locating TDRs. People who had TDRs were not selling
them. He believed there was an active market for TDRs.

Council Member Schmid inquired whether the City controlled; in any way,
the private eligibility for TDRs.

Mr. Ghaemmaghami was not aware of any City controls.

Council Member Schmid asked if it was a private decision to provide a TDR.

Mr. Ghaemmaghami replied yes, to provide or to sell them.

Council Member Schmid inquired whether the City had a list of sites eligible
to provide TDRs.

Mr. Ghaemmaghami was not aware of such a list. The Planning Department
did research the issue, and he could provide an answer at a later time.

Council Member Schmid found it difficult to estimate a value without
knowing the market. He asked if there was currently a hold on TDRs.

Mr. Ghaemmaghami clarified that the City was holding its TDRs. There had
been a few transactions involving privately owned TDRs. People were
looking for TDRs and having a hard time finding them.

Council Member Schmid recalled the Council changed TDRs to exclude
parking exemptions. He inquired about the impact of that change on the
value of TDRs.

Mr. Ghaemmaghami reported TDRs that applied to parking had a much
higher value.    TDRs currently in the marketplace would be used for
additional square footage, not parking. The market had driven the price for
those high as well.

Council Member Schmid requested          Staff   provide   some   background
information as to TDR value.

Mr. Ghaemmaghami would do so.

Council Member Klein asked why Ms. Gitelman was in the audience rather
than at the table answering questions.

Hillary Gitelman, Director of the Planning and Community Environment, did
not have a lot of experience or information about the current project or with
the TDR program.
