Mr. Benest asked, as a public policy, should hospitals be required to mitigate
the demand for housing when they employ lower income workers.

Mr. Baum clarified Stanfordâ€™s consultant did not recognize there was a clinic
in Palo Alto; whereas, half of the impact would be from a clinic. Therefore,
the description of what would be done in hospitals would not be relevant to
the discussion.

Mayor Kishimoto confirmed clinics were never exempt.

Council Member Beecham asked whether the 1.3 million square feet would

Robert Moss, 4010 Orme Street, stated he agreed with the staff

expressed concern that there was no clarity in the zoning code as to what

Jean McCown, 527 Seale Avenue, stated she disagreed with the impact fees.
The fees would diminish the financial resources, which go to the mission of
the hospitals and provide health care services to the community.

Mark Tortoride, Stanford Hospital/LPCH, clarified one third of the 1.3 million
square feet would be to house existing programs, which would not have any
employment growth. By licensing-out patient clinics under a hospital license,
