Council took a break at 9:25 p.m. reconvening at 9:30 p.m.

Public Hearing opened at 9:32 p.m.

Chop Keenan, 700 Emerson, spoke regarding the costs associated with this
Ordinance for commercial projects.

Steve Dostart, 737 High Street, spoke regarding the lack of outreach to
developers regarding this Ordinance and the costs associated with green
building.

Steve Broadbent, 575 Washington Avenue, spoke about the impacts of
dewatering and residential basements.

Brian Parker, Build it Green, spoke commending Palo Altoâ€™s leadership in
green building and suggested changes to the Ordinance.

Jim Baer, 172 University Avenue, spoke regarding various issues of practical
application of the Ordinance.

Emily Renzel, 1056 Forest Avenue, spoke in support of the green building
regulations with concern for ongoing improvements in carbon footprint
reductions.

Council Member Burt asked Mr. Baer to explain his concern for an
enforcement mechanism other than the Commissioning Agent.

Mr. Baer stated that the certification during the 36 month period be done by
a LEED Accredited architect but reinforced by a Commissioning Agent versed
in Title 24 requirements.

Mayor Klein asked Mr. Baer to clarify whether the Commissioning agent
would be part of the team or an independent.

Mr. Baer stated they are a member of the team however the Commissioning
Agent is a Title 24 specialist and inspects after installation to confirm for
instance the energy used in the building is in fact what was specified in the
plans. A LEED accredited architect is not able to certify that some technical
details are in fact what were built.

Mayor Klein asked if this engineer would be professionally responsible for his
evaluation.

Mr. Baer stated they would certify just as they would for LEED that the
energy envelope has met whatever threshold is being required for the
specific points.
