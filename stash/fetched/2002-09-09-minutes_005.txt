2.   Proclamation in Remembrance of September 11

Mayor Ojakian urged residents to attend events in honor of the
September 11 terrorist attack.

Council Member Lytle thanked Mayor Ojakian and staff for
arranging opportunities for the community to come together to
observe the anniversary of the September 11 terrorist attack.

Council Member Kleinberg suggested lowering the City flags to
half-mast every year in memory of those who died and those who
aided the September 11 victims.       A city in the East Bay
originated that idea, and she wanted have it placed on the
agenda. She encouraged the public to attend a candlelight vigil
at the Memorial Grove at Eleanor Pardee Park on September 11 at
7:00 p.m.    She requested a moment of silence be observed in
memory of those who died and the heroes who responded to the
disasters in New York, Washington, D.C., and Pennsylvania.
