Ms. Stump understood the Council wanted six units to be constructed as
soon as administratively possible. There were issues to be resolved at the
administrative level before construction could occur.

Council Member Holman questioned the use of the term "assess" in Item 8c,
because the Council asked Staff to return with recommendations for a fine
amount.

Ms. Stump asked if the intention of the Motion was for the Item to return
under the framework provided for final determination by the Council or that
Staff apply the framework and assess a fine.

Vice Mayor Shepherd explained the penalty would be defined under Item 9,
and return to the Council with the PC and the SEIR.

Mayor Scharff asked if Staff should present the Council with a fine or
options.

Ms. Stump suggested Staff should apply the framework and return with a
number for Council consideration.

Vice Mayor Shepherd suggested Item 8c was not needed, because it was
addressed in Item 9.

Council Member Holman stated Item 9 did not appear to assess a penalty for
the loss of the public benefit, because it did not mention the demolition of
Building 1.

Council Member Klein disagreed. "The fine" as stated in Item 9 referred to
language in Item 8c regarding an appropriate penalty for the demolition of
Building 1.

Council Member Holman did not see the Items as related.

Council Member Klein reiterated that "the fine" referred to the last time it
was used.

Vice Mayor Shepherd wanted Item 8c replaced in the Motion.
