AMENDMENT: Council Member Kishimoto moved, seconded by Freeman, to
eliminate the clause in the Ordinance that allows second stories on
substandard lots without a variance.

Vice Mayor Kleinberg said she could not vote until she found out what the
current law was.

Mr. Lusardi said there could be an application for a second story with a new
house or second story addition on a substandard lot. A variance needed to
be approved, which required specific findings. Staff and the P&TC proposed
that an IR rather than variance be required. Second story additions on
substandard lots 30 feet or wider were limited.

Vice Mayor Kleinberg said staff and the P&TC recommended something that
was smaller in the outcome and a more streamlined process.

Mr. Lusardi said the variance application was replaced with the IR process,
which gave neighbors an opportunity for input. The height on substandard
lots was eliminated.

Ms. Cassel said the daylight plane severely limited heights of buildings
because the usable space was small. Only the larger lots were allowed to do
anything.

Council Member Freeman asked whether a hearing was allowed when a
variance was requested.

Mr. Lusardi said there was a hearing only when requested by a member of
the community.

Council Member Freeman clarified neighbors or having a variance rather
than an IR did not eliminate others in the community.

Mr. Lusardi said that was correct.

Council Member Mossar said the IR process was adopted as a result of
serious problems and demands from the public for the City to come up with
a better way to look at residential development. Council Members talked
about the IR process as though it were a problem.

Ms. Cassel said the P&TC had a request to develop the ordinance in such a
way that variance requests were not made.
