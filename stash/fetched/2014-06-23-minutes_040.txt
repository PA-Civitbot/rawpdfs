Council Member Scharff said Mr. Barker mentioned sidewalks and a bike
lane.

Mr. Barker noted that the A, B, C streets narrowed when they hit California
Avenue; he felt like it gated the community in.

Council Member Scharff recalled the reason the A, B, C streets narrowed was
safety and not allowing people to park on the street.

Mr. Wuthmann said narrowing eliminated parallel parking and the travel
lanes were widened. They eliminated the street parking near the corners
because it slowed down traffic flow and could be unsafe; it was an
elimination of the parking near the street corners and a widening of the
travel lanes.

Council Member Scharff thought it looked like the lanes were narrowed.

Mr. Wuthmann said if the streets were not combined, visitors would park
there. He suggested a landscape strip and street trees for that entry portion
of the street.

Council Member Scharff suggested no parking signs.

Mr. Wuthmann agreed but said that reduced street tree planting that was
planned for that spot. People that were unfamiliar with the area would slow
the traffic. Red curb was a possibility, or space could be created so there
was room for a larger planting strip instead of 12 foot travel lanes.

Council Member Scharff suggested a bike lane on California Avenue.

Mr. Wuthmann thought a bike lane was in the category with the crosswalks.
This was the decision of the City and community, not just the developer.

Council Member Scharff inquired about the right to require the bike lane
along a portion of the development.

Ms. Gitelman answered that it was not required as mitigation, and was not
sure that the Planning Department could require this.
