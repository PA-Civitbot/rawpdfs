Council Member Schmid suggested a prioritization of questions related to the
Comprehensive Plan, visioning, and engagement would be helpful. It might
be helpful for the Council to engage in determining the first steps.

Mr. Keene indicated it was not realistic for Staff to prepare information in
only eight days for the Council meeting on December 16, 2013. Staff
needed time to organize and compile information. All the main pieces were
there; Staff needed time to add details regarding the process.

Council Member Burt inquired whether a discussion in January 2014 was
feasible.

Mr. Keene would begin working on information and provide a status update
close to the New Year. Staff could present the two PC projects for a decision
on January 13, 2014.

ADJOURNMENT: The meeting was adjourned at 12:05 A.M.
