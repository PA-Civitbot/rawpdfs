Council Member Schmid said his intent was to open a range of possibilities of
looking into different sites, locations, and economics. It would put a longer
term focus of getting into the anaerobic process, allow dropping the interim
step, and keep the BRTFâ€™s momentum generated.

Council Member Yeh felt it was a short diversion from the ultimate goal by
moving forward with the anaerobic process.

Council Member Espinosa said he supported the original Motion.

Council Member Kishimoto needed clarification on the Substitute Motion.
She wanted to know whether the long-term was being focused on and if the
maker of the Motion was saying not to pursue the intermediate step of the
aerated static pile.

Council Member Schmid clarified his suggestion was to focus on the long-
term goal and to look back after a decision was made on the best location,
place, and timing. A determination could then be made if an interim step is
feasible. It would open up discussion but would be a secondary long-term
goal.

Council Member Kishimoto asked whether the City would be shifting away
from the Windrows System.

Council Member Schmid said yes but not until the decision was made on
location and site.

Council Member Kishimoto asked for clarification regarding the Main Motion
and what was being viewed as interim and long-term.

Council Member Burt said it was to evaluate the two different locations and
to request Staff to return to the Council with additional information on cost
impacts and feasibility and whether to move forward with the interim
approach. The Amendment was in support of a long-term anaerobic
approach and to evaluate potential partnership with other cities.

Council Member Kishimoto asked if an evaluation was going to be done on
the Wastewater Treatment Plant.

Mr. Bobel said it would be done in 2010.
