Vice Mayor Beecham said he had gone through the material and information
from Barbara Dawson, the web site, and material from Britain’s top medical
agencies and concluded that fluoridation was safe and worthwhile to use in
the City’s water.

Council Member Kleinberg said she had given research physicians in the
Stanford/Palo Alto area, the information she had been given on fluoride, and
they all came back and told her that fluoride was safe.

Council Member Kishimoto believed it should be put on the ballot. She
noted in the City Attorney’s report that San Francisco planned to fluoridate
the Hetch Hetchy water in two years.

City Attorney Ariel Calonne said he did not have all the details.

Council Member Kishimoto asked if, as far as he knew, it had already been
decided.

Vice Mayor Beecham said San Francisco controlled Palo Alto’s water supply
and the City did not have a vote.

Council Member Burch believed it should be on the ballot.

MOTION PASSED 8-0, Morton absent.
