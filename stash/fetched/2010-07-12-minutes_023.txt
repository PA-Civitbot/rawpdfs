Mr. Struecker: Yes, we identified it as feasible in the traffic report but in the
EIR, because it is in another jurisdiction they took a little bit more
conservative approach.

Council Member Scharff: When you say it is in another jurisdiction you
mean Menlo Park, because if it says jurisdiction – Caltrans we don’t consider
that to another jurisdiction, correct?

Mr. Struecker: No, because of Menlo Park.

Council Member Scharff: Then 37 that we thought was feasible was in Santa
Clara County. So we are okay with that? That is not in Palo Alto.

Mr. Struecker: It is a traffic signal and pretty easy to do. So we listed that
as feasible.

Council Member Scharff: So why is 62 only potentially feasible when it says
the same thing as 37? I don’t mean to be difficult I am just curious why it
is.

Mr. Struecker: I guess because 37 is within the Stanford campus. This is
part of their project. It is a good point.

Council Member Scharff: Okay. So when I see potentially feasible should I
assume that there is a good likelihood these could be done, or does
potentially feasible mean it is going to be difficult to do these?

Mr. Struecker: The potentially feasible ones are ones that in my opinion are
highly likely. The ones that are infeasible are because of right-of-way and
cost issues are much more difficult.

Council Member Scharff: What makes number 10 so difficult that it is not
feasible?

Mr. Struecker: The cost and the impacts to right-of-way requirements in
just creating those improvements.

Council Member Scharff: Isn’t it on Stanford land? So wouldn’t the right-of-
way have to come from Stanford?

Mr. Struecker: Yes, it is probably mostly Stanford land, yes.

Council Member Scharff: So obtaining the right-of-way probably wouldn’t be
that difficult I would guess.
