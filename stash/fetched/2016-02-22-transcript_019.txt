Council Member Holman: I went to the City Agenda and looked at the Staff
Report. That's where I looked. They weren't there. That's where I looked.
Thank you.

Mayor Burt: Council Member Schmid, you had a quick follow-up.

Council Member Schmid: Yes. I did try and find Appendix H, which is a

Mayor Burt: Vice Mayor Scharff.

Vice Mayor Scharff: Which we know to be wrong.

Ms. Gitelman: ...is saying the State is achieving.      We haven't included
anything above that.

Vice Mayor Scharff: When we look at the housing scenario, when we
increase more housing, do we make any assumptions as to how many
residents of those new housing units actually live in Palo Alto? Otherwise, it
has no effect on commuting. In fact, it creates more traffic. If people live
here, they walk to work or they bike to work or maybe make ...
