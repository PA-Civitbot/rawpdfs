The second proposed amendment provided that the League Board could take
a position on a statewide ballot measure by a two-thirds vote of those
directors present. Currently the Board could take positions with a simple
majority vote. The City's ballot had to be returned to the League by April
19, 2013.

MOTION: Council Member Kniss moved, seconded by Council Member
Berman to move to support the League’s two amendments to the League’s
Bylaws to the membership and vote yes on amendment number 1-
Resolutions submitted to the League for presentation to the General
Assembly must be concurred by at least five or more cities or by city officials
from at least five or more cities; to vote yes on amendment number 2-the
League Board may take a position on a statewide ballot measure by a two-
thirds vote of those Directors present.

Council Member Kniss felt it was appropriate to support the amendments.

Council Member Klein did not believe there was a Staff recommendation.

Ms. Grider agreed she did not make a recommendation.

Council Member Klein asked why this item was before the Council.

Mayor Scharff reported Vice Mayor Shepherd, as liaison to the League, was
not comfortable voting on behalf of the Council.

Council Member Klein inquired whether Vice Mayor Shepherd had an opinion
on the proposed amendments.

Mayor Scharff did not recall whether she had an opinion.

Council Member Klein noted the proposed amendment made it more difficult
for the League Board to take a position on a ballot measure.

Council Member Kniss suggested the item could be continued to the next
Council meeting.

Mayor Scharff indicated continuing items burdened the Agenda.

Council Member Kniss did not believe the proposed amendments were
controversial. She would be willing to continue the item if Council Members
were agreeable.
