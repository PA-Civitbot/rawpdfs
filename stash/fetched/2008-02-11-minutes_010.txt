MOTION: Council Member Morton motioned, seconded by Council Member
Yeh to accept the Finance Committees recommendation that the City Council
review and comment on the forecast of revenues, expenses and reserve
levels and that the Council review and comment on the “Sustainable Budget”
report.

Mayor Klein asked for confirmation as to what acceptance meant. Accepting
the Long Range Financial Forecast didn’t mean Council was accepting
anything that had any policy implications.
