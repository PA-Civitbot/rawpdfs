Mr. Roberts listed the variety of factors which included wind, dust, noise,
and bacteria concerns.

Council Member Kishimoto asked what the difference was between buildings
and people living or working nearby.

Mr. Roberts stated it was a question of the concentration of the adjacent
land uses.

Council Member Kishimoto asked whether any application in neighboring
areas was approved for the inclusion of windrow operations in the last 10 to
20 years.

Mr. Roberts stated more specific research was required on this issue.

Council Member Kishimoto asked if the SMaRT Station had the land and/or
plans to include in-vessel composting in the near future.

Mr. Roberts stated that the City had not always participated in all the SMaRT
Station activities. Curbside recycling and composting had not gone through
the SMaRT Station, for example. His understanding was the SMaRT Station
was space-constrained in the areas of composting.

Mark Bowers, City of Sunnyvale, 456 West Olive Avenue, Sunnyvale, stated
no composting was planned at the SMaRT Station due to space constraints.
Construction and demolition operation was pending approval, but was
smaller in scale than a composting operation, in-vessel and/or windrow.

Council Member Kishimoto asked if there was a possibility to use any more
land around the SMaRT Station.

Mr. Bowers stated not much land was available. A recently closed landfill
was under consideration but a portion was open space, while a second
section was leased for concrete recycling.

Council Member Kishimoto asked how many acres was included in the entire
closed landfill.

Mr. Bowers stated it was a total of about 93 acres.

Council Member Kishimoto asked if deferment in creation of parklands was
included in the implications of commercial garbage suspension in Palo Alto.
