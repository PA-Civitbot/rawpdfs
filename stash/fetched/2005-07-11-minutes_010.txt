Mr. Marshall said he did not recall one ever being denied.

Council Member Morton questioned how the cost per residence was
determined.

Mr. Marshall said it was based on the previous UUD where the City
administered the contract and estimated approximately $4,000 per home.
Homeowners would be asked to consider the ten-year loan program to help
cushion the cost.

Council Member Beecham clarified the project was funded by the Electric
Utilities, Comcast, and SBC Communications. The cost to underground the
wires was shared by all who used the wires and not from funds used for
sewers or other issues.

MOTION: Council Member Beecham moved, seconded by Mossar, to adopt
an Ordinance to create Underground Utility District No. 41 and thereby
amend section 12.16.020 of Chapter 12.16 of Title 12 of the Palo Alto
Municipal Code.

            Ordinance 1st Reading entitled “Ordinance of the Council of the
            City of Palo Alto Amending Section 12.16.020 of Chapter 12.16
            of Title 12 of the Palo Alto Municipal Code by Establishing
            Underground Utility District No. 41”

Vice Mayor Kleinberg said the project was not a City-funded program paid by
the residents. She asked whether residents were willing to be assessed.

Mr. Marshall said it would become an assessment if they opted to take the
loan.

Vice Mayor Kleinberg asked if the underground wiring was a mandatory
program and the only question from the residents was if they wanted the
loan.

Mr. Marshall said that was correct.

Vice Mayor Kleinberg said she did not get a sense from the public that the
program was mandatory. She needed clarification that Council was voting to
approve the UUD project.

Mr. Marshall said that was correct and it would come back to Council with a
City Managers Report (CMR) for the financing.

Vice Mayor Kleinberg said she felt the project received great support. She
