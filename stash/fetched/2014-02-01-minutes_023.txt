Donna Grider, City Clerk, reported she provided notice the prior week.

Vice Mayor Kniss wanted to end Council meetings by 11:00 P.M. She would
be willing to note and provide the length of time Council Members spoke.
She was frustrated by the lack of Staff available to answer Council Member
questions on 9/80 Fridays. If the Council choose to meet one extra meeting
each month, the date should be predictable. She could not imagine not
having Minutes for meetings.

Council Member Holman suggested separating Council comments and
questions. Council Members could bring their devices to meetings in order
to email Motions to the Clerk. The Policy and Services Committee should
discuss the issue of early Packet release and standard criteria for Staff
Reports.

6.   Wrap-Up and Next Steps

Mayor Shepherd understood the Council supported the scheduling of
Wednesday meetings. The City Manager wanted to play a larger role in
moving meetings along.

James Keene, City Manager, liked the idea of Council Members submitting
questions to him early and Staff responding at Council meetings. Staff
placed items on the Consent Calendar to allow sufficient time for other
issues. Staff would attempt to place items on the Consent Calendar that
were not time sensitive.    He noted the Planning and Transportation
Commission met on Wednesday which could conflict with a Council meeting.

ADJOURNMENT: The meeting was adjourned at 2:25 P.M.
