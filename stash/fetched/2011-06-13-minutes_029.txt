between the two ball fields. He asked what prevented extending the oval
towards Alma Street to add more parking.

Mr. Snyder said the extension would be encroaching into Caltrainâ€™s right-of-
way and the structural section supporting the tracks and high voltage boxes
located at the edge of the parking lot. There was already encroachment into
the area for future restrooms and storage buildings.

Council Member Burt said it appeared there was some latitude to extend the
oval to allow for added parking in the area where buildings are located. He
said he would advocate reexamining extending the oval.

Mr. Snyder said he agreed there was some flexibility in the area.

Council Member Burt asked if it was possible to move the baseball field 10
feet south to allow widening the oval for additional spaces.

Mr. Snyder said there were challenges. The distance to the outfield fence
was short. He said a proposed wall would mass two utility boxes which were
access points to the buried reservoir and would limit adding the extra space.

Council Member Burt asked what the current zoning was.

Mr. Betts said it was Parking Facility (PF) zone.

Council Member Burt said PF was not necessarily recreational.

Mr. Betts said that was correct.      Fire stations, community centers, and
libraries were zoned PF.

Council Member Burt asked if zoning should be looked at for the park for
retaining the land for recreational purposes.

Ms. Stump said it was her understanding PF was the correct zoning for the
present use. Stanford would need to pursue an amendment for future
housing on the site.

Council Member Burt said housing was one thing and asked if Stanford
would be able to use it for other public facility functions different from the
recreational park functions used by Palo Alto.

Ms. Stump said she would need to get back with the information.
