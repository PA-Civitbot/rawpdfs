Mr. Emslie said the ARB would be consulted regarding the materials
and the roof profile.

Council Member Freeman asked whether the discussion would include
the Plaza.

Mr. Emslie said the applicant showed their study to enlarge the Plaza.
The results were to relocate the elevator shaft to the middle of the
Plaza, which defeated the objective to make the Plaza visible and
accessible from the street. The original design was superior to the
study design.

Council Member Freeman asked about the stairs from the parking
garage directly accessing the Plaza.

Mr. Emslie said the elevator shaft included the stairs. The results
prevented the public’s access and created a visible barrier. The ARB’s
recommended design for approval met the intent of that condition.

Council Member Freeman did not support the motion. She said it was
not because the people voted for the project but because there were
design issues that were not addressed to her satisfaction.

Council Member Kishimoto did not support the motion because she was
not in agreement with the design changes. She was against the
reduction of the retail spaces and the streetscape design.

MOTION PASSED 6-2, Freeman, Kishimoto, “no,” Morton absent.
