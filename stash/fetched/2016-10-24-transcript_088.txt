                         TRANSCRIPT
consideration of a permanent Ordinance and have that determination be
made as to what the structure of that Ordinance ought to be. I will offer a
substitute Motion that directs Staff after November 8th, assuming that Prop
64 passes, to agendize a Council discussion around a permanent Ordinance
to determine proper restrictions on outdoor growth of marijuana. This would
need a second. I hear none. We'll return to the initial Motion. Council
Member Schmid.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION: Mayor Burt moved, seconded by Council Member
XX, if Proposition 64, Marijuana Legalization is adopted, to direct Staff to
schedule a Council discussion of a regular Ordinance to provide restrictions
of outdoor cultivation of marijuana.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION FAILED DUE TO THE LACK OF A SECOND

Council Member Schmid: A friendly amendment. Currently, the timeline for
a second reading is November 7th, which is the day before the election. I
suggest just postponing that a week or two so the second reading would be
after the election.

Vice Mayor Scharff:    I think it does too.   Good catch, Council Member
Schmid.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to add to the Motion, “the second reading will
take place after the November 8, 2016 election.” (New Part D)

Ms. Stump: That's the minimum timeline. There's no maximum. That
makes a lot of sense, not to bother with the second reading until we see
what the voters do. Thank you.

Mayor Burt: Council Member Wolbach.

Council Member Wolbach: I'd like to offer a friendly amendment to have a
sunset at 12 months. I basically want some fire under us to really bring this
back quickly.

Vice Mayor Scharff: I'm good with that. Council Member Kniss?

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to add to the Motion, “incorporate a twelve month
sunset into the Ordinance.” (New Part E)

MOTION AS AMENDED RESTATED: Vice Mayor Scharff moved, seconded
by Council Member Kniss to adopt:

                                                                      Page 88 of 120
