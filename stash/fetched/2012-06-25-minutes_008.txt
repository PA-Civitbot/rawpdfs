Council Member Holman referenced Packet page 17, No. 8, regarding
amenities for visitors and occupants. She asked if visitors meant the public
at large.

Ms. French reported visitors meant visitors to the courtyard and to the
residential units.

Council Member Holman suggested the language should be members of the
public, visitors, and occupants. She asked about signage that would indicate
the public was allowed in the courtyard.

Mr. Williams felt the intent was not to make the interior courtyard a public
plaza. The plaza outside the café would be a natural area for the public.

Council Member Burt inquired whether it was Staff's understanding and
intent that the plaza would be public space and the interior courtyard would
be limited to visitors to residential and commercial occupants of the project.

Mr. Williams reported that would be the natural intention, in that the plaza
was located outside the café/retail area.

Council Member Burt asked if the applicant would agree to a café use and
public use of the plaza.

Ms. French stated past Planned Communities (PC) had areas for public use
and encroachments by restaurants. The Council would want tables and
chairs in the plaza to enliven the space.

Council Member Burt said it would be a public space for purposes of serving
the users of the food or beverage establishment.

Mayor Yeh advised the Council it could ask questions directly to the
applicant.

Council Member Burt asked the applicant to respond whether they were
willing to accept a café use and public use of the plaza.

Mr. Janz answered yes. The description of the use of the plaza versus the
interior courtyard was accurate. He expressed concern about finding a café
tenant who would be successful. The applicant would use best efforts,
including appropriate rental rates, to locate a tenant.
