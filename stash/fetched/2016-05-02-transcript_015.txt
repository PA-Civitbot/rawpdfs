Agenda Changes, Additions and Deletions

Mayor Burt: On that note, we move on to Agenda Changes, Additions and
Deletions. We're still in the same order, right? Our next item is City
Manager Comments.

James Keene, City Manager: Hold on, Mr. Mayor. I might have spoken out
of turn. Mr. Mayor, I was not at your meeting earlier this morning. Was
there any discussion about moving the Community Development Block Grant
item until after 12? Item Number 12 would be the first item now on your
Agenda. Is that correct?

Mayor Burt: We will have Item—Item 12 is the first item, and then ...

Mr. Keene:    Then you would move Item Number 9, the Community
Development Block Grant (CDBG) allocations, after 12, and then you would
take up Item 8, the single story overlay.

Mayor Burt: Correct. Thank you.

Mr. Keene: The CDBG item will just be very short.

Mayor Burt: Mr. City Manager, are you going with City Manager Comments
next?

Mr. Keene: I'm sorry, did you ...

Mayor Burt: I'm sorry. We need a Motion to change that. Sorry.

Vice Mayor Scharff: So moved.

Council Member Berman: Second.

MOTION: Vice Mayor Scharff moved, seconded by Council Member Berman
to hear Agenda Item Number 9- Finance Committee Recommends Adoption…
after Agenda Item Number 12- Colleagues' Memo From Council Members…

Mayor Burt: Please vote on the board. That passes unanimously.

MOTION PASSED: 9-0
