Mr. Baum stated they could deny the appeal with limitations on height, but
essentially pass the project.

Mayor Klein stated he did not know what the project looked like with the
height cut out.

Council Member Schmid agreed on not understanding what the project
would look like and that they were giving the Applicant freedom to
determine this with the height restrictions.

MOTION: Mayor Klein moved, seconded by Vice Mayor Drekmeier to
uphold the appeal height limit of fifty-feet, provide guidance to the
Architectural Review Board and Planning and Transportation Commission to
favor Variance on sidewalk width; cancellation of the seismic bonus and use
of the basement adding the restriction that the basement only be used for
mechanical equipment and storage.

Mr. Keller stated there was not a particular stated directive on whether or
not to use a Variance or DEE.

Mayor Klein stated he wanted to hear more about that from staff and the
Commissions.

Mr. Keller asked if he was directing them to look at changes of the setback
rules in general, and asked whether he wanted the Planning and
Transportation Commission to explore the issue and give further
recommendations.

Mayor Klein stated he would leave this up to them since it was not his policy
as Mayor to load general issues onto a specific Agenda item.

MOTION PASSED: 9-0

Council Member Morton left the Council meeting at 12:00 midnight.
