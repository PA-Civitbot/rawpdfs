goals in our Comprehensive Plan. Again, seniors, children, youth and people
with disabilities. I would add to that list the unhoused.

Mayor Holman: Council Member DuBois, I think one of the things that would
be helpful with this is that in your motion you don't acknowledge that what
you're talking about here in C-1, C-2, C-3, etc., are goals.

Council Member Wolbach: Yeah, because we're just talking about goals
tonight with the exception of two policies. Correct?

Mayor Holman: Correct.

Mr. Dennis: Correct.

Council Member DuBois: You'd put goals at the top ...

Mayor Holman:       Just to be clear going forward, it doesn't say goals
anywhere. That's one thing. The other is you made a statement about
retaining C-28, but that's also not referenced here. Just to be explicit, would
you like to add that to your motion?

Council Member DuBois: We can make it explicit. I figured it's there if we're
not removing it. It would remain there.

Mayor Holman: The question has been posed by Staff. I think, if you want
your motion to be explicit, you should include it in your motion. If that's
agreeable to you.

Council Member DuBois: You could retain Policy C-28.

Mayor Holman: Yes, that is Policy C-28.

Council Member DuBois: I don't know if Staff wants to answer Council
Member Wolbach about ...

Mayor Holman: Before you go there, you're retaining Policy C-28. You're
adding that to the motion. Council Member Filseth, are you good with that?
Okay.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to add to the Motion, “Retain Policy C-28.” (New
Part F)
Mayor Holman:     You're identifying these C1-5, you're identifying those as
goals. Right?
