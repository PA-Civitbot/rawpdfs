Council Member Kleinberg asked if he had been informed it was a violation.

Mr. Bradshaw said he was not informed until 1997.

Council Member Kleinberg asked when the last vehicle was stored on the
property.

Mr. Bradshaw said a van was brought to the property over a month prior.

Council Member Kleinberg asked whether Mr. Bradshaw thought it was legal
to store an additional vehicle after receiving notification about the other
vehicles.

Mr. Bradshaw said he did not have any other location to put the van.

Council Member Kleinberg asked whether he thought it was legal or illegal.

Mr. Bradshaw said he thought it was legal until it was stripped down.

Council Member Kleinberg said he had received notification from the City
that storage of inoperable vehicles was illegal.

Mr. Bradshaw said he felt it was legal since the vehicles were screened from
public view.

Mayor Beecham asked the City Attorney’s comments on any issue that may
arise because of any potential lack of appeal.

Ms. Furth said the City’s ordinance required the enforcement order to
contain a notice that individuals had the right to appeal and state the
deadline. Before a decision was made, it needed to be determined whether
Mr. Bradshaw was advised of his appeal right. Any further arguments from
Mr. Bradshaw or the Code Enforcement staff should be provided prior to a
decision. The item should be continued to a date certain.

MOTION: Council Member Mossar moved, seconded by Cordell, to continue
the item to the Council Meeting of July 12, 2004.

Mr. Benest said if there were any other issues, they should be brought up
that evening.

Council Member Mossar said information and clarity were needed.

Council Member Cordell said she recommended that Mr. Pintar and Mr. Bayer
brief the issue on the notice of appeal.
