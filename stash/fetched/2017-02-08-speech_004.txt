Our roots are also strengthened by the presence of local, community–based journalism.

Issues of importance to Palo Altans receive ongoing coverage, with opportunities for

letters to the editor, guest opinions and blog posts that express diverse points of view.

We have technologies that connect us as well, and allow citizens to have direct input

into policy decisions and direction. We are a better and stronger community because of

this, even when we may not agree with the coverage or the manner in which issues are

characterized.




I want to challenge all of us in the coming year to be mindful of these great strengths.

We may find ourselves in the months ahead needing to stand up for what we believe in

as a community—not because of what transpires in City Hall, but because of what

happens in Washington, D.C. Even as we debate important topics related to growth,

traffic and housing, let’s all remember how fortunate we are to be here.




I am proud that Palo Alto is a community that values diversity, multiculturalism, and

unity. Its community spirit is one of service. We all aspire to make the world a better

place, whether through technological innovation, restoring habitat in the baylands, or by

reducing our carbon foot print. We lead on fighting climate change, on protecting the

environment, on investing in infrastructure, on financial stewardship, and in providing

services to our residents.
