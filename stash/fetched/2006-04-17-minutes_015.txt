Betsy Allyn, 4186 Wilmar Avenue, said the initiative petition should be
placed on the election ballot. It was up to the citizens to determine the
outcome, not the Council.

Mary Davey, Los Altos Hills, presented the initiative which was scheduled to
appear on the November 2006 ballot. The intent of the initiative was to
ensure that the County preservation of open space, hillsides and ranch lands
and agriculture remained.

Council Member Morton asked whether the item would return on the Consent
Calendar and, if so, could the public still speak to the item.

Ms. Harrison said yes.

Council Member Morton said he would like the public to have more time to
familiarize themselves with the initiative. The Williamson Act had been
effective in helping people keep their farm land, but its protection only lasted
10 years. He support putting the matter over.

INCORPORATED INTO THE SUBSTITUTE MOTION WITH THE
CONSENT OF THE MAKER AND SECONDER that the agenda item return
on the Consent Calendar.

Council Member Mossar clarified she had not been asked to endorse the
initiative nor had it been explained to her.

Vice Mayor Kishimoto expressed support for voting on the matter that
evening.

Mayor Kleinberg failed to see how the matter being placed on the Consent
Calendar would add to the public debate. She noted the information was
made available by staff prior to the Council meeting.

Council Member Morton said the public would still be able to speak to the
item on the Consent Calendar.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION FAILED 2-5, Morton, Mossar yes, Drekmeier not
participating, Beecham absent.

MOTION PASSED 6-1, Mossar no, Drekmeier not participating, Beecham
