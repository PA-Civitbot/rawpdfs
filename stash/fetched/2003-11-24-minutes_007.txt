Ms. Furth said the routine agreements with the Stanford Research Park for
basic provisions of utilities needed to be handled.

Council Member Freeman asked if there were issues in the first three
months.

Mr. Benest said from the City’s review, it was believed that there were not
any contracts with Stanford in the first three months of 2004.

Ms. Furth said she believed that everything known could be managed.

Council Member Kleinberg asked about the Mayfield site.

Mr. Benest said the City and Stanford had agreed to a cost sharing provision
for the supplemental Environmental Impact Report (EIR), which would come
to the Council before January 1, 2004. The City was the lead agency for the
environmental assessment and an agreement with Stanford was not needed.
The Mayfield Development Agreement would not be made until late spring or
summer.

Council Member Freeman said the legislation would be regarding Council
Members voting and if staff would be permitted to work on issues without a
vote of the Council.

Mr. Benest said the contract had already been entered into and work should
continue on the Supplemental EIR. Staff would stop negotiating as of
January 1, 2004 on any development agreement with Stanford related to
Mayfield.

Ms. Furth said there were no specific cases where a conflict ceased because
Section 1090 was amended. The negotiations with Stanford on the
Development Agreement would need to be stopped as of January 1, 2004
and not resumed until after the legislation was received.

Council Member Freeman asked if the City’s Municipal Code could be an
option.

Vice Mayor Beecham said State law governed over City code.

Council Member Freeman said she was referring to the swearing-in date.

Vice Mayor Beecham said that would require a charter amendment.
