Council Member Kniss: You're on the original page, right?

Council Member DuBois: Right.

Mayor Holman: If what you're asking for then is for Staff to update based
on Staff recommendation, then that should be in the motion. If that's what
your intention is.

Council Member DuBois: Yeah. David, I sent you the text, if you want to
pull it up. With Staff's suggested minor revisions, that's correct. If that's
what you're pointing to.

Mayor Holman: That is what I'm trying to get to here, yes. Council Member
Burt, is that consistent with what your intention was in seconding?

Council Member Burt: Yeah, that's fine. I'll have a question of the maker.

Mayor Holman: Council Member DuBois, would you care to speak to your
motion?

Council Member DuBois: You can also delete "community." That's the right
name of the Element.

Mr. Dennis:    Mayor Holman, Staff has a question too when there's a
moment.

Council Member DuBois: Why don't you go ahead.

Mayor Holman: This would be a good time to ask it.

Mr. Dennis: Council Member DuBois, we were wondering specifically what
you were referring to for "mixed-use guidelines"? Was there a specific
section you're referring to or something?

Council Member DuBois: I was trying to identify the new sections in the PTC
version. Mixed-use was pretty new when the current Comp Plan was
adopted. There was a section called mixed-use guidelines. That was all I
was referring to.

Mr. Dennis: We'll take a look at that. Thank you.

Mayor Holman: Is that it for you, Council Member DuBois?

Council Member DuBois: Yep.

Mayor Holman: Council Member Burt.
