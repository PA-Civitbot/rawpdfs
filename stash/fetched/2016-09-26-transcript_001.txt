Proclamation honoring Cybersecurity Awareness Month. Council Member
Wolbach will be reading the Proclamation.

Council Member Wolbach read the Proclamation into the record.

Mayor Burt: Thank you. I believe that we have Jonathan Reichental and
other members of your Staff here. I'd like to come forward and present you
with the Proclamation. I'll just say that behind the scenes there's a lot of
hard work that goes into this. I just want to acknowledge that it's not just
something that happens automatically. Congratulations and thank you to
your whole team, Jonathan.

Bureau of Palo Alto. Would you wave your hand if you're one of those?
Thanks. Council Member Kniss read the proclamation into the record. Great
for you guys.     I think Pat's going to come down and deliver the
Proclamation.

Mayor Burt: Yes. I'll meet you there.
