BACKGROUND
On October 21, 2002, the City Council approved the Long-Term Electric Acquisition Plan
(LEAP) Guidelines (CMR:398:02). The Finance Committee reviewed the implementation
parameters of LEAP Guideline #6: Renewable Portfolio Investments on October 1, 2002,
recommending renewable energy targets of 10% of the City’s annual electric load by 2008 and
20% by 2015, and within the system average rate impact limit of ½ ¢/kWh. The Finance
Committee recommendation was approved by Council as part of the overall LEAP Guidelines.
On August 4, 2003, Council approved the LEAP Implementation Plan (CMR:354:03). Task #1 is
to acquire renewable energy resources to meet LEAP Guideline #6.

On January 14, 2004, staff presented the Utilities Renewable Energy Supply Implementation
Plan (Plan) to the Utilities Advisory Commission (UAC). The UAC report, presentation and
surrounding discussion summary were provided to Council as information on March 1, 2004
(CMR:168:04). The Plan has two tiers: (1) power purchase agreements (PPAs) for the near term
(2005-2008) to meet the 10% renewable investment target by 2008, and (2) exploring new
resource development opportunities for the longer term (2009-2015) to meet the 20% renewable
investment goal by 2015.
