Council Member Kishimoto asked whether it included the Hillview Avenue
area.

Council Member Morton said he would defer to staff although he did not
believe Palo Alto had any jurisdictional oversight over the Los Altos Hills
portion of Hillview Avenue. The Cityâ€™s impact would only be with respect to
the portions that fell within Palo Alto.

Mr. Emslie said as the plans for 3401 Hillview Avenue moved forward staff
had direction to outreach with the Palo Alto and Los Altos Hills neighbors.
The applicant had already conducted its own outreach to neighborhood
groups and leaders in the surrounding area.

Council Member Kishimoto asked if there was unhappiness with the proposed
mitigation of adding traffic lights.

Mr. Emslie said the development agreement represented that all of the
traffic impacts were fully mitigated. How it would be executed and
implemented involved making choices.

Council Member Kishimoto asked whether certification of the EIR meant
acceptance of the traffic signal mitigations.

Mr. Emslie said that was correct. In order not to do that, the Council would
have to make statements of overriding consideration, stating the mitigation
was infeasible.

Council Member Kishimoto said she preferred an overriding consideration
instead of putting in traffic signals.

AMENDMENT FAILED DUE TO LACK OF A SECOND

Vice Mayor Kleinberg said she sympathized with Council Member Kishimoto
and expressed support for the amendment; however, she did not believe
there would be enough support for it.

AMENDMENT: Council Member Kishimoto moved to incorporate the
compatibility findings from SOFA II.

Mr. Emslie said staff recalled considerable time was taken going over the
compatibility standards.

Council Member Kishimoto said it was the first time the Council had reviewed
the details of the agreement.
