time cost and the operational costs of moving the composting to the 10
acres.

Mr. Bobel said that they were not prepared for that tonight, but stated that
was something they would have brought back in four months.

Council Member Burt requested Vice Mayor Scharff explain the $120,000
figure.

Vice Mayor Scharff said that if the long term composting was continued at
the current site that was the $120,000 figure. He said that there would be a
charge to move composting to the 10 acre site. He said he remembered
Staff providing him an estimate.

Mr. Bobel said he did not recall an estimate. He said that they gave the long
term continuation costs. Staff did not update any costs about moving it to
another location. He said that there would be issues regarding the 10 acre
site as it was currently a hillside.

Council Member Burt said the long term continuation at current site had
been answered by the City Attorney.

Mr. Sartor said that current location was on parkland not on undedicated
parkland.

Council Member Burt said some of the speakers had raised an issue of the
ongoing permit with the state for composting. He asked if the Staff
concurred.

Mr. Bobel said that Mr. Gans was an expert in the area of permits, so Staff
would follow up on his statements and research them. Staff expected that it
would be necessary to have a different permit in order to have a new facility.

Council Member Burt said he was concerned about giving up the permit if it
had value. He said that was his main concern with the Motion as stated.

Mr. Bobel said that they needed additional time to explore this issue.

Council Member Schmid said he was pleased with the work done and
celebrated the opening of the parkland. He wanted Staff to conduct the
study and examine all the issues with moving ahead. He said that one
consequence was the delay in the opening of the fifty plus acres of parkland.
