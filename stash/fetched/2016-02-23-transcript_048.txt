Council Member Filseth: I'll accept those.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to add to the Motion, “include dailies and
scratchers in the Resolution.” (New Part C)

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to add to the Motion, “move up Council review to
six months.” (New Part D)

Council Member DuBois: Staff, do you have any comments on that?

Ms. Gitelman: Let me just read what we were thinking in terms of language
on the dailies and scratchers. This is in Section Five of the Resolution, in
Subsection (c)(2)(g), Paragraph One.

Council Member Schmid: What page is that?

Council Member DuBois: It's the Appendix A, 2A.

Ms. Gitelman: It's Page Five of the Resolution.

Council Member Schmid: Of the Resolution. Got it. Packet Page 20.

Ms. Gitelman: There's a paragraph in the middle there that's Paragraph
One. We would add a phrase kind of in the middle of that paragraph. It
would read "distribution of daily and fiveday employee scratchers will be
zone specific and will be sold randomly except that no daily or five day
scratchers will be sold for Zones 9 and 10."

Council Member DuBois: If I could speak to that? Did you accept that?

Council Member Filseth: Yes.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to replace Part C of the Motion with, “add to
Resolution Section 5(c)(2)(g)(1) ‘no daily or five day scratchers will be sold
in Zones 9 and 10’ after ‘be sold randomly.’”

Council Member DuBois: A couple of things. Again, I think whether
everybody's mad at us or not, I think, depends on where we end up at the
end here. Not that that is how we make decisions. Again, I appreciate
some of the comments from people in Crescent Park saying they support our
retailers and our businesses. Accepting some small amount of parking there
for a year or two before the reductions start, I want to thank you for that.
Not selling the dailies and permits in those zones will, again, help preserve
                                                                        Page 48 of 66
