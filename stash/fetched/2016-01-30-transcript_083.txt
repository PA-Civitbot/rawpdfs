Mayor Burt: I see.

Vice Mayor Scharff: The 19th is a Monday.

Mayor Burt: Let me see what Council Member DuBois has to add.

Council Member DuBois: A friendly amendment that we let Staff go home while

Council Member DuBois: Thank you, guys, for being here all day.

Council Member Kniss:    (inaudible) July, Greg, and let them (inaudible) we'll

Mayor Burt: Sorry. Let's vote at this time on a summer break and defer to the

Council Member Holman: I have a question about the schedule though. Some

about being out of town on July 4th. I'm just wondering if there's any
consideration of June 27. I'd like to amend June 27 to August 5. I don't think
the school schedule affects any of us here. I'd like to amend the summer
schedule to June 27 to August 5.

Mayor Burt: The school schedule doesn't affect any of us?

Council Member Holman: I don't think any of us have kids in schools, do we?
You do still?

Vice Mayor Scharff: I do.
