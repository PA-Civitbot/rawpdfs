Mr. Williams said Staff could move forward and evaluate the scenarios if the
Council was comfortable in the direction Staff was going.

Mayor Burt asked whether or not to expand the scope of the existing work
plan in Staff Report CMR:152:10, Section D, Number 3.

Council Member Shepherd said the Authority indicated properties could be
repurposed after the tracks were removed. She asked if it would be possible
to include zoning for housing even if it did not materialize for awhile.

Mr. Williams said it was not possible because Staff would need to show it
had been zoned for housing or until the area was zoned for housing.

Council Member Shepherd said situations could change by 2020 and asked
to discuss the HSR land use scenarios.

MOTION: Council Member Price moved, seconded by Council Member
Holman that the Rail Corridor Study be brought to the City Council on
Monday, June 28, 2010 for action.

Council Member Price raised concerns that if the item was not brought
forward it would be pushed into mid-July.

Mr. Williams said a draft of the study had been presented to the HSR
Standing Committee regarding scope and budget for the project. It was a
16-month study and cost $240,000. The first phase was to develop policy,
the second phase was technical analysis on land use options, and the third
phase was on implementation.

Council Member Scharff asked if the $240,000 was coming from the General
Fund.

City Manager, James Keene said yes.

Council Member Scharff asked if it would be included in the current yearâ€™s
budget.

Mr. Keene said it would be best to budget for it sooner but could be done
later. Funds could be moved and budget amendments processed at mid-
year.

Mayor Burt clarified the expenditure was for a year-and-a-half instead of one
year.
