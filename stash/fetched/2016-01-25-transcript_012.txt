Staff has recommended continuing.

MOTION: Council Member Holman moved, seconded by Council Member
DuBois to approve Agenda Item Numbers 3-13, and 15.

Mayor Burt: The Consent Calendar has been moved for approval by Council
Member Holman, seconded by Council Member DuBois, absent Item Number
14 which will be removed. Any discussion?

Vice Mayor Scharff: I think I'm recused from Item Number 10 because I
own real property close to one of the garages. I'm going to recuse myself
from Item 10.

Molly Stump, City Attorney: Thank you, Mayor Burt. Council Member Kniss
is also recused on Item Number 10.

Council Member Kniss: Thank you. Thank you for the reminder.

Mayor Burt: Council Member Kniss and Vice Mayor Scharff are recused from
Item Number 10. We're voting on this excluding Item Number 14.

Ms. Stump: If I may, Mr. Mayor?

Mayor Burt: I'm sorry.

Ms. Stump: Just for the record, those recusals are related to real property
interests that are close by two of the four garages that are at issue in that
lease Item. Thank you.
