east of Highway 101 which contributed to the maintenance of both the
Amphitheater, Golf Course, and the park.

Mr. Roberts stated the understanding with Shoreline was there was a long-
term contract with the City and County of San Francisco where they gave up
their Refuse Funds for ten years, established an Endowment Fund for the
park area, and there was a redevelopment area which generated revenues.
He stated with Menlo Park there was funding from Landfill Reserve
Operations and redevelopment in their industrial area.

Council Member Yeh asked what role the different Phases played as a buffer
to the landfill.

Mr. Roberts stated the refuse landfill operation was confined to a lower
elevation and no longer had issues with airborne debris. He stated the major
concern with a buffer was with the existing composting operation and the
dust it generated.

Council Member Yeh asked whether there would be a public health risk from
the dust and debris.

Mr. Roberts stated once the City applied for the permit from the LEA, they
performed a review to determine any health risks.

Council Member Kishimoto stated she approved the Colleagues Memo
without her requested changes.

Council Member Espinosa clarified the Colleagues Memo was not approving
dollars but rather asking Staff to return to Council with budget estimates.

Council Member Klein asked for an estimated cost for the expense for
Hargreaves to develop final park design goals.

Mr. Roberts stated he would estimate the expense at $25 to $50 thousand.

Council Member Klein asked the source from which the expenses would be
paid.

Mr. Roberts stated the funds would need to come from the General Fund or
Park Impact Fees.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION TO CONTINUE: Council Member Klein moved,
seconded by Council Member Barton to continue the Agenda Item until
budget preparation for Fiscal Year 2011.
