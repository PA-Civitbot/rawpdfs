CONSENT CALENDAR

Ben Davenport encouraged the Council to consider the negative impacts of
implementing an overnight parking ban on Crescent Park residents. He
questioned the wisdom of parking bans in that the problem simply shifted in
response to the bans.

Megan McCaslin supported an overnight parking ban in Crescent Park and an
eventual residential parking permit program.

R. Norse stated permit parking could be used to remove homeless people
from areas.    The ban should be discussed more fully before being
implemented.

Andy Voight noted City Staff discussed parking options with residents of
Crescent Park. The parking ban would inconvenience all residents; however,
the neighborhood needed a resolution for the problem.

MOTION: Council Member Kniss moved, seconded by Council Member Price
to approve Agenda Item Numbers 4-11 and 13-15.
