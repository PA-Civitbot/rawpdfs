                         TRANSCRIPT
Mr. O’Hanlon: I have no further comments, other than to request if we
might be able to get to a vote tonight rather than put things off with all the
support and community we have here tonight. Thanks.

Public Hearing closed at 10:50 P.M.

Mayor Burt: Thank you. At this time, we'll close the Public Hearing. We're
going to continue the item to ...

Council Member Holman: Mr. Mayor?

Mayor Burt: ... June 28th. Council Member Holman.

Council Member Holman: Could I suggest that—I was thinking the same
things as the applicant. I listened to the comments in the back. If I could
make a Motion and if a lot of lights go on, I'll immediately withdraw it, but
just to see if we come to a quick resolve to this matter. If you'd be open to
that.

Mayor Burt: Let me instead turn to colleagues and see which colleagues
think there are certain substantive issues that we want to still discuss. I
think at least three of us. I think we'll go ahead and continue the item to
June 28th.

Council Member Kniss: Is that Monday or Tuesday?

Mayor Burt: That's Tuesday. That's our Special Meeting.        Thank you all
very much for attending tonight.

This Agenda Item was continued to the June 28, 2016 Council meeting.
