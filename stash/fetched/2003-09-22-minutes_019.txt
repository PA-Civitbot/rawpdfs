Council Member Kleinberg said transportation would be looking for
pockets for adjustment.

Mr. Kott said there were differences in traffic density along the whole
Corridor.

Council Member Kleinberg asked if the study would impede the flow of
traffic from the east end of the Corridor.

Mr. Kott said averaging the delay was being studied.

Council Member Kleinberg said she was concerned about the
vagueness of the language and wanted to be sure that development
would not be prohibited.

Council Member Kishimoto said she was interested in noise and air
quality impacts as performance measures. The Comp Plan goals of a
walkable and bikeable community were going forward.

Council Member Freeman said all the potential housing opportunities
added up to 1,498 housing units proposed. A high level of students,
approximately 40+ percent used bicycles along the Corridor to get to
Terman School.

Council Member Burch said everything was on the table for staff to
look at for Charleston/Arastradero to make it the best it could be and
could handle future development. It was not a land use decision, as
much as it was a transportation corridor decision.

Mayor Mossar asked staff why the performance measures in 11 were
not congruent with performance measures in the agenda item.

Mr. Kott said it was a different geographic focus.

Mayor Mossar said the concerns raised that evening underscored the
importance of listening to everyone.        The business community
expressed their concerns clearly and fairly.        The business and
residential communities needed to work together to create a
Charleston Corridor that would be an integral part of the community.
