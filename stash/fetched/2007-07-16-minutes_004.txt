STUDY SESSION

2.    Community Alerting and Emergency Notification System

Police staff presented the proposed community alerting and emergency
notification solution, along with a contract with NTI Group, Inc. (NTI) for
annual services related to providing a fully-hosted and managed community
alerting and emergency notification system. NTI provides comprehensive
communication systems designed specifically for local, regional, State, and
Federal government entities to enable rapid dissemination of critical
information via voice and text devices. Presented during the study session
was information on the process of selecting the vendor, outreach and
collaboration with the community and interdepartmental working groups, as
well as information on the features and functionality of the new alerting and
notification system.      The managed alerting system offers diverse
functionality and the ability to reach out to tens of thousands of residents
simultaneously and through a variety of mediums (email, text messaging,
voice and wireless phone calls).

Jeff Griffin, 470 Nevada Avenue, expressed concern about overloading the
system and spending an unnecessary amount of money. He pointed out
Contra Costa Countyâ€™s system was regarded as the foremost emergency
notification operation center in the world.
