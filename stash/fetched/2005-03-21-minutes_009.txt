Council Member Morton asked whether the Council was being asked to vote
against the BART Extension Project, or the proposed Long-Term CIP, until an
effective, feasible and financially sustainable alternative to the project was
developed. He hoped there would be a brighter future for public transit in
the Bay area.

Mr. Kott said staff’s intent was not to express an opposition to an extension
of BART. The word “current” BART Extension project referred to the present
configuration in which the BART Extension would take place.

MOTION PASSED 7-0, Kleinberg, Ojakian absent.
