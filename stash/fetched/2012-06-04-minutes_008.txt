Council Member Espinosa pointed out that the City had facilities spread out
across the community and when one thought about infrastructure
development it was clear that it was a monumental task to wire Palo Alto.
He appreciated the clarifications and the work done. He found the project to
be price appropriate.

Council Member Klein referred to the $100,000 cost savings and asked if
there were further cost savings produced by the new system.

Mr. Vondra said there were, but they were not as noteworthy as the
$100,000 previously mentioned. He said they found many cities had saved
on labor costs because technicians were not needed since remote support
was easy. That was an indirect cost savings that the City would realize. The
ability to have cell phones tie into the wireless network saved cellular
minutes. They did not spend time and money looking into the additional
cost savings as the $100,000 was the noteworthy savings.
