a motion to put over the vote on appointment of new members.

Mr. Baum confirmed State law provides for commissioners to continue to serve
for a short duration only after their term has expired, and this item would be
listed on the agenda for appointment, as it would have been.

Council Member Beecham supported the recommendation for current P&TC
members to continue serving to complete ZOU.

Vice Mayor Kishimoto questioned if there would be a plan to improve signage to
currently available downtown public restrooms.

Ms. Harrison confirmed staff would look at this within the current budget and, if
not possible, the cost for better signage would be incorporated into next year’s
budget.

Mayor Kleinberg noted the League of California Cities’ By-Laws stipulate a city’s
voting delegate and alternate must be designated by the City Council.
Therefore, this item will come back on a future agenda. The Saturday Wall
Street Journal had an article regarding technology innovation and small cities
with many patents, and Palo Alto was one of the ten top cities with the highest
number of patents.
