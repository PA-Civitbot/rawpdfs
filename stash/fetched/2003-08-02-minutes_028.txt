Council Member Kleinberg clarified following the procedure as laid out
would be part of the motion.

Ms. Furth said that was correct.

Council Member Ojakian asked about the impact of the transfer of
development rights if the property at Channing Avenue and High
Street were rezoned to RT-50.

Ms. Furth said staff tried to recall whether the covenants had been
recorded on the two properties.

Council Member Ojakian asked what happened if the property were
changed to RT-50.

Vice Mayor Beecham understood the TDR process in progress was
under existing zoning.

Ms. Furth said that was correct. The bonus was calculated on the area
of the lot.

INCORPORATED INTO MOTION WITH CONSENT OF MAKER AND
SECONDER to delete from RT-50 the parcel to the southwest corner
of High Street, south of Channing Avenue (parcel 900 High Street), to
become RT-35.

Vice Mayor Beecham said the intent was to delete everything on High
Street, south of Channing Avenue.

Council Member Kishimoto suggested deleting the two historic
buildings that were mid-block on High Street, between Forest Avenue
and Homer Avenue.

Council Member Kleinberg asked what the problem was, since the
Council already provided for strict rules for the historic properties.

Mr. Emslie said if there were constraints under the protection of the
historic, properties were not likely to redevelop. Whether the property
was RT-50 or RT-35, spoke to the likelihood that the property would
redevelop. The Council tried to match site constraints to the
development potential. The development potential was expressed in
the RT-50, based on economic analysis done by staff, and the
propensity for lots closer to Alma Street to be redevelopable.
