Council Member Holman: That's correct.

Council Member Fine: I think that would be more specific and more what I
would like to see in this.

Council Member Holman: It's a shopping area; it's a shopping center. We
don't want housing on the ground floor.

Council Member Fine: Right, I completely agree. As it's written right now,
it's limiting housing to second floor at floor office conversions, which I think
is a bit limiting. I would prefer to have housing potential there, above the
ground-floor retail. There's a small difference. If it's limited to second-floor
office, then that's all it could be. It couldn't be a third floor.

Council Member Holman: That's correct.

Council Member Fine: Then I don't accept it. I'm sorry.

Council Member Holman: Again, that's guided by many of the other policies
and programs that are in the Comp Plan.

Council Member Filseth: You don't want third-floor housing?

Council Member Holman: No.

Council Member Filseth: Why not?

Council Member Holman: I'll repeat it again. Because of several other
Comprehensive Plan policies and programs that talk about preserving the
character of Town and Country Village.

Mayor Scharff: Council Member Holman, I actually agree with you, but
maybe we'll come back to it. Go ahead and make the Amendment.

Council Member Holman: I can't hear you.

Mayor Scharff: We'll come back to it and make an Amendment, because I
actually agree with you. We'll come up with something as I think about it.

AMENDMENT: Council Member Holman moved, seconded by Vice Mayor
Kniss to add to the Motion Part C, “which would be limited to second floor
office conversion.”
