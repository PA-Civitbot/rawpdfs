overwritten by the zoning.

Council Member Freeman said the two small properties on the corner could
be separated physically by a large development that would decrease the
historic value along Homer Avenue.

Ms. Grote said a requirement would be made to meet the compatibility
requirements in the plan.

Ms. Furth said staff marked the map on parcel basis and the entire site
would be marked even though the buildings on the site were not historic.
The footprint of the historic structures had been overstated.

Council Member Kishimoto asked if the vote would be on a parcel basis.

Ms. Furth said the proposal would be for zoning to be on a parcel-by-parcel
basis. The map was supposed to indicate the portions that were originally
recommended as RT-50 and then sub sequentially changed to RT-35.

Ms. Grote said the front part of the parcel fronted on Homer Avenue and was
the more historic portion.

Vice Mayor Beecham asked if integral zoning parcels were shown.

Mr. Emslie said one parcel was bifurcated by zone. The zoning did not have
to be done on a whole parcel basis.

Ms. Furth confirmed that code did not require a parcel to have one zone.

AMENDMENT FAILED 2-5, Beecham, Freeman, Kishimoto, Kleinberg, Lytle
“yes”

AMENDMENT: Council Member Freeman moved, seconded by Lytle, to
insert 24-hour public parking within the Coordinated Area Plan.

Council Member Freeman had concerns that public parking could be
truncated. Public parking should be available at all times.

Council Member Burch asked whether the underground parking at 800 High
Street would be available to the public 24 hours a day.

Mr. Emslie said the parking at 800 High Street would not be available 24
hours a day.

Council Member Burch asked if the motion would make it available.

Ms. Furth said the motion had no effect on 800 High Street.
