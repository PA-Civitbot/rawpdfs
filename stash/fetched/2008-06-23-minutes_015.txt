Council Member Kishimoto asked if the City was paying for refuse land
elsewhere.

Mr. Roberts asked for clarification on elsewhere as outside of Palo Alto city
limits.

Council Member Kishimoto stated she meant outside of the existing sites.

Mr. Roberts stated there were separate facilities utilized in regards to
customer service offices and vehicle storage.

Council Member Schmid asked if some of the trade-offs could be fleshed out
as far as financial and policy issues.

Mr. Roberts summarized the costs and diversions of scenario three of the
potential rate impacts and benefits as shown in CMR256.

Council Member Schmid questioned the percentage impact with the Smart
Station maintaining the solid-waste processes.

Mr. Roberts stated the net increase would be an additional 13-14 percent on
the rates however it did not appear cost-effective. He stated the percentage
rate impacts included the net analysis.

Mr. Reiser stated the multi-family and commercial solid waste processing
and the single family would be processed on a materials-free recovery line.
He stated the equipment was basically the same as at the Smart Station, so
the solid waste would go to the proposed facility which claimed a 75 percent
recovery rate.

Council Member Schmid noted the 9 percent and 4 percent increases and
pointed out the average increase was midpoint and not the combination of
both increases.

Mr. Roberts stated the net cost to the refuse fund required a 13 percent
increase to accommodate the hauler rate.

HF&H Consultant, Peter Deibler stated the 13 percent increase was added if
both programs were completed at a 13 percent average impact to the rates.

Council Member Schmid asked for clarification on the reported savings
regarding the expanding organic materials.
