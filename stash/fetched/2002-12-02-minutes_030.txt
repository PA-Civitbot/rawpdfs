Council Member Lytle replaced the words, “wherever appropriate” in
Program H-1 and H-3.

Ms. Furth was unclear how program H-3 read.

Council Member Lytle said H-3 read, “Encourage the conversion of
nonresidential lands to residential use to both increase the supply of housing
to residential use at locations identified in the Housing Sites Inventory and
to be identified in the upcoming zoning map and Comprehensive Plan Land
Use Map Amendments as part of the Zoning Ordinance update.” The purpose
was both to increase the supply of housing, particularly affordable housing,
and decrease the potential for the creation of new jobs that exacerbate.
Additional changes were in H-1, H-3, H-4, H-5, H-10, Policy H-3, Policy H-4,
Program H-16, and Program H-51.

Mr. Emslie said none of the land use policies could exist outside the Zoning
Code or the Housing Element. They had to be consistent with the zoning or
have a variance, Planned Community or rezoning. Policies came out of the
Zoning Code Update.

Mr. Ojakian asked whether the Housing Element had to be updated when the
Zoning Code was updated.

Mr. Emslie said no.

Council Member Kleinberg suggested adding an explanatory sentence at the
beginning to be more explicit.

Mr. Emslie said that could be done.

Ms. Furth suggested adding to Policy H-1, “These changes and
redesignations will be implemented through the zoning ordinance update.”

Council Member Lytle asked that the language include both “the zoning
ordinance and the land use map.”

Council Member Freeman asked for a friendly amendment to put the wording
in a more global location.

Mr. Emslie asked that the Council direct staff to fit the wording in to make
the most sense for readability.

Council Member Beecham supported the wording in Goal 1 or in Program H-
1.
