Council Member Scharff agreed that naming an Edward Durell Stone building
after Birge Clark was inappropriate; their styles were disparate. He did not
have a strong preference for either Main or Rinconada. The community

Council Member Berman appreciated public comments regarding the

the logic in naming Main Library for Birge Clark. She expressed regret that
there was a lack of understanding of the City's policy for naming and
renaming facilities.

2014, and the Finance Committee accepted the LRFF. The LRFF marked the
beginning of the Fiscal Year (FY) 2015 Budget planning process. It allowed
Staff and the Council to understand long-term results of past decisions and
