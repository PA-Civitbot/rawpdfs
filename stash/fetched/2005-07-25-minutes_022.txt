Mr. Emslie said it had been the City’s practice to use the general office use as
the trip generation rate. The analysis before the Council complied with that
practice.

Council Member Freeman recommended when staff returned in September
with the LM ZOU, the City’s practice of using the average trip generation rate
should be evaluated. The traffic congestion and the mitigations made after the
fact had been proven time and again.

Mr. Emslie said staff agreed with Council Member Freeman’s comment and
expected it would be part of the analysis that was ongoing with the ZOU.

Council Member Freeman asked whether the MND was in violation of CEQA.

Mr. Larkin said no.

Mr. Emslie concurred.

Council Member Freeman expressed concern about the ingress/egress at
Embarcadero and East Bayshore Roads. She asked if the Watson Court entry
was 900 feet from the traffic light, how many feet was the new ingress from
the traffic light.

Ms. El-Guendy said it was approximately 450 feet.

Council Member Freeman asked approximately how many cars fit into 450
feet.

Ms. El-Guendy said each car took approximately 25 feet. In distributing the
project trip generation, staff assigned a very small number of trips off the
access driveway. Most of the right turn movements were from Watson Court.

Council Member Freeman asked how the assignment of right turn only would
be determined.

Ms. El-Guendy said it was determined by the site plan layout and the number
of parking spaces closest to the access relative to Watson Court.

Council Member Freeman asked whether the ingress or egress had any fire
safety issues associated with it.

Ms. El-Guendy said it was preferable to have two access locations for a site
plan because of emergency services.

Council Member Freeman asked whether it was possible to designate a right
turn only from the driveway.
