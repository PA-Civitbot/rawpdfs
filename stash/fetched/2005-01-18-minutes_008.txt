Sanford Forte, 280 College Avenue, said municipalities gained revenue from
library investment and use.

Elaine Meyer said libraries should be treasured.

Lenore Jones said the Library Advisory Commission had voted unanimously
that the Downtown Library hours be restored on Saturdays.

Council Member Mossar asked whether opening the library temporarily on
Saturdays would be advisable.

Ms. Jones said if library hours needed to be cut, closure hours should be
shared across the library branches.

Mr. Benest said every department would share in service and budget
reductions.

Council Member Morton said Saturday hours were important.

MOTION: Council Member Morton moved, seconded by Freeman, to
approve the Library Advisory Commission (LAC) recommendation that
$35,000 be reallocated from the City Managerâ€™s Contingency Fund to the
Library Department to restore Saturday hours at the Downtown Library.

Council Member Freeman said public libraries were social institutions that
elevated the community knowledge base.

Council Member Kishimoto said the Library Advisory Commission (LAC) had
made it clear that Saturday hours should be restored.

Manager of Library Services Diane Jennings spoke regarding the relocation
of certain collections at the Downtown Library.

Vice Mayor Kleinberg asked staff for clarification of the Service Employees
International Union (SEIU) requirements and whether it could impact
Saturday hours.

Ms. Jennings said it was more difficult to schedule weekends with a seven-
day operation. The Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) stated employees
must have two consecutive days off within a seven-day work week;
however, library employees could choose not to have two consecutive days
off.
