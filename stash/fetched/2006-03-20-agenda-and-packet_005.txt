In order to compensate for the potential loss of parking, the Kenson Group has agreed to enter
into a Parking Covenant that would guarantee compensation to the City for any loss of parking
associated with the expiration of the lease for parking associated with 130 Lytton. The Covenant
would provide for the payment of a fixed fee based on the Property’s share of the remaining
principal balance of the 2001 and 2002 Downtown Parking District Assessment Bonds at the
time the lease is due to expire. This amount is intended to offset the benefit that would otherwise
be received by 130 Lytton for parking spaces that were improperly credited to the property.
Based on 902 total spaces constructed in the district, the payment would be $34,928 per parking
space lost for a total of $2,444,956 for a loss of all 70 spaces. Any payments would be allocated
to the City’s in-lieu parking fund. The covenant would expire on December 31, 2030—the same
year that the Assessment District bonds will be retired—after which the property owners would
have no further obligation under the agreement. This payment appears to be an equitable
solution that will provide the City with some of the funding to pay for alternative parking.

Palo Alto Municipal Code Section 18.49.100(c) allows for Assessment District parking
requirements to be met by off-site parking as long as there is a binding Agreement and
Declaration of Covenant. This Agreement will satisfy the Municipal Code requirements.

RESOURCE IMPACT
This Agreement will have no effect upon the finances of the Assessment District.

POLICY IMPLICATIONS
Kenson Group and the City desire to address the potential future loss of the spaces while
ensuring that the parking requirement is still met. The approach taken is designed for these
unique circumstances and is not designed to set policy for future City actions.

ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW
There are no environmental impacts from entering into this Agreement.
