REPORTS OF OFFICIALS

10.   Approval of Contracts with: 1) Artist Bruce Beasley in the Amount of
      $190,000, and 2) Aaron Garfunkel Landscapes, Inc. in the Amount of
      $35,500, for the Creation and Installation of a New Fountain Replacing
      the Damaged Fountain on California Avenue

Council Member Morton advised that he would not be participating in this
item as his new office was located within 500 feet of the California Avenue
fountain area. He left the meeting at 11:00 p.m.

Linda Craighead, Division Manager for Arts & Sciences, Public Art
Commission Liaison, gave an overview of the fountain project.

Council Member Barton asked what prevention measure would keep the new
fountain area from being backed into by trucks.

Ms. Craighead stated the proposed fountain would sit in the original footprint
and also have setbacks to prevent damage by trucks.

Council Member Espinosa asked if that was the only solution to the truck
problem.

Ms. Craighead stated they could not guarantee this and would have to look
at logistics or other barriers.

Council Member Espinosa acknowledged the hard work that went into this
project proposal. He asked if staff was surprised by the outpouring of
concern by the community regarding the project.

Ms. Craighead stated she was not surprised by public input and comment.
She stated that the three-year ongoing process also kept it in the public eye
and open for remarks. The process was followed through the Public Art
Commission meetings and the public was made aware of the process. She
stated a main concern was whether or not the water feature would remain
and the intention was to keep that in place.

Council Member Espinosa asked if the Public Art Commission saw this as
fountain and not just a piece of art with a water feature.
