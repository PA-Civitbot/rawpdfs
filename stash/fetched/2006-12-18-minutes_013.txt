Council Member Klein said he was confused by the resource impact
statement in the staff report (CMR:426:06), which indicated joining ICLEI
cost $1,200 per year.

Mr. Knapp said in order to be accepted the City would have to do all three
things: 1) apply for membership; 2) pay the fee; and 3) adopt a resolution.
The first two were completed, and staff hoped to obtain the third that
evening.

Council Member Klein asked whether the application was sent with or
without the fee.

Mr. Knapp said the application was sent with the fee, which was within the
spending authority of the City Manager.

Council Member Klein clarified the Council was being asked to agree to the
Campaign’s Five Milestones.

Mr. Knapp said that was correct.

Council Member Klein asked how many cities were members.

Mr. Knapp said he did not know the exact number of cities, but believed it
was in the hundreds.

Mayor Kleinberg said the staff report (CMR:426:06) indicated more than 600
cities worldwide.

MOTION: Council Member Klein moved, seconded by Morton, to support
participation in ICLEI’s Cities for Climate Protection® Campaign and pledges
to undertake the Campaign’s Five Milestones to Reduce Local Greenhouse
Gas Emissions that contribute to global warming.

Council Member Morton believed it was consistent with the Green Ribbon
Task Force (GRTF) report, and a good first step.

Vice Mayor Kishimoto expressed support for the motion. With regard to the
GRTF, she inquired whether the status report due in April 2007 would
include some evaluation of the public/private partnership concept.

Mr. Knapp said one of the GRTF’s recommendations specifically addressed
incorporating a public/private partnership.

MOTION PASSED 9-0.
