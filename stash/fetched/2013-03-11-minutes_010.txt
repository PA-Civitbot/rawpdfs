Ms. Weiss replied neither.

Mr. Bobel stated bags currently being used were plastic. Eventually food
scraps would be placed in compostable plastic bags; however, Staff was
struggling with the type of container to be used for other kinds of garbage.

Mayor Scharff inquired about the meaning of dynamic tests as part of
durability standards.

Ms. Weiss explained a dynamic test measured durability using simulation of
actual usage.

Mr. Bobel stated the bag was tested through stress.

Mayor Scharff asked if durability standards would prevent usage of low-
quality bags.

Ms. Weiss indicated durability standards would allow consumers to move
away from low-quality bags.

Mayor Scharff inquired whether the low-quality bag Ms. Weiss demonstrated
met EcoLogo standards.

Ms. Weiss did not believe it would.

Mayor Scharff inquired whether the Ordinance would require that bags
indicate they met EcoLogo standards.

Ms. Weiss reported the proposed Ordinance required quite a bit of
information to be placed on the bottom of bags.

Mayor Scharff referenced the information required to be printed on bags, but
did not find a requirement for the EcoLogo standard.

Ms. Weiss noted that was not required but could be included as a
requirement.

Mayor Scharff expressed concerns about the amount of information required
to be printed on bags, stating that would not benefit anyone and could cause
less reusing of bags.
