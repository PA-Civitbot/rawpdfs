She suggested changing it to PC housing projects that might include a
small retail or non-profit social component of 1,500 square feet or
greater.

Council Member Kishimoto asked whether it must have a retail or
social service component.
Council Member Freeman said it was not a cap. The 1,250 square feet
average unit size was derived from the chart in the answers from staff.
She suggested another amendment that would make it 100 percent
rather than 120 percent.

Council Member Kishimoto said she did not know the right answer.
Council Member Kleinberg had suggested a number around 1,500
square feet or what staff would recommend.

Council Member Freeman asked whether that needed to be known
before the Council voted.

Council Member Kleinberg said that was no size limit on the units that
were in the 100 percent affordable projects.

Council Member Kishimoto clarified that was on the small retail and
social service components.

Vice Mayor Beecham said Council Member Kishimoto could ask staff to
return with a definition. Staff should confirm the 1,500 square feet
was realistic or make another recommendation.

Council Member Freeman asked whether the Council would vote on
whatever staff recommended as small.

Council Member Kishimoto said Council would be voting on the
Ordinance.

Council Member Kleinberg asked whether PC zones that were 100
percent rental or social service, included mixed uses. She said there
might be a social service component to a senior citizen housing unit
that was 100 percent including some compatible internal serving uses.

Council Member Kishimoto said a mixed-use building could include a
100 percent rental with some social services.
