     DISCUSSION:
     The proposed project involves minor construction activities within the public right-of-way that is
     located within a fully developed and previously disturbed area. The proposed project will not create
     any cultural impacts to the affected area. For all projects, if during grading and construction activities,
     any archaeological or human remains are encountered, construction shall cease and a qualified
     archaeologist shall visit the site to address the find. The Santa Clara County Medical Examiner’s
     office shall be notified to provide proper direction on how to proceed. If any Native American
     resources are encountered during construction, construction shall cease immediately until a Native
     American descendant, appointed by the Native American Heritage Commission of the State of
     California, is able to evaluate the site and make further recommendations and be involved in
     mitigation planning.

     Mitigation Measures: None Required
