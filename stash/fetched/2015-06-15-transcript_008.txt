Mayor Holman: We'll turn to the public hearing portion of the item. The
Council conducted its first public hearing on the budget and utility rate
changes on June 8, last week. Tonight we'll conduct our second and final
hearing on the budget and related items. A portion of this hearing will be
related to changes in wastewater and refuse rates, and this portion of the
hearing is governed by Prop 218. Would the City Attorney like to give us
some background on 218, please?

Molly Stump, City Attorney: Thank you, Mayor Holman. City Attorney Molly
Stump. The procedure for tonight's refuse and wastewater changes follows
the requirement of California Constitution Proposition 218, which was
adopted by the voters in 1996.        It sets forth procedures that local
governments must follow when they increase property-related fees. Our
Supreme Court has said that both of these types of fees are subject to the
Prop 218 procedural rules. The public has received notice of these potential
rate increases, and the Council needs to hold the public hearing, which
closes with the majority protest procedure. If 50 percent plus one of the
affected property owners opposes or protests the rate increases, then they
cannot be imposed tonight or adopted by the Council. Thank you.

Mayor Holman: Before I begin the public hearing, there's a process for this
portion of the hearing. All residents and other interested persons will have
an opportunity to speak and provide testimony this evening either
