The draft Housing Element as revised was circulated on September 18,
2014. The 30-day review period for the Mitigated Negative Declaration
began August 29 and ended September 30, 2014. No rezoning was required
for any of the sites contained in the housing inventory. On October 1, 2014,
the Planning and Transportation Commission (P&TC) recommended adoption
of the draft Housing Element.         On October 9, 2014, the RHMC also
recommended approval with some revisions. Those revisions were included
in the Staff Report and, if approved, would be incorporated into the Public
Hearing draft.       On October 30, 2014, the Community Panel also
recommended approval of the Public Hearing draft but without revisions
proposed by the RHMC.

Ms. Gitelman clarified that the Resolution prepared for Council included
revisions recommended by the RHMC.

Council Member Schmid, Chair of the Regional Housing Mandate Committee,
advised that the RHMC received valuable input from the Community Panel,
housing advocates, the public, and HCD. Because the Council approved the
2006-2014 Housing Element in 2013, many sites identified in that Housing
Element had not been utilized and were eligible to be carried over to the
2015-2023 Housing Element.       Staff identified sites zoned for housing;
therefore, rezoning was not necessary. In June 2014, the Council directed
inclusion of the statement that the City would continue to review sites for
denser housing. The draft Housing Element responded to the mandate given
the City at the end of 2013. The RHMC proposed additional changes, which
the Community Panel did not approve. First, the RHMC proposed changing
"amend the Zoning Code" to "consider amending the Zoning Code" to specify
minimum density.        Secondly, the RHMC proposed deleting setback
modifications as one of six examples from Program H2.1.9. Thirdly, the
RHMC proposed adding "There is concern that the commercial developers
are not paying an equitable share."

Public Hearing opened at 9:11 P.M.

Phyllis Cassel, League of Women Voters of Palo Alto, supported the City's
efforts to provide more diverse and affordable housing for all income groups
and was pleased with the draft Housing Element. Housing sites were not
always located within walking distance to transit and services; however, the
Council had recognized the need to identify promising sites in such areas.

Public Hearing closed at 9:13 P.M.
