City Clerk Donna Rogers responded that tapes were kept for six months, but
she would keep that specific meeting tape for a longer period of time.

Vice Mayor Mossar shared Council Member Burch’s concern. The minutes
were supposed to be sense minutes. The City Clerk’s office was asked about
the length of time necessary to make changes to the October 7, 2002,
meeting. Among three staff people, approximately four and one half hours
were spent on the corrections.

Council Member Kishimoto asked that corrections be made to the minutes of
October 7, 2002, because she was liaison to the South of Forest Area (SOFA)
Working Group.

Council Member Freeman asked whether the Mayor or City Clerk wanted to
present to the public what sense minutes meant.

Ms. Rogers explained that sense minutes were between verbatim and action
minutes. Action minutes included only the motion; verbatim minutes were
every word spoken. The City Clerk’s staff tried to summarize the essence of
the points being made.

Council Member Freeman said verbatim minutes were requested when there
was a particularly sensitive issue that needed to be in the record. Vice Mayor
Mossar set the precedent earlier in the year.

Vice Mayor Mossar had no recollection of ever requesting verbatim
comments placed in the record and asked her colleague to make the
information off line available to her.

Council Member Freeman said she would do that.

Council Member Morton asked whether the Council would approve only
sense minutes unless the Council instructed the City Clerk to prepare
verbatim minutes.

Ms. Rogers said she would only do sense minutes unless she received
direction from a majority of the Council telling her not to.
