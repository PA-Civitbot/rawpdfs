Council Member Morton said it was a plan and queried if the element
needed to be moved from the plan. The authorization of funding was
not being made.

Ms. Furth said it talked about assigning priorities and ranking projects.
Everything but the Stanford Plan could be acted on because it was a
document and no one was being regulated.

Vice Mayor Beecham said he wanted to modify his motion to include
the Transit Center under medium priorities, which referred to the
Stanford Research Park. He moved for approval for everything except
anything referencing Stanford assets.

Mayor Mossar said the motion would be to approve the staff
recommendation with no implicit ruling on any project having to do
with Stanford University; specifically, items having to do with the
Research Park and the Intermodal Center.

Council Member Morton said Attachment A of CMR:378:03 lacked
detail.

Mr. Kott said the baseline data collection had not been finished.

Council Member Morton said the at-grade crossings were a much
bigger priority.

Mayor Mossar requested to include in the motion to direct staff to
prepare a letter to be signed by the Mayor to the Valley Transportation
Authority (VTA) Board and Santa Clara County (SCC) Cities Association
stating strong interest in VTA furthering projects that were promised
by previously passed sales tax measures and the concern that current
planning processes were favoring other projects to the disadvantage of
the community.

Council Member Morton said he would be willing to incorporate that.

Council Member Freeman said the plan would take time to go through
and questioned if it was just a general idea.

Mr. Kott said the Transportation Manager would return to Council when
the City engaged in a project. Council had decision points, which were
specific to each project and gave guidance to staff.
