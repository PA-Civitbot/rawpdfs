Mr. Bobel reported the Development Manager attended a meeting with the
California Avenue Business Association in June 2014. Several members also
emailed Staff.

Council Member Schmid noted the Ordinance stated smoking was prohibited
in commercial areas. Commercial areas as defined in the Ordinance were
large areas. He asked if employees in commercial areas would have to leave
the area in order to smoke.

Ms. Struve advised that business owners could propose smoking areas that
were at least 25 feet away from an opening.

Council Member Schmid asked if any business owner could propose a
smoking area.

Ms. Struve indicated business owners in the commercial area would need to
make one proposal as the smoking area would likely be on City property.

Mr. Bobel would work with business associations in Downtown and California
Avenue and Stanford Shopping Center to determine designated smoking
areas.

Council Member Schmid noted the Ordinance stated a shopping center could
establish a designated smoking area, and asked if that included smaller
commercial sites.

Mr. Bobel referred to the change in the at-places memo which would include
any commercial area covered by the smoking ban.          It would include
neighborhood commercial centers.

Council Member Schmid asked if Staff would work individually with those
groups.

Mr. Bobel would contact the small shopping centers.

Council Member Schmid was thinking of Charleston Center, where the only
neighboring site was Cubberley Community Center. The City did not want to
establish a smoking area at Cubberley.

Ms. Struve believed smoking was banned at Cubberley as it was a park. It
would be difficult to establish a designated smoking area at Charleston
Center because of the 25-foot buffer zone.

Council Member Schmid asked if Staff would work individually with each
area.
