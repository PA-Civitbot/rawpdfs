                               2017 STATE OF THE CITY

                                   Mayor Greg Scharff

                                     February 8, 2017




Good evening, everyone. I’m Greg Scharff and I have the privilege of again serving as

Mayor of Palo Alto this year. I want to welcome and thank all of you for coming out this

evening to be part of this important annual tradition in the life of our community.




I want to extend a special welcome to all of you who are Palo Alto community members;

to our neighbors; to my fellow Council members and other elected officials; to all who

serve on boards, commissions and committees; and to members of the press. Each of

you by your presence here this evening demonstrates that you care greatly about our

city. Before I get started, I want to take a moment to recognize and welcome our three

newest Councilmembers who were recently elected this past fall, Lydia Kou, Greg

Tanaka and Adrian Fine. Please give them a round of applause.




And welcome to HanaHaus.         This creative transformation of a beloved community

building is a collaborative workspace where innovation occurs on a daily basis. I chose

Hana Haus as the location for tonight’s State of the City address because it symbolizes

many of the qualities that make Palo Alto an amazing community.
