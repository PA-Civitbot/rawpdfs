Aaron Aknin, Acting Director of Planning and Community Environment,
reported Staff recommended the Council not proceed with Section 2d of the
proposed Ordinance related to the grandfather status, which uses facilities to
clarify that a grandfathered use may be remodeled and improved, but may
not be replaced and maintain its grandfathered status. After meeting with
the City Attorney, Staff believed additional review was necessary and would
return with a recommendation. In the Downtown area, the Exempt Floor
Area Ordinance allowed properties to build an amount of square footage
equal to the lot size without providing parking. Approximately one year ago,
the Council enacted a moratorium on use of the Ordinance, which would
expire at the end of December 2013. Staff recommended the Ordinance be
permanently deleted from the Municipal Code. The Ordinance applied to a
lesser degree to California Avenue.        The Planning and Transportation
Commission (PTC) recommended the Ordinance be permanently deleted.
The Minor Floor Area Exemption was a 200-square-foot exemption applied to
any property that was not eligible for a historic or seismic rehabilitation
bonus. Staff recommended deletion of the exemption for the two-year
interim period in order to study potential impacts. Transfer of Development
Rights (TDR) sites were eligible for either historic or seismic rehabilitation.
With rehabilitation, property owners were allowed a 2,500-square-foot bonus
onsite for either category to build floor area beyond the amount allowed
under current Code provisions without providing parking.                  Staff
recommended elimination of the parking exemption associated with the floor
area bonus. Transfer of rights to a receiver site would be allowed for the
