Council Member Yeh stated bicyclists are forced onto the sidewalk near
Charleston Avenue. He stated preserving the heritage trees and the current
use of the sidewalk from bicycles could potentially create a dangerous
situation.

Mr. Williams stated he would have City engineers look at incorporating
safety measures in regards to signage for bicyclists.

Council Member Yeh stated in the event there was overflow parking, where
would overflow parking potentially exist.

Mr. Williams stated there are two landscape reserve spaces that could be
built out if there is a parking issue.

Council Member Yeh inquired what would trigger the buildout of the reserve
parking spaces.

Mr. Williams stated if Staff heard about a problem with overflow parking,
Staff would go back to the developer and require them to build out the two
spaces. He stated there was no other specific plan for overflow parking,
which was the case for similar projects.

Council Member Yeh inquired if overflow parking complaints would come
from residents or neighbors of the Project.

Mr. Williams stated complaints would potentially come from either source.
He stated parking would be monitored by Staff and potentially heritage trees
may need to be removed in order to build upon the parking lot.

Council Member Yeh inquired on the potential subsidy cost the City pays for
affordable housing units. He inquired on how typical the Projectâ€™s funding
structure was.

Mr. Williams stated the funding structure is fairly typical. He stated there
may be ten to twelve different funding sources for the construction of a low
income housing project.

Council Member Yeh inquired on the cost to the City of Palo Alto for this
Project.

Mr. Williams stated $2.8 million. He stated the cost comes from Community
Development Block Grant funds and was not General Fund or Housing
Funds.
