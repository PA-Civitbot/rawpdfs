Mr. Roberts said the concept had been explored when site alternatives were
being reviewed.    There were major utility conflicts existing on Forest
Avenue.

Vice Mayor Burch commented it would be prohibitively expensive.

Mr. Roberts confirmed. The logistics were prohibitive.

Mayor Beecham asked whether it would be too expensive if only the surface
was built on and no underground parking was included.

Mr. Roberts confirmed.  There was a utility governed by Interstate
Commerce Commission regulations, which required access.

Council Member Kleinberg said she was concerned with the responsibility to
provide excellent public safety services to the community.

Council Member Freeman said there was a lot of money already invested and
the issue should go forward. She was concerned about spending more
money on the design when the City did not have $43 million for
construction.

Ms. Harrison said it was unknown how much it would cost until there was a
30 percent design.

Ms. Johnson said Council had approved the $275,000 in the previous Capital
Improvement Program (CIP).

Ms. Harrison said $800,000 had already been allocated.

Council Member Freeman said she had concerns about daylight planes, and
when the information would be provided to Council.

Mr. Roberts said the daylight planes would be developed at the 30 percent
design stage and the zone change process.

Council Member Freeman asked whether approval of further investigation
gave the go ahead to increase the height limitation.

Mr. Roberts said it did not.

Mayor Beecham said Council was providing conceptual direction to develop
further plans for Council to review.

Council Member Freeman said the height issue was a major concern.
