developed in the community meetings, including the Arborist’s report. He
stated the City had a specially-designed webpage on the Plan.

Mr. Keene spoke on the difficult budget decisions made last year. This
project was an unbudgeted and unplanned Capital Improvement Project. He
indicated that at least $50,000 had been spent on Staff time supporting the
community process. It was his belief additional time spent on this project
took away from community programs.
