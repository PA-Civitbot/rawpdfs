Council Member Espinosa asked regarding bench marking for other Cities on
this last point and what we saw in the Bay Area for other jurisdictions who
have lowered this down to a three-unit threshold.

Mr. Emslie stated it was estimated that about 30 percent of jurisdictions that
had BMR inclusionary housing requirements have applied fees or dedication
of units at five or fewer. We would be par with about 30 percent of the Cities
that did inclusionary housing.

MOTION: Council Member Schmid moved, seconded by Council Member
Kishimoto to direct Staff to study Policy # 1.I.1. which reads â€œConsultants
found that in-lieu fees are a financial benefit to the developer and that the
methodology needs further adjustment to bring those fees in-line with
development costs.

Mr. Baum asked for clarification whether that was direction to Staff to study
and return to Council.

Mayor Klein stated it should be direction to Staff to study the issue and
return with it.

Mr. Emslie stated it was in the overall recommendation to return with that.

Council Member Morton asked whether the Council was asking Staff to
return and provide us with their opinion on whether or not converting to a
complete in-lieu fee program was advisable.

Mr. Emslie stated the consultants had recommended that the in-lieu fee was
too low.

Council Member Morton stated the in-lieu fee was seven percent and for the
larger developments they would be paying 15 percent or more. We are
asking Staff to return with a proper level of the in-lieu fee.

Council Member Espinosa asked for clarification whether this was already in
the plan.

Mr. Emslie stated it was but Council comments were always welcome on any
Staff recommendation.
