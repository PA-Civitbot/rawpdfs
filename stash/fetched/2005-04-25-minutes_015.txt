Mr. Emslie said the application had been submitted, but he was unsure
whether the project was complete.

Vice Mayor Kleinberg asked if that would be a 100 percent BMR unit that had
its application received by the City.

Mr. Baum said the application had not been deemed as complete.

Mr. Emslie said he did not have that information.

Council Member Freeman asked the number of 100 percent BMR applications
that had been received and how the change in revenue would impact the
budget.

Ms. Harrison said staff was not prepared to answer the questions as the
speaker had just raised the question that evening.

Council Member Freeman said she needed further information.

Vice Mayor Kleinberg said large fees would impact a non-profit developer.

Council Member Morton said impacts on non-profit groups would be
discussed by the Finance Committee in June and should not be voted on that
evening.
