ORAL COMMUNICATIONS

Todd Burke discussed the California Avenue project. He said he lived on
California Avenue, and was President of the Homeowners' Association at Palo
Alto Central. The Board voted to support the streetscape project. He
appreciated Staff working with the community, and saw a number of
benefits including a lane change. He wanted to find a middle ground with
the businesses, and a way to work with those in extreme disagreement with
the project. Staff had run a good campaign to include all residents and
businesses.

Howard Hoffman called on the City Council to place on the ballot a measure
to institute a 5 cents per gallon tax on gasoline and diesel fuel. Palo Alto
had an opportunity to set an example for the County of Santa Clara, for all
of California, and all of the United States. Any increase in the fuel tax would
encourage Palo Alto residents to further reduce their consumption of gas and
diesel. Most economists and environmentalists would rally to support such a
ballot measure.
