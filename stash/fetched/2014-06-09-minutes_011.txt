Mayor Shepherd advised that this was the time and place for the Public
Hearing on the public assessment rolls for the California Avenue Parking
Assessment District Number 92-13, Resolution of Intent Number 7230
adopted August 9, 1993. The City Engineer caused to be prepared and filed
with the City Clerk a report providing for the levy of special assessments
within the California Avenue Parking Assessment District. The report set
forth the amount of assessments proposed to be levied for Fiscal Year 2014-
2015. The assessments would be used to pay principal and interest on the
bonds issued for the Assessment District. The report was and had been
open for public inspection. The purpose of the hearing was to allow the
Council to hear all persons having an interest in any real property within the
Parking Assessment District; to hear all objections, protests or other written
communications from any such interested persons; to take and receive oral
and documentary evidence pertaining to matters contained in the filed
report; to remedy and correct any error or informality in the report and to
amend, alter, modify, correct, and confirm the report and each of the
assessments therein. She inquired whether the City Clerk had received any
written communication from any such interested persons.
