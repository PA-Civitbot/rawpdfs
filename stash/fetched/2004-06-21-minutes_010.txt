Council Member Ojakian asked Mr. Steinberg whether the plan was an all-
residential project.

Mr. Steinberg confirmed.

Council Member Ojakian asked whether retail had been considered.

Mr. Solit said it had been considered, but the elements of hotel and retail
would have created a mixed-use project.
Council Member Ojakian asked Mr. Solit what the problem would be.

Mr. Solit said when there was a mix of uses, there would need to be a site
and design review which would need to go through all of the elements of
Palo Alto’s review and process.

Council Member Ojakian asked Mr. Solit whether there were plans to plant
trees along El Camino Real.

Mr. Steinberg said he would like the presentation of trees in their project on
El Camino Real, which would contribute to the City’s benefit as well as the
homeowners.

Council Member Ojakian asked whether there were plans for outdoor
amenities, such as a park.

Mr. Steinberg said both public and private open space was being shown.

Council Member Morton asked whether there were remaining facts that the
Council should be made aware of.

Mr. Solit said there were no elements over 35-feet, there would not be a
driveway off Charleston Avenue, and there would be single-family residential
along Wilkie Way frontage.

Mr. Steinberg said there was sensitivity to adjacent properties.

Council Member Cordell asked Mr. Steinberg whether he saw a problem if
the driveway were limited to emergency ingress and egress.

Mr. Solit said he was always ready to manage the traffic of the driveway so
there would be no significant impact.

Council Member Cordell asked if the driveway were limited to emergency
access, whether he saw a problem with the development.
