            DRAFT ACTION MINUTES
Vice Mayor Scharff encouraged Council Members to attend the Santa Clara
County Healthy Cities Conference. He reported that he will sit on a panel
discussing tobacco during the Conference.

Council Member DuBois clarified that his understanding of Council’s intent
for Scenario 5 of the Comprehensive Plan Update would be to analyze a
scenario with fewer jobs, not simply less office space. He expressed concern
that this distinction may not have been communicated to the City’s
consultants.

Council Member Holman supported Council Member DuBois’ understanding
of Council’s intent regarding Scenario 5.

James Keene, City Manager reported that the Council will hear an Agenda
Item pertaining to the Land Use Element of the Comprehensive Plan Update.
He believes that would be the time do discuss these clarifications.

Council Member DuBois wanted to make sure consultant time was not
wasted studying an incorrect scenario.

Mayor Burt reported that he was joined by Council Members Berman,
DuBois, Holman, and Schmid at the City’s second Veterans Day Recognition
Event. Lieutenant General Rex C. McMillian, Commander of Marine Forces
Reserve and Marine Forces North was the featured speaker at the event. He
felt the event was meaningful and successful. He reported the success of
the United Nations Association (UNA) Film Festival and expressed his hope
that the City can partner with UNA in support of future film festivals.

Adjournment: The meeting was adjourned at 10:44 P.M.
