Council Member Berman attended a joint event hosted by the Art Center and
Rinconada Library. The public art located between the two buildings was
brilliant.

Council Member Scharff was elected Vice President of the Santa Clara
County Cities Association for the upcoming year.

Council Member Price requested Staff work with the Human Relations
Commission (HRC), other cities, and nonprofit agencies to convene a summit
of innovative homelessness programs and partnerships including, but not
limited to, the Santa Barbara Safe Parking Program and the San Francisco
Mobile Shower Units.

Molly Stump, City Attorney, explained that Council Members could request
an item be placed on the Council's Agenda to consider directions to Staff to
perform the work.

Council Member Klein suggested Council Member Price limit her proposal to
a general statement.

Ms. Stump agreed that a broader description of an Agenda Item was often
better. Staff would retain Council Member Price's proposal as notes for the
item. A broader description would allow for more ideas to be brought
forward.

Council Member Burt asked if a Motion was permitted in the current item.

Ms. Stump responded no.     Council Members could agendize an item for a
future discussion.

Mayor Shepherd asked if there was support for the concept.

Council Member    Schmid    supported   a   broad   Agenda   Item   regarding
homelessness.

Ms. Stump explained that the proposal was an oral Colleagues' Memo to
place on a future Agenda a discussion of issues related to homelessness,
county services, and related matters.

Mayor Shepherd inquired whether support by two Council Members was
sufficient to agendize an item.

Ms. Stump replied yes. Staff would shape an Agenda Item that would allow
a broad discussion.
