Mayor Drekmeier stated expanding the Board of Directors for the Farmshop
may be beneficial.      He indicated a steering committee consisting of
community groups, such as Green Fork, Collective Roots, Common Group,
and Avenidas could be formed. He stated a bill insert and posters may be
effective in promoting the Farmshop. He spoke on contracts between local
restaurants and Capay Valley Growers to provide fresh produce, and inviting
additional farmers to participate in the Farmshop.

Council Member Kishimoto thanked IDEO for their role in starting the
Farmshop. She felt the City may have played too large of a role in the
launch of the Farmshop, and it could have been more successful if a
community-based group led its launch.

Mayor Drekmeier thanked Kathleen Pradraski for bringing entertainment and
special activities to the Farmshop.
