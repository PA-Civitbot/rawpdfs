SPECIAL ORDERS OF THE DAY

2.    Presentation About 2009 Senior Games

Anne Cribbs spoke about the 2009 Senior Games coming to Palo Alto in
August 2009. She stated that 13,500 athletes over the age of 50 from
around the country would be competing in 18 medal sports and 7
demonstration sports in and around the Bay Area. The Senior Games are
held every two years and everyone has to qualify at their state games. This
event is free to the athletes and to the public to attend. The event will also
include a torch relay with a sustainable torch. This will be a green event,
where the use of organic food, limited waste, and each athlete will be given
their own water bottle. She spoke about requesting a financial buy-in from
the City, a total investment cost of $500,000.00.

Steve Player spoke about the importance of lifelong fitness and health and
the success of the Games in Palo Alto.

Susie Thom spoke of the opportunity for sustainability education for the
participants and guests who will be experiencing the Palo Alto difference and
she hopes the knowledge will be taken back to their cities.

Vice Mayor Drekmeier asked whether there was a vision involved with the
event for the hotels in the area to move up their green program
commitments.
