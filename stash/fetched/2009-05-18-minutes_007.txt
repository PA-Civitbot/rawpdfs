8C. (Former No. 5) Utilities Advisory Commission Recommendation to
     Approve Changes to the ProjectPLEDGE Program.

Council Member Klein stated concern with the overhead costs outweighing
the size of the program and questioned the plausibility of referring the
persons in need of the program to another agency.

Director of Utilities, Valerie Fong stated the program had not been marketed
or advertised. The object was to gain participation in donors and
participants.

Assistant Director of Utilities Customer Service, Tom Auzenne stated the
program had operated on an Ad Hoc basis since 1996 and had supported
the least financially secure portions of the community.

MOTION: Council Member Burt moved, seconded by Council Member Yeh
to direct Staff to approve changes to the ProjectPLEDGE customer financial
assistance program.

Council Member Yeh stated due to the current economic conditions there
may be an increase in participation.

INCORPORTATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER for Staff to do more marketing for the program
and report back to Council in a year of the success or failure of participation
by both donors and recipients, and overhead administrative costs of the
program.

Council Member Kishimoto asked the number of participants in the Rate
Assistance Program (RAP) program.

Mr. Auzenne stated the RAP program was designed for long term support
for chronic finance conditions and ProjectPLEDGE was designed for unique
occurrences. He stated the participation in the ProjectPLEDGE program
varied between twenty-five to fifty participants whereas there was currently
2,500 on the RAP program.

Council Member Kishimoto asked how RAP was paid for.

Mr. Auzenne stated the RAP program was paid for through the rate payers.

Council Member Espinosa asked for information on the costs for the
marketing program.
