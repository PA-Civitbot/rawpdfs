                        e) Lack of a Second. If there is no second stated immediately, the
                        Mayor should ask whether there is a second. If no Council Member
                        seconds the motion the matter will not be considered.

                        f) Discussion. The maker shall be the first Council Member
                        recognized to speak on the motion if it receives a second. Generally
                        Council Members will speak only once with respect to a motion. If
                        the Mayor or Council permits any Council Member to speak more
                        than once on a motion, all Council Members shall receive the same
                        privilege.

                        g) Secondary Motions. Secondary motions may be made by a
                        Council Member upon getting the floor.




                                                                                                                     Attachment: 2.15.11 (1422 : Policy and Services Agenda 2/15/2011)
                        h) Action. After discussion is complete the Council will vote on the
                        motion under consideration.

                3. Precedence of Motions. When a motion is before the Council, no new
                main motion shall be entertained. The Council recognizes the following
                secondary motions which may be considered while a main motion is
                pending. These motions shall have precedence in the order listed below.
                This means that a secondary motion that is higher on the list will be
                considered ahead of a pending secondary motion that is lower on the list:

                        a)   Fix the time to which to adjourn;
                        b)   Adjourn;
                        c)   Take a recess;
                        d)   Raise a question of privilege;
                        e)   Lay on the table;
                        f)   Previous question (close debate);
                        g)   Limit or extend limits of debate;
                        h)   Motion to continue to a certain time;
                        i)   Refer to committee;
                        j)   Amend or substitute;

                4. Secondary Motions Defined. The purpose of the allowed secondary
                motions is summarized in the following text and table.

                        a) Fix the time to which to adjourn. This motion sets a time for
                        continuation of the meeting. It requires a second, is amendable and
                        is debatable only as to the time to which the meeting is adjourned.

                              b) Adjourn. This motion ends the meeting or adjourns it to another
                              time. It requires a second and is not debatable except to set the time
                              to which the meeting is adjourned, if applicable. A motion to
                              adjourn shall be in order at any time, except as follows: (a) when
