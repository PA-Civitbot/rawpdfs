MOTION PASSED 8-1 for Item Nos. 5, 6 and 8, Freeman no.

Council Member Freeman stated her reasons for voting “no” on Item No. 5:
1) the contract allowed the contractor to provide information on space for a
recycling facility. The identification of the facility had not been vetted fully
and needed a policy prior to spending the money; 2) the $15,534 meeting
listed in Exhibit “C”, Budget Schedule, Task 4, needed discussion, 3) the
$23,245 for Additional Services needed clarification; and 4) the relationship
between contractors and sub-contractors needed clarification.

Council Member Freeman stated regarding Item No. 6, non-professional
agreements needed to go out for bid to attain lower prices.

Council Member Freeman stated regarding Item 8, the Finance Committee’s
$70,000 recommended reappropriation of fees and completion of Downtown
North needed clarification.
