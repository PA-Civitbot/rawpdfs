Mr. Tanczos said one option was shared generators on sites to ensure the
sites remained operable for cell site and backhaul equipment. His company
had a 24/7 operation center to monitor all sites for service outages.

Council Member Schmid inquired if fiber optics had an advantage in an
emergency situation.

Mr. Tanczos indicated fiber optics was a better option for everyone for a
number of reasons.

Mayor Yeh noted the DAS solution was not ideal from many perspectives. In
the hybrid model shown in the presentation reflected an overlapping area for
the City Hall and Hopkins sites. He inquired about expanding the East
Meadow and Hanover coverage areas to reduce the number of DAS sites
needed.

Mr. Tanczos said that could be undertaken. The design presented was only
one option. The biggest challenge was the lack of space for a tower at the
Maybell Avenue site. Other options including private roof tops were not
feasible; therefore, small cell solutions were located there.

Mayor Yeh asked if the Maybell Avenue site was a DAS location.

Mr. Tanczos stated the Maybell Avenue substation did not have adequate
ground space for a tower, and that was the location of the large cluster of
DAS nodes.

Mayor Yeh was agreeable to increasing tower height to reduce the number of
DAS applications. He asked about current and anticipated coverage for Palo
Alto Hills, since it was not included in the map.

Mr. Tanczos did not have that information with him, but he could generate
it.

Mr. Williams reported the topography was not conducive to coverage, and
finding a tower site would be difficult.

Mayor Yeh inquired whether carriers would submit a coverage map to the
company constructing towers at substations.

Mr. Tanczos reported teams from the carrier and construction company
would work to construct coverage maps and ensure assumptions matched.
