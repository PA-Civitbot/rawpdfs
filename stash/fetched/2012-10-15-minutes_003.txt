Stephanie Munoz, spoke regarding developments and the consideration of
over five-story buildings.

Rob Moore, spoke regarding 1095 Channing Avenue and he also experienced
noise and traffic as previously noted by Ms. Vrhel.

Irene Kane, spoke regarding 1095 Channing Avenue and her support of
comments by Ms. Vrhel. Alternative routes should be set including the
encouragement of carpooling. It is not fair that the neighbors on Channing
would absorb all the traffic for this application.
