Mayor Beecham asked how the Redwood trees would affect the Council’s
decision that evening.

Mr. Dockter said they would not.

Mr. Emslie said the trees had been cut prior to the Tree Ordinance.

Council Member Freeman asked about the legal perspective.

Mr. Emslie said the trees were cut prior to the City regulating trees. The
City Arborist needed to interpret how to apply the City’s Tree Ordinance with
the current site condition.      It would not affect the approval of the
subdivision.

Council Member Freeman asked for clarification that a subdivision could be
approved that could not have a cul-de-sac because of protected Redwood
trees.

Mr. Baum said the Redwood trees were no longer viable and would probably
be replaced.

Mr. Dockter confirmed.

Council Member Kleinberg asked for explanation of the setbacks.

Mr. Turner said the Santa Clara County Water District (SCCWD) easement
was 52 feet and the rear yard setback had a no-build easement.

Council Member Kleinberg said 52 feet was the easement.

Mr. Turner confirmed.

Council Member Kleinberg asked the City Attorney if the Council voted in
favor of the motion, could the Council vote on another motion, which would
indicate approval of a lesser project.

Mr. Baum said it would be more efficient to make a substitute motion and
redesign and meet all the findings.

Council Member Kleinberg asked what if the majority of the Council agreed
and one of the findings could not be made.

Mr. Baum said if there were changes, which would allow the project to meet
a finding that should be completed first.
