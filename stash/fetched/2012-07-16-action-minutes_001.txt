honored and excited to be on board as the Project Safety Net (PSN) Director
and has been in the position for three months. She stated she has conducted
an internal and external audit including PSN Steering Committee members
and members at large as well as community members. The three findings
were general themes to work on this year: 1) strengthen the partnership
and collaborative relationship with PAUSD at all levelsâ€”administrative and
site; 2) engage and empower youth in PSN; 3) balance and maintain the
dual but related efforts of the suicide prevention and Developmental asset
work of PSN. Council Member Burt asked about upcoming actions and Ms.
Llerena stated they were creating a youth-focused QPR/Suicide Prevention
