MOTION: Council Member Freeman moved, Cordell seconded, to do a web-
based survey to assess the level of public support.

upgrade storm drains in the future.

residents would be willing to pay $12 versus $10.

Vice Mayor Burch felt it would be difficult to provide adequate information on
a web-based survey.

Council Member Mossar said it was important to be decisive and clear when
putting an item on the ballot.

Committee, and the neighborhood groups would be a place to start the
education process.
