12.   Request to Preliminarily Approve 2003-04 Reappropriation Requests

Mayor Beecham stated he would not participate in the item due to a conflict
of interest because his residence was within 500 feet in proximity.

Vice Mayor Burch recommended dividing the agenda item into two motions.

MOTION: Council Member Kleinberg moved, seconded by Cordell, to
approve the 2003-2004 reappropriation requests that do not include the
Downtown North and Lytton traffic calming expenditures and the Parking
District Educational Brochure.

Council Member Kleinberg said staff and the Finance Committee evaluated
the items carried forward.

MOTION PASSED 9-0.

Chop Keenan, 700 Emerson Street, asked for the second half of the color
brochure funding in order to print it.

Barbara Gross, 122 Hamilton Avenue, read a letter from John Barton,
Chairman of the Board of the Palo Alto Chamber of Commerce, encouraging
the Council to fully fund the brochure.

Roxy Rapp, 261 Lytton Avenue, said property owners and leaders of the
Parking Committee authorized the money to be spent to educate the
community and out of town visitors.

Council Member Kleinberg said the Finance Committee did not feel the
brochure was ready to be reprinted if there were outstanding Downtown
improvements.

Director of Administrative Services Carl Yeats said it would be difficult to
correlate direct sales tax revenue to street parking.

Council Member Kleinberg said the Finance Committee had concerns about
enhancing the opportunities for individuals to shop Downtown for an extra
hour.

MOTION: Council Member Kleinberg moved, seconded by Morton, to
approve the reappropriation of $43,000 for the Parking District Educational
Brochure.

Council Member Kleinberg said there was a willingness of the business
community to review and improve the signage for color zones.
