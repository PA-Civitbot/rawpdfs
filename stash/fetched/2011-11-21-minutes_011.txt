Council Member Shepherd asked Mr. Keene if he meant to reduce the
contingency officially and publicly.


Mr. Keene said yes.    The Council could set contingencies as data came in
and could set a target date of when changes should be made.


Council Member Shepherd asked how about in December.


Mr. Keene stated he would follow the Councilâ€™s direction.


City Attorney, Molly Stump advised that the item before the Council was to
receive a report.      Adjusting contingency amounts would need to be
agendized for a later date.


Council Member Price asked how the additional consultants would be used.


Mr. Sartor said they would review past change orders and help Staff in
moving forward.


Council Member Price stated that the core issue for change orders was
because the original documentation lacked sufficient information. She said
Staff understood the project in its entirety and asked if the consultants
would be addressing the issues on change orders.


Mr. Sartor said yes. He stated that a good example was that the project was
at the point where major activities would be taking place in the areas of
mechanical, electrical, and plumbing where change orders may be required.
Staff did not have a complete handle of the specifications and drawings and
have asked the consultants to help.
