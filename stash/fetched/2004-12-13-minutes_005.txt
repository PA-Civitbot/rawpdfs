     “Moonlit Cinema Paradiso” for the Palo Alto Schools and Recreation
     Programs.

Sunny Dykwel expressed her thanks to the community for their support, and
acknowledged the hard-working committee members. The 2004 Black and
White Ball was an unprecedented collaboration of volunteers from the
school, the community, City staff, and local civil leaders. Together they
produced a fabulous event that Palo Alto could call its own, and raised
approximately $178,550.

Alto Recreation Foundation (PARF), he was proud of the tremendous success
of the Black and White Ball.

Council Member Kleinberg said the Black and White Ball was a smashing
event, which was orchestrated by Dan and Sunny Dykwel. She expressed
congratulations to the team and the teamwork.

Vice Mayor Burch said having attended the Black and White Ball at a number
of different venues, he felt it found its home at Lucie Stern and hoped it
would continue at that location.

Council Member Freeman said she enjoyed dancing with wanton abandon.

Mayor Beecham said he appreciated the efforts, as well as the service and
funding provided to the community. He expressed thanks to the entire
committee.

Mayor Beecham announced an agreement on the Mayfield site. He said there
would be a public announcement on Tuesday, December 14, 2004, at 5 p.m.
