Lee I. Lippert, AIA, P&TC Representative, stated during the P&TC meetings
there had been discussion regarding the Middlefield and Ross Roads
crossings. A major reason for the pedestrian and bicycle safety crossing
were the two schools were directly impacted by the Expressway traffic.

Council Member Schmid asked the difference in impact of the trees for the
Middlefield alternatives.

Transportation Project Engineer, Rafael Rius stated during the peak traffic
periods widening the street provided a flexibility for leveling traffic flow for
right turns. In widening the road there would be tree removal.

Council Member Schmid asked why the traffic flow chart showed a small
amount of pedestrian or bicycle traffic for Middlefield and Ross Roads during
peak hours.

Mr. Rius stated the study calculated approximately twenty persons crossing
during peak hours at both non-signaled roads.

Council Member Schmid stated the busiest road appeared to be Greer Road.

Mr. Rius stated yes, Greer and Louis Roads were both signalized and heavily
used for school routes.

Council Member Schmid asked whether the school hours conflicted with the
peak traffic hours.

Mr. Rius stated the pedestrian study was counted during peak traffic hours
from 7:00 AM to 9:00 AM.

Council Member Schmid noted the bicycle volumes were heaviest on Louis
and Greer Roads rather than Ross Road or Oregon Expressway.

Mr. Williams clarified both Greer and Louis Roads were residential areas with
crossing signals opposed to Ross or Middlefield Roads which currently had
none and were heavily congested and avoided by pedestrians and bicyclists.

Council Member Schmid asked for clarification that Ross Road ended
approximately a block after the Expressway.

Mr. Rius stated yes, although the intended purpose of the bicycle route was
to support the local neighborhoods and the school commutes.
