                      FINAL MINUTES

Bob Moss noted how the Council needed to take into account, as a regular
process, developments that were brought forward. A major reason why 27
University Avenue and 395 Page Mill Road were pulled was because former
Mayor Scharff decided that Planned Community Zoning needed to have a
careful evaluation. People needed to take a careful look at the impacts of
development.

Shani Kleinhaus wanted to see more recognition of natural areas in Palo
Alto, especially in connection with the Comprehensive Plan. She wanted to
see more attention given to nature in 2014.

ADJOURNMENT: The meeting was adjourned at 9:26 P.M.
