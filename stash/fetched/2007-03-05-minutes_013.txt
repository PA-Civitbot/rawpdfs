clarification on the temporary discontinuance of use.

Mr. Baum said the Charter had no reference to temporary discontinuance.

Council Member Beecham asked how temporary discontinuance be interpreted
if temporary use was not explicit.

Mr. Baum said in his opinion the lack of reference to temporary use of the
park meant it was not covered in the Charter provision. The PIO provided
another mechanism for public review and the Council would need to pass an
ordinance, which would be subject to a referendum.

Council Member Beecham asked whether the City Attorney believed it was
affordable if parkland was temporarily lost during construction.

Mr. Baum said yes.

Council Member Beecham said the project would be funded with the water
utility fund. It would be paid back through water utility billing process
whether it was temporarily funded by a reserve or a bond. He supported the
motion as well as an advisory vote.

Mayor Kishimoto questioned if the ordinance would be subject to a
referendum.

Mr. Baum said yes.

Mayor Kishimoto asked whether timing would be an issue with an advisory or
mandatory vote or could the Council approve the ordinance and wait for a
referendum.

Mr. Baum said he would recommend the PIO be passed at this eveningâ€™s
meeting to move the program forward.           He was not aware of any legal
criteria on timing to place the item on the ballot. Once an ordinance was
approved, there would be two readings with a 30-day waiting period. The
item could still go to the vote of the people.

Mayor Kishimoto asked whether the 130-foot height of buildings in the
Stanford expansion project would affect the fire suppression calculations.

Mr. Cwiak said the buildings would have pumps and sprinkler systems inside
the buildings. The fire requirement for the buildings would be less than the
existing older buildings in the pressure zone.
