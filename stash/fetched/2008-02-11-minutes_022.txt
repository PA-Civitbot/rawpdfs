come forward to tell the Council whether they want a tax or not.

Council Member Morton requested clarification from the City Attorney
regarding the vote tonight.

Mr. Baum responded it is not the final approval.

Council Member Morton asked the City Attorney if these were more policy
statements than actual adoption of the financing mechanism.

Mr. Baum responded yes.

Council Member Kishimoto asked if the Amendment did not pass does that
mean that staff will not move forward on taxes.

Committee with a number of ways to structure the Business License Tax.
Staff did not have any direction at this point about investigating beyond
what we have done on the 9-1-1 Fee.
