Mr. Baum said a motion to table was not debatable.

MOTION TO TABLE PASSED 4-3, Beecham, Freeman, Kishimoto no.

Council Members Mossar and Cordell returned to the Council discussion since
the Stanford Lands item was completed.

Mr. Williams reiterated the one major issue of change was the increased
height for biotech and R&D in areas along Embarcadero and towards the Sun
Microsystems’ site.

MOTION: Council Member Morton moved, seconded by Burch, to adopt a
parallel provision to what was adopted for the Stanford Lands, to allow the
additional height, with the 150 foot setback for anything adjacent to
residential.

MOTION PASSED 9-0.
