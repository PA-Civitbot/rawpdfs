experiencing would become the standard for future Senior Games.

Ms. Cribbs stated there was a need for four thousand volunteers to run the
event. There were volunteer registration forms on the website.

involved to interact with the senior athletes. He suggested involving the two
High School campuses and Stanford University.

years their organization had been doing the Bay Area Senior Games in
preparation for this event where they had High School involvement and it
worked out very well.

entice the 16,500 qualifiers to join in the event.

on ways to encourage more participation.
