      inspire community leaders, middle school staff at all three public
      middle schools and parents. City Council members and School Board
      trustees have added their voices to the effort by launching a campaign
      to reach out wider in the community. A few key messages presented
      included our community has a history of supporting youth, and every
      person in Palo Alto can be an asset builder. At every chance we ask
      people to take advantage of every moment to build assets in every
      child. A few examples include: Take the time to listen when a young
      person speaks.     Set an example for youth.     Take the initiative in
      engaging young people positively. Smile and make eye contact with
      young people. Even when a child is in trouble try to concentrate on
      what is right with them.
