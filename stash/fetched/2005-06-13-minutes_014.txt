Council Member Kishimoto said she would like to discuss the issue of a seven
person Council.

Vice Mayor Kleinberg said adding a third term to the current two terms could
perpetuate an inbred Council; ever-changing community demographics were
enabled by Council turnover.

MOTION: Council Member Morton moved, seconded by Burch, to agree to
agendize at an upcoming Council meeting the proposal for a Council -
Member third term with a full discussion by Council and the public, and to
direct the City Attorney to prepare the necessary documentation for this
discussion.

Council Member Morton said he would like to have further information from
the City Attorney and City staff.

Mayor Burch said he felt it was important to bring the issue forward.

Council Member Freeman said there could be                some    unintended
consequences that could result from an additional term.

MOTION FAILED 4-4, Burch, Kishimoto, Morton, Ojakian yes, Mossar
absent.

Council Member Ojakian asked for the matter to be reconsidered at the next
meeting so Council Member Mossar would have the opportunity to voice her
thoughts.

Assistant City Manager Emily Harrison advised the Council that the next
Council Meeting agenda included the approval of the budget.

Council Member Ojakian said it would be nice to have Council Member
Mossarâ€™s vote.

Council Member Beecham said the issue should be put on the Consent
Calendar.

Vice Mayor Kleinberg said when the vote was split, the motion failed.

City Attorney Gary Baum said it could be a continuance.

Mayor Burch said he wanted a vote on whether the matter could be
continued to the next meeting.
