Council Member Burt: I do have a solution to that.

Mayor Holman: Okay. If you don't have—Council Member Burt had his light
on, but actually the next in order is Vice Mayor, Marc Berman, Council
Member Burt and Council Member Wolbach. Would you care to get in line,
Council Member Scharff?

Council Member Scharff: Yeah. I just wanted to know if he'd put in the
word "aspirational"? Council Member Burt said he also had some language,

Council Member DuBois:      Can we just resolve this quickly?   Can you say
what yours is real quick?

Mayor Holman: I was looking at Council Member DuBois. Maybe the two of
you have worked out some different language?

Council Member Burt: I have one. I recognize that really establishing a goal
at this time which we might change within four months looks like we're just
not committed to what we call as a goal. Would "preferred alternative,"
that's our present thinking.       It's a preferred alternative.    It's not
aspirational; it's more concrete but less ...

Council Member DuBois: That works for me.

Council Member Burt: That works, okay.

Mayor Holman: Let's give David a moment here to put it on the screen.
That works for both the maker and seconder of the motion? Okay.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to replace in the Motion Part A, “goal” with
“preferred alternative.”

Mayor Holman: Council Member Kniss, did you have any other questions on
the motion?

Council Member Kniss: I don't have any other questions, no.

Vice Mayor Schmid: I support the motion to move ahead with a clear
direction. Two questions in "B," subcategory (a). There's a phrase in there,
