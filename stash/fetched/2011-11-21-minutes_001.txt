SPECIAL ORDERS OF THE DAY

1.   Community Group Presentation - Developmental Assets Initiative,
     Project Safety Net.


     The City Council heard a presentation from one of our community
     collaborative   teams   working   on   Project   Safety   Net   strategy
     implementation - The Developmental Assets Initiative. Developmental
     Assets are the positive values, relationships, and experiences that
     youth need to thrive. Youth with low asset levels are more likely to
     engage in risky behaviors and fail to achieve at school. Youth with high
     asset levels are more likely to choose healthy activities, succeed in
     school, and avoid risky behaviors. Put simply, “More Assets ==> More
     thriving.” The Palo Alto Developmental Assets Initiative team launched
     the Asset of the Month campaign to raise awareness. Banners
     promoting asset building can be seen around the city. The team has
     carried the message to our community organizations and recently
     brought Clay Roberts, a wonderful trainer, to Palo Alto to train and
