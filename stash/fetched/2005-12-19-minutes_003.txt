plan. Safety remained an issue in the Arastradero Road/Charleston Corridor.

Penny Ellson, 513 El Capitan Place, said the use of the Stanford Research
Park Impact Fee and the Budget Amendment Ordinance should be approved
to move the Arastradero Road/Charleston Corridor plan forward.

the Arastradero Road/Charleston Corridor Plan.

Impact Fee, they indicated the fee should fund 100 percent of the
intersection improvements.

     improvement to provide adequate alternative mitigation of impacts
     addressed in the Citywide Land Use and Transportation Study Draft
     Environmental Impact Report and the Environmental Impact Report for
     the 1998-2010 Comprehensive Plan, as allowed for under Section
     16.45.060 (f) of the Palo Alto Municipal Code;
  • The Budget Amendment Ordinance in the amount of $965,000 to
     increase funding in the Capital Improvement Program (CIP) for the

     from $100,000 to $1,065,000 to fund the implementation of the of the
     Charleston/Arastradero Corridor Trial and the Gunn High School
     Driveway/Arastradero Road Intersection and Roadway Modifications,

     Section E of Proposed Budget Amendment Ordinance;
  • Direct staff to send a letter to the Palo Alto Unified School District
     Board of Education transmitting the City Council’s action and

forward.
