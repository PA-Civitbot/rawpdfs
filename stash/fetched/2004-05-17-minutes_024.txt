Mr. Benest said the City had a performance-based situation. An accepted
manner to entice executives to Palo Alto would be to make them “at will”
employees with a severance package.

Council Member Kleinberg asked why there was no minimum employment
term associated with severance.

Ms. Furth said it was a means to induce high-level individuals to come to
Palo Alto, which also provided a commitment from the City.

Council Member Kleinberg asked whether it were good policy to have
freedom of severance benefits for individuals without any term.

Mr. Benest said the incentive was the four-month severance package
available for the first year.

Council Member Kishimoto said the City worked with merit rules and
department heads were critical to the overall productivity.

MOTION: Council Member Mossar moved, seconded by Morton, to approve
the Policy and Services Committee recommendation to the City Council to
adopt a new policy under which all Department Heads Hired after July 1,
2004, will be “at will” employees whose terms of employment are specified
by an employment contract.

MOTION PASSED 6-3, Cordell, Kleinberg, Freeman “no”.
