Council the chance to have a building that serves the entire population. He
asked whether the school bonds that passed recently were June measures.

Council Member Barton replied there was a School bond measure in 1995
and two parcel taxes that passed in June. The one that failed was in
November.

Council Member Morton stated there was some danger of this project going
on too long. Getting this on the ballot and getting people out for a June 2008
measure would be the best way to go. He stated he supported having both
items on the same ballot but as different measures.

Mayor Kishimoto asked whether he supported June 2008 or November 2008.

Council Member Morton replied he wanted to keep his options open, but
would consider putting it on the June ballot.

Council Member Beecham asked whether it was possible to keep the size
options on the table.

Assistant Director Public Works Mike Sartor stated the Request for Proposals
and Scope of Work, which would be developed for the Mitchell Park Library
and Community Center, also includes the Main and Downtown Libraries.

Council Member Beecham asked why there were two different sized facilities.

Mr. Sartor replied there are two scenarios for keeping the technical services
staff in the Downtown Library and then moving staff to the new facility in
Mitchell Park.

Council Member Beecham inquired whether there would be an impact of the
decision.

Mr. Sartor stated not in terms of the design contact, which would return to
the Council for approval in early May.

Council Member Beecham asked when the Council would have to make a
final decision.

City Clerk Donna Rogers replied a decision would be needed in March for a
June 2008 ballot.

Mr. Baum added this would be a tremendous amount of work in order for
staff to be well prepared.
