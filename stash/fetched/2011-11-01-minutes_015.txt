Mayor Espinosa stated that the Council would want the City to develop a
process in partnering with the School District to come up with a
comprehensive and a long-term plan and to be transparent and inclusive.

Council Member Schmid said his understanding was that the Cubberley
contract expired at the end of 2014 and a 12-month notice needed to be
given by either party setting a hard deadline for 2013 for conclusion. He
raised concerns of the CAC working on its own for six months and felt it
would be beneficial to have overlap with the PAC.

AMENDMENT:         Council Member Schmid moved, seconded by Council
Member XXX that the Policy Advisory Commission would start in June with
opportunity for interactions with Community Advisory Commission

AMENDMENT FAILED DUE TO LACK OF A SECOND

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER that the PAC will start in June 2012 and receive a
report from the CAC midway through the CAC meeting period.

Council Member Holman noted that Council Member Klein had requested to
add Acterra to the process and did not see that added.

Council Member Klein stated the language was changed and added the
verbiage “one or more environmental organizations.”

Council Member Holman asked if the Guiding Principles would come to
Council for adoption.

Mr. Keene said yes, with a caveat that there was another party in the
process and amendments and clarifications would be made as the process
unfolds.

Council Member Holman stated the Motion had many parts. She asked that
the Motion be added to the Staff report that comes back to the Council for
quick reference and clarity.

Mr. Keene said that could be done.
