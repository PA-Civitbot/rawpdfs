Council Member Drekmeier asked if 157 new housing units would be needed
per 100,000 square feet.

Ms. Funk confirmed it was 157 worker households per 100,000 square feet.

Council Member Drekmeier asked whether 2,000 new housing units would be
needed.

Ms. Funk stated yes.

City Attorney Gary Baum recommended the Council adopt the Ordinance. He
pointed out there were a number of factors ignored by the Stanford
consultant report: 1) the fee would be only charged on an expansion; and 2)
a clinic is not a hospital but they do create an impact. It is unquestionable
that the hospital and office expansion would increase the need for affordable
housing in Palo Alto.

Council Member Drekmeier asked the distinction between a hospital and a
clinic.

Mr. Baum replied according to law, a clinic and hospital have vastly different
uses.

Council Member Drekmeier asked whether this would affect both of the uses
of the fee as well as other organizations such as the Palo Alto Medical
Foundation.

Mr. Baum replied yes.

Mr. Emslie replied the Code defines clinics separately from hospitals and the
Palo Alto Medical Foundation would not be considered a hospital.

Mr. Baum corrected himself stating it would only affect hospitals.

Council Member Drekmeier asked whether this would also apply to the clinic
aspect as well.

Mr. Emslie stated based on the information given it would apply to the
hospitals.

Council Member Drekmeier asked if Stanford came forward and stated the
1.3 million square feet would be split into half as clinic and half as hospital,
would there have to be a discussion on the impact fees.

Mr. Emslie stated yes.

Mayor Kishimoto     clarified   this   agenda   item   would   be   removing   an
exemption.
