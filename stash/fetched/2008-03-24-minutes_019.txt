Mr. Emslie stated the Summerhill project provided a pedestrian walkway that
ends at the property line which would stay the same. However, the input
from the Council in January stated there was a strong desire to have access
to the park, which Summerhill had provided by connecting at a shorter
distance from Wilkie Way on the far south end of the property.

Council Member Morton asked if the Council wanted the pedestrian access to
go all the way to the future path would the City have to get an easement or
a condemnation for the area from Wilkie Way back to the future path.

Mr. Emslie stated that was correct.

Council Member Morton asked if we could get both paths in hopes that we
might want pedestrian access all the way to the future path as well as the
alternate path connection.

Mr. Emslie stated he had spoken to the developer and would leave both
options open. The Staff had strongly favored the alternate path connection
access.

Council Member Morton asked for clarification that there would not be
pedestrian access.

Mr. Emslie stated that was correct.

Council Member Morton asked why we would not want to go all the way to
the end of the street.

Mr. Baum stated in order to do Eminent Domain we would need to
demonstrate a public purpose. There may be a question for condemning the
entire strip when we could achieve the same thing with a smaller strip. He
would like to seek the advice of outside Counsel on Eminent Domain the
Eminent Domain Council to make sure.

Council Member Morton asked if we could request the Eminent Domain
Council to verify that.

Mr. Baum stated we could request that by friendly negotiation then it would
be a great deal easier.

Council Member Morton stated that in the letter that was presented to
Council it was a suggestion that the shorter area be decided upon within 12
months.
