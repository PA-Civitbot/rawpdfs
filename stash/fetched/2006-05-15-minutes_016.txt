Mayor Kleinberg said no. There were a number of strategies the PAUSD and
Library Division could explore which had not been discussed.

Council Member Morton said the PTA had already taken a position of not
wanting adults on school sites during the day.

Mayor Kleinberg said she met with the PTA and that information was not
correct.

Vice Mayor Kishimoto noted the Council received a letter from the PTA
President asking for more outreach. With regard to the Digital Versatile Discs
(DVDs), she was open to implementing a nominal fee. It could help pay for
the additional full time equivalent (FTE) staff.

Council Member Drekmeier asked where the capital costs would come from.

Council Member Klein said from a bond measure. The bond measure would
pay for construction costs, but other expenses would need to come from
another source such as a parcel tax, the General Fund, revenue stream, etc.

Council Member Drekmeier asked whether the City was being locked into a
bond measure to cover the capital improvements.

Council Member Klein said no with regard to the language, but yes in
practicality. It would be difficult to come up with the monies anywhere else.

Council Member Drekmeier asked about a parcel tax.

Council Member Klein indicated that was also possible.

Council Member Drekmeier had a concern about bonds in that they borrowed
from the future, which at some point had to be paid off.

Council Member Klein said the bond measure carried with it the payment
process.

Council Member Drekmeier said it was an additional tax.

MOTION PASSED 8-0, Cordell absent.

Mayor Kleinberg noted the two closed sessions, Agenda item nos. 7 and 8,
would not be heard that evening and would be moved to a Special Finance
Committee Meeting on Tuesday, May 23, 2006 at 6 p.m.
