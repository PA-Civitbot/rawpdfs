used that to redeploy 6 FTEs to Station 2 to fully staff a 24-hour ambulance.
An ambulance was located at Station 2, but it was fully staffed for only 12
hours per day. Staff reclassified 1 FTE to Fire Inspector with full cost
recovery through the Development Center. This resulted in a net reduction
of 2 FTEs.      Six vacancies had existed for some time, and the FC
recommended elimination of those positions rather than freezing them. The
net restructuring plan resulted in 8 FTE reductions in the Fire Department.

Mr. Perez noted the freezing of 7 FTEs and 14 vacancies in the Police
Department.     Because of the vacancies, the Department would deploy
officers in a different manner. Staff did not recommend these vacancies
become permanent reductions until a study of the redeployment was
complete. Staff proposed freezing five positions in the Library Department,
which would be reinstated once the library upgrades were complete. Staff
proposed City-wide fee increases of 3 percent or $570,000. Staff instituted
a 5 percent technology fee that was going into the Technology Fund. This
new fee would support new City-wide initiatives. Staff reinstated $1.88
million in expenditures and $930,000 in revenues for Animal Services,
leaving a net cost of $949,000. Removing the contract base of $500,000
left a gap of $449,000. The P&S recommended Staff reduce expenditures by
$200,000 and increase revenues by $100,000 to compensate for the loss of
revenue from Mountain View. The FC recommended adding $149,000 as a
gap that needed to be closed. Staff was formulating a plan for a 50 percent
increase in revenues and a 50 percent increase in cost reductions. The 50
percent reduction in costs would be approximately $225,000, which matched
the P&S recommendation. In FY 2014, the gap would increase by $170,000,
the amount of money from Mountain View for the first four months in FY
2013. That gap would need to be addressed. A timeline for instituting any
proposed new fees for the Animal Shelter would include a 14-day notice
process. Staff planned discussions with stakeholders in July 2012.

Mr. Keene reported the Council would need to balance appropriation of
expenditures in the Budget before adopting it on June 18, 2012. Staff
expected to present a fee schedule, rate changes, and an expenditure
reduction plan for Council consideration in early July 2012.

Mr. Perez reported the pension expense had dramatically increased over
time. Eliminating 10.5 positions and freezing 14 positions kept the pension
expense constant for FY 2013. The healthcare benefits increase for current
employees would remain constant from FY 2012 to FY 2013, because of
Public Safety contributions to healthcare. Property taxes remained flat or
increased slightly.   Sales tax revenue returned to the FY 2008 level;
however, expenditures remained above the FY 2008 level. The Utility Users
