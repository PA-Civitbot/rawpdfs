Vice Mayor Yeh asked for an update on the aggressiveness that the City was
pursuing implementation of energy efficiency initiatives.

Ms. Fong stated at the present time presenting an update would be
premature.

MOTION:       Vice Mayor Yeh moved, seconded by Council Member Scharff to
accept the    Finance Committee, Staff, and the Utilities Advisory Commission
to adopt      the Resolution approving the proposed Long-Term Electric
Acquisition   Plan (LEAP) Objectives, Strategies, and Implementation Plan.

Council Member Scharff stated the LEAP Plan balanced a number of
competing and complex issues. He asked how close the City was to meeting
the renewables goal.

Ms. Padilla stated if the Western Geo Project was acquired, the City would be
at 30 percent.

Council Member Scharff stated the Western Geo Project combined with the
anaerobic digestion would accomplish the 33 percent.

Council Member Burt asked whether the 30 percent Staff mentioned was
inclusive of feed-in-tariffâ€™s.

Ms. Padilla stated no, although it left room to add them.

Council Member Burt stated he did not understand the response and asked
for clarification.

Ms. Padilla clarified the anaerobic digester and the feed-in-tariff could
potentially be competing for the 33 percent.

Council Member Burt stated the City had no rule regarding reaching a higher
goal.

Ms. Padilla stated with the two subjects combined the goal could reach 35
percent.

Council Member Burt stated between an anaerobic digester, the feed-in-
tariff, and the increased deficiency the City had accomplished it could very
well exceed 33 percent.

Council Member Schmid stated conversion technology was a green
technology sweeping through California at a momentous rate and had a
higher effective rate in cost, greenhouse gas, and energy production. He
asked why Staff had not considered conversion technology amongst the 38
initiatives.
