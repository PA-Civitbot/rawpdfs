Council Member Morton asked for clarification on lowering the BMR
requirement from five units to three units and how that affected the fifteen
percent category.

Mr. Emslie stated if the lot was less than five acres there was a fifteen
percent requirement. There needed to be a minimum of seven units built
prior to BMR unit dedication.

Council Member Morton inquired on whether Policy 2-C encouraged
developers to come in at full allowable coverage.

Mr. Emslie stated no. The City had the discretion for site, design, and open
space requirements.

Mayor Klein asked whether there were calculations of the subsidies the
buyer had received over the years.

Mr. Emslie showed a flow chart of numbers from purchase to sale over the
past twenty years.

Mayor Klein asked for the cost explanation of re-writing the retroactive
increase in the CPI and the credit formula proposed.

City Attorney Gary Baum stated the credit formula would have a one-time
cost absorbed by the Housing Fund in an amount of twenty-five to fifty
thousand dollars. It would cost approximately twenty thousand dollars per
unit for retroactive increases.

Mayor Klein asked whether an increase to the CPI retroactively would be fair
to the persons who had sold during the interim.

Mr. Baum stated legally there would be no action against the City.

Council Member Barton asked for clarification on the previous intent to give
home ownership opportunities to lower income levels and the current plan to
stabilize the ownership ability at the median income level.

Mr. Emslie stated the driver of the one-third CPI was the economic
conditions at that time.

Council Member Barton asked whether the belief of the one-third CPI policy
was to keep the units in the median income range or was the intent to push
the income level below the median.
