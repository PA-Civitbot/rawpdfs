Council Member Holman: Thank you for that. Thank you for all your
comments and to Karen Kienzle as well. Just a couple of quick comments.
One of the things that Paula Kirkeby also did was she supported young
collectors, buying their first pieces, which is very important in getting
involved in that. The thing I was going to say was I think—it's maybe
unprecedented, certainly unusual and I've never experienced it before.
When Paula Kirkeby came before the Planning Commission—I don't
remember if you were there at that time or not, Pat—she asked for an
extension of her conditional use permit for the Pepper location because it's in
a residential neighborhood. The Commission actually granted her not just
the single Conditional Use Permit (CUP) extension, but doubled her
requested time on the CUP. I've just not heard of that happening before or
since. It just is a great demonstration of how much the neighbors supported
her location on Pepper and how much the community supports her and her
efforts. She will indeed be missed.

Adjournment:    The meeting was adjourned in memory of Paula Kirkeby at
10:38 P.M.

Mayor Burt: On that note, the meeting is adjourned.
