Mr. Pintar asked if Council Member Kleinberg was referring to the time
between 1997 and 2000.

2002.

Mr. Pintar asked if she was referring to the timeframe from the first contact
until the administrative hearing.

repairs.

Mr. Pintar said work was being performed at that time. A permit had been
obtained prior to the hearing.

Council Member Kleinberg asked if there was a permit in 1997.

Mr. Pintar said there was a permit for the Metro Circle property. He was
unsure if there was a permit in 1997, but said there was work being
performed in 1998-1999 on the Metro Circle property.

Council Member Kleinberg said it took four to five years to repair the roof
and remove the materials.

Mr. Pintar confirmed.

Council Member Mossar asked why there had been no attempt to have a
final inspection on the work completed.

Mr. Pintar said there had been a final inspection on the Metro Circle
property. The final inspection on Ross Road was completed a month prior.
No excuse could be offered as to why the final inspections were not made.

would not make an attempt to clear up the problem.

Mr. Pintar said he had made an attempt.

Council Member Cordell asked about Mr. Bradshawâ€™s profession.

Mr. Bradshaw said he was an electronics engineer and was laid-off from a
job with Ford Aerospace.

Council Member Cordell said Mr. Bradshaw owned three properties in Palo
Alto and asked whether they generated rental income.
