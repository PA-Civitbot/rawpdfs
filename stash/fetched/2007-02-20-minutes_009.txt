Ken Auerbach, 825 Matadero Avenue, stated he opposed the subdivision.

D. Christian Kalar, 3716 Laguna Avenue, stated he opposed the subdivision.

Mr. Nguyen asked to grant approval of the subdivision.

Ms. Dijch-Bhodlkamkar stated she opposed the subdivision.

Mayor Kishimoto declared the Public Hearing closed at 8:33 p.m.

Mayor Kishimoto inquired whether the City Attorney would like to summarize
the findings for the Council.

Mr. Baum stated in order to deny the subdivision map, the Council would
have to determine that one of the following issues is present: 1) the map is
not consistent with the plans; 2) the design or improvement is not
consistent with the plan; 3) the site is not suitable for the development; 4)
the design will cause substantial environmental damage; 5) the design will
cause health problems; or 6) the design would conflict with existing
easements.

Council Member Cordell inquired whether stating the subdivision did not fit
with the character of the neighborhood would be within the criteria to deny
the subdivision.

Mr. Baum stated character would not be a requirement within the
Subdivision Map Act.

Mr. Emslie agreed with the statement.

Council Member Cordell inquired whether the argument of the subdivision
not fitting with the character of the neighborhood would be considered
outside the denial criteria.

Mr. Baum responded the Council could not deny a subdivision on those
grounds.

Council Member Cordell inquired whether the 10,000 square foot subdivision
overlay had been pursued, and could that apply to the project.

Mr. Baum responded the Council would be allowed to change the zoning on
any project prior to the issuance of a building permit. However, traditionally
in the City of Palo Alto, any project in process could not be interrupted.

Council Member Cordell asked if there were a zoning change, would the
applicant be grandfathered in.
