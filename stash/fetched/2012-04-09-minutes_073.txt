                      DRAFT MINUTES
Mayor Yeh indicated that they had not discussed the site plans.
He asked for a Motion.

MOTION: Council Member Price moved, seconded by Council
Member Shepherd to defer the discussion of the Conceptual Site
Plans to April 16, 2012 Council meeting or as soon as possible.

Mr. Keene said that the site plans were only meant to be
illustrative and not definitive. He said that the CAC could decide
to start over. The plans were just a starting point and were not
meant to draw any conclusions. He did not think the Council was
bound to comment because the plans were preliminary.

Mayor Yeh said if it was on the Council agenda for the next week
it did not mean that the Council had to comment on it.

MOTION PASSED: 8-0 Scharff absent
