MOTION: Council Member Holman moved, seconded by Council Member
Schmid to direct Staff to agendize an Action Item regarding the City Hall
remodel occurring on the first, second, and mezzanine levels. The report
should include respective costs, better clarity of the project, outcomes,
project components, if all contracts have been awarded, with this being
brought back to Council as soon as possible.

James Keene, City Manager, inquired whether the item could be an
information report.

Council Member Holman wanted an Action Item.

Council Member Berman believed Council Member Holman did not want to
reevaluate the contract, but rather to have a robust discussion of the
renovations.

Mr. Keene understood Council Member Holman's concerns and would return
with information.

Council Member Price attended a planning meeting in Beit Shean, Israel,

ADJOURNMENT: The meeting was adjourned at 10:52 P.M.
