Council Member Morton stated in 2004 the Bonomis had an Arborist who
stated the trees were in excellent health and neither of the trees had
structural problems that could not be dealt with. He did not recommend
removing the trees. He asked whether the dispute was about whether the
trees were healthy.

Managing Arborist Dave Dockter reported the three Arborists stated the
branch growth of the tree could be managed.

Council Member Morton asked whether the Redwood trees produced a level
of toxins.

Mr. Dockter stated he was not an expert of toxins from the debris.

Council Member Morton asked whether it was a general assumption the trees
produced toxic sap.

Mr. Dockter replied no.

Council Member Morton stated that was the second contention in which they
were asked to override the Director’s findings.

MOTION: Council Member Barton moved, seconded by Mossar, to accept
the recommendation of staff and the Planning and Transportation
Commission to uphold the Director of Planning and Community
Environment’s decision to deny the Protected Tree Removal Permit to
remove two ordinance-sized Coast Redwoods at 526 Lowell Avenue based
upon the findings and conditions in the Record of Land Use Action
(Attachment A).

Council Member Barton stated the Arborist in 2004 stated the trees were
fine. The current Arborist stated that work contributed to 75 percent root
damage. It seems that much of the damage was created by the appellants
and that could not be a contributing factor to override these findings.

Council Member Mossar stated this was the same situation as the Planning
and Transportation Commission. She stated she could not make the findings.

Vice Mayor Klein acknowledged a very high number of requests for permits
have been granted and with that many approvals, he stated the Ordinance
might be faulty. He supported overruling the Planning Commission and the
Director of Planning.
