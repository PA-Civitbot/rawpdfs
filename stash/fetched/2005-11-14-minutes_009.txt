Mayor Burch declared the Public Hearing closed at 8:12 p.m.

Council Member Morton expressed concern about the traffic circle at
Emerson Street and Everett Avenue, and asked whether its removal
would have a major impact.

Director of Planning and Community Environment Steve Emslie said
staff had a plan in place that worked, and any major changes to add or
delete devices was strongly opposed.

Council Member Morton asked whether staff had any objection to
having the traffic circles landscaped by the neighbors.

Mr. Emslie said no.

Council Member Morton asked whether the addition of an advisory
committee that allowed staff to explore the possibility of landscaping
by the neighbors was acceptable.

Assistant City Manager Emily Harrison said staff would prefer to come
back to Council with a plan after having talked to the neighbors.

Council Member Morton said he understood there was still a concern
about Johnson Park. He asked whether staff would come back and
recommend a speed table on either side of the park if they believed it
was better than a stop sign.

Mr. Emslie said yes.
