STUDY SESSION

1.    Status Update on Elements of the Wildland Fire Management Plan.

Consultants, Carol Rice (WRM) and Cheryl Miller (Amphion), presented a
summary and status report on their project to update the Foothills Fuel
Management Plan (FFMP). The scope of the project entails fire hazard
identification and suggested mitigation measures in the City areas west of
Foothill Expressway/Junipero Serra Boulevard (known as the Wildland Urban
Interface (WUI). The specific focus was on fuel-load reduction and related
treatments in; 1) Foothills Park, 2) Pearson-Arastradero Preserve, and 3)
key infrastructure, such as water tanks and evacuation routes.

In accordance with best practices, the consultants explained that they will
seek to minimize environmental impact from fire hazard reduction
treatments by; 1) only treating about ten percent of park lands, 2) using
optimized techniques (grazing or hand crews), and 3) timing the treatments
so as to minimize impact on ecosystems. Palo Alto Fire Station 8 staffing was
under review and will be presented at the final presentation to Council later
this year.
