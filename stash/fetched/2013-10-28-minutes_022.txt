Mayor Scharff wished to provide a policy directive to Staff to end the
discussion of electronic billboards. Community comments did not support
a digital message board, and digital message boards were not a part of
the community's values.

MOTION: Mayor Scharff moved, seconded by Council Member Kniss that
the City not pursue a digital reader board.

Council Member Schmid indicated the Bayshore Freeway was a defining
characteristic of the City, because it provided a view of the Bay. The
location next to a park was inappropriate. The Bicycle and Pedestrian
Master Plan included a Bayshore-to-Foothills pathway, which would be
adjacent to the proposed location of the message board.

Vice Mayor Shepherd was offended by the prospect of a digital message
board but wanted to receive colleagues' opinion on it.

MOTION PASSED: 7-0 Holman, Price absent

Mr. Keene inquired whether Staff should            permanently    disregard
consideration of a digital message board.

Mayor Scharff stated that was his understanding.

6.   Technology and the Connected City Committee Recommendation to
     Develop Master Plan to Build Out the Cityâ€™s Fiber Optic System to
     Provide Fiber-to-the-Premise and Develop Complementary Wireless
     Network Plan.

Council Member Kniss noted a great deal of interest in a Fiber-to-the-
Premise (FTTP) network, and the Council made it a Priority. She attended a
conference in Kansas City in late May with Vice Mayor and learned a great
deal.   The Staff Report was a result of a recommendation from the
Technology and Connected City Committee (Committee).                 At the
Committee's first meeting in May 2013, the Committee recommended that
Staff develop a work plan to evaluate the feasibility of building a Citywide
high-speed broadband FTTP network. On June 24, 2013, the Committee
approved a recommendation to work on an approach to set in motion
planning work for the FTTP network and the identification of a citizens'
advisory council. On September 17, 2013, Staff recommended to the
Committee the development of a Master Plan to include the addition of a
Wireless Network Plan.     Staff would outline next steps, timelines and
resource impacts. She was excited about the prospect of a faster home
internet connection.
