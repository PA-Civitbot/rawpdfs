                                MINUTES
hours per month in preparation for LAC meetings. Minutes were not taken in
great detail.

Mayor Scharff inquired      whether   the   benefits   of   monthly    meetings
outweighed the costs.

Ms. LeConge felt bimonthly meetings provided more continuity than
quarterly meetings.

Council Member Holman inquired          whether    quarterly   meetings       were
contained in the Municipal Code.

Ms. LeConge answered yes.

Council Member Holman agreed with Council Member Klein's comments
regarding outside organizations holding seats on City Boards and
Commissions. She suggested language regarding extension of current terms
by three months belonged to the first part of the Motion.

Vice Mayor Shepherd agreed.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to change the Municipal Code to reflect bimonthly
meetings instead of quarterly.

Ms. LeConge recommended quarterly meetings with the option of additional
meetings if needed.

Council Member Holman preferred to state bimonthly meetings in order to
set realistic expectations for participation.

Mayor Scharff inquired if the language should include the ability to have
additional special meetings.

Council Member Holman wanted to set realistic expectations for applicants to
the LAC.

Council Member Burt shared the concerns expressed by Council Member
Klein. Rather than having designated seats on the LAC, Friends of the Palo
Alto Library and Palo Alto Library Foundation could be offered liaison roles to
the LAC. He inquired whether Staff attended Friends of the Palo Alto Library
and Palo Alto Library Foundation Board meetings.

Ms. LeConge reported she attended both groups' Board meetings.
