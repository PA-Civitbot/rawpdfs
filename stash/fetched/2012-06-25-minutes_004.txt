ORAL COMMUNICATIONS

Wynn Grcich noted Mr. Moss had written an article regarding toxic hazards in
Palo Alto. A Superfund site in Palo Alto contained a chemical which caused
Parkinson's Disease. Agenda 21 of the United Nations encouraged global
fluoridation of drinking water, even though fluoridation increased cancer
death rates. When cities followed the protocols of Agenda 21, they received
funds for redevelopment.

Omar Chatty stated another death on Caltrain tracks occurred the prior
week. That was the 10th death in 2012, the 26th death since the beginning
of 2011, and the 186th death since 1995. Two Palo Alto residents had died
in 2012 as a result of Caltrain. He hoped someone would ask for a study to
close the gap in the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART). BART had 57 percent
fare box recovery and moved 370,000 people per day. BART would be more
useful for people in the Bay area than high-speed trains. If the High Speed
Rail project was eliminated, then those funds could be used to close the gap
in BART. It would take ten years to implement BART, and there would be
another 160 deaths during that time. BART was responsible for only two
deaths in 2012.

Michael Francois reported on fluoridation as a poison. Palo Alto had areas of
groundwater    contamination     caused    by   Stanford    Research    Park,
Communications & Power Industries Inc. (CPI), and Hewlett Packard (HP).
