Study Session

1. Emergency Medical Services.
Dr. Harold Cohen of SPC/TriData presented the Emergency Medical Services
Study to the Council. This report was commissioned at the request of
Council after TriData did a Fire Services Utilization Study in 2010 and the
City Council sought to understand more about the Palo Alto Fire
Department’s Emergency Medical Services delivery model. Dr. Cohen
reviewed the Palo Alto Fire Department’s EMS efforts and made 21
recommendations in the report. He also provided staff with a five year
strategy to improve service delivery. These recommendations included
staffing, deployment, relationships with County EMS and support functions.
Staff will review these recommendations and consider them for
implementation.
