      From The Utilities Advisory Committee”

MOTION: Council Member Morton moved, seconded by Ojakian, to adopt the
resolution.

MOTION PASSED 9-0.

Vice Mayor Beecham said he had the opportunity to work with Rick Ferguson
during the prior four years, and Rick had the special ability to understand the
complex issues and find a way to explain them in simple, clear, concise terms.
His skills would be missed on the Utilities Advisory Committee (UAC).

Richard Ferguson said he was glad to put in almost five years on the UAC. He
felt honored to have been chosen to fill Fred Eyerly’s seat on the UAC. The City
had a wonderful utility operation and a fine staff. The utilities were in fine shape
for the future.

Council Member Kishimoto said she worked with Rick for a number of years, and
the resolution was well written in documenting Rick’s unique contributions to the
Utilities strategic planning, fiber to the home, and pushing the City in looking at
long-term regional water issues.

Council Member Morton thanked Rick for setting a high set of standards.

ORAL COMMUNICATIONS
