Form Fitness Health Center at Lot S/L Site Non-Parking Area, 445 Bryant
Street

Council Member Ojakian requested a reissue of the Request for Proposal
(RFP) after receipt of a letter from Byron Mellberg, representing Heptagon
Individual Fitness, who placed a higher bid.

Byron Mellberg, 1717 Embarcadero Road, Ritchey Fisher Whitman and Klein,
representing Jason White and Heptagon Individual Fitness, urged the Council
to reopen the leasing process and consider Heptagonâ€™s offer and any other
offers submitted.

Jason White, 131 Lytton Avenue, said he was informed the rent at 445
Bryant Street would be between $3 and $3.50 per square foot and,
therefore, he did not submit a bid proposal.

Herb Borock, P.O. Box 632, suggested the staff and Council follow the policy.

Norman Carroll, Emerson Street and University Avenue, said the City should
not subsidize a volatile business.

Sassan Golafsham, 203 Forest Avenue, said he was ready to fulfill the
obligation as a tenant of 445 Bryant Street. He asked that Form Fitness be
granted the space.

Jeff Manashe, 948 Cowper Street, said there had been a competitive process
and six parties had participated.

Frank Small, 285 Hamilton Avenue, said the late proposal from Heptagon
raised legal issues.

Shahram Seyedin-Noor, 3000 El Camino Real, said it did not appear there
was a decisive reason to reopen the process.

Jeff Ramona said he was surprised at the last minute request from Heptagon
