                       WORKING MINUTES
Ms. Stump reported the Agenda Item would return with a first reading of the
Ordinance on the Consent Agenda, followed by a second reading on the
Consent Agenda.

Council Member Schmid agreed with banning plastic bags and placing a
$0.10 charge on paper bags. A $0.25 charge would create an incentive for
residents to purchase plastic bags for household use, which was
counterproductive. Palo Alto residents would be more likely to convert with
smaller incentives.

AMENDMENT: Council Member Holman moved to eliminate food service
establishments from the Ordinance.

AMENDMENT FAILED DUE TO LACK OF SECOND

Council Member Holman suggested supermarkets be included under retail
service establishment.

Mr. Bobel indicated Staff would carefully review the Ordinance for Council
Member Holman's prior suggestions.

Council Member Holman suggested Farmers Market should be added in the
appropriate location.

Ms. Weiss indicated Farmers Market was included at the bottom of page 6.

Council Member Holman inquired whether Farmers Market should be
included in the definitions of retail service or food service establishments.

Mr. Bobel did not want to include Farmers Market, unless the Council
directed otherwise.

Council Member Price felt the Ordinance was consistent with                     the
community's values and beliefs. She preferred the discussion of a               fee
increase return to the Council in less than 18-24 months. Because of            the
community's disposable income, she did not believe there would                   be
resistance to a $0.25 fee.
