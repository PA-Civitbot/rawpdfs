Council Member Price inquired whether findings from transportation surveys
had been useful in providing profiles of parking and commuting options.

Mr. Fehrenbach indicated the surveys provided a glimpse into parking
options.

Council Member Price asked if survey results were tracked to a specific
location.

Mr. Fehrenbach did not believe so.

Council Member Price recalled that much of the U&O Fee structure was
based on cost recovery and fees in other communities. She asked if that
remained an operating practice.

Peter Pirnejad, Development Services Director, reported Staff would perform
a fee study and would determine if fees were cost neutral.

Council Member Price wondered whether a flat fee was common within the
U&O arena.

Mr. Pirnejad indicated a business license tax was based on gross receipts, a
sliding scale dependent upon the size and success of a business. A business
registry fee should be based on some equivalent non-tax, total receipts
based variable.

Council Member Price understood the current structure was a flat fee of
$413 regardless of the size of the operation. She asked if Staff believed
utilization of a flat fee was common in other communities.

Mr. Pirnejad did not believe a flat fee was common for a business registry. A
business license tax was typically a flat fee for most businesses. After a
certain size or amount of gross receipts, then the business license tax
utilized a sliding scale.

Council Member Schmid felt voluntary compliance was essential to obtaining
data. He favored separating the business registry from the U&O Certificate
process, having only a few questions, obtaining data annually, and utilizing a
flat fee. Comparing City data with an external data source would be
beneficial.
