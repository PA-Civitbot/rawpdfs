David Flint, 1797 Channing Avenue, expressed support for the City's
Emergency Services personnel. He said it seemed unthinkable to cut police

bumps increased the response time of emergency service vehicles and took
its toll on the fire engines.

Mayor Mossar declared the Public Hearing closed at 8:57 p.m.
