Council Member Kleinberg said the flow of traffic in a suburban neighborhood
might be more perceptible during peak hours.

Mr. Kott agreed.

Council Member Kleinberg asked if there was an index more compatible and
useful for quiet suburban neighborhoods.

Mr. Kott said Palo Alto was engaged in the only update in the country of the
TIRE index.

Council Member Kleinberg asked if there was early information available.

Mr. Kott said surveys had been completed but there were no answers
available to date.

Council Member Cordell asked staff whether the TIRE index assessment
would become irrelevant if the Council supported the recommendation to
limit the driveway to emergency access.

Mr. Emslie confirmed.

Council Member Freeman stated the accesses were driveways on El Camino
Real, on Charleston Road and on Wilkie Way. She asked whether legally,
EIRs would go before a policy making body that did not include the
application.

Mr. Beers said staff was asking the Council to consider the revised project.

Council Member Mossar said the Council was certifying an EIR, not approving
a project.

Mayor Beecham declared the Public Hearing open at 8:00 p.m.

Mark Solit, Owner and Representative of Hyatt Ricky’s, said the final EIR
document was five years in the making. The revised project mitigated
almost all of the impacts in the Draft EIR. California Environmental Quality
Act (CEQA) would provide for certification of the document.

Rob Steinberg, Steinberg Group Architects, said the current plan had an
urban edge along El Camino Real and Charleston Avenue, it maintained a
safe entry onto the site, provided a good transition from urban to suburban,
retained the grove of trees, removed automobiles from the streets, and
would be a good neighbor to the Elk’s Club property when it was developed.
