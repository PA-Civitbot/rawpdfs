Mr. Alhassani answered yes. Community Technology Alliance statistics could
provide details by age, sex, and location. He could provide a link to that
information.

Council Member Scharff suggested the Veterans Administration could provide
assistance as well.

Council Member Filseth agreed with targeting homeless veterans for
services. In-place senior housing was an interesting concept. He inquired
about the number of CDBG grants awarded each year.

Ms. Oâ€™Nan advised that grants were spread across three categories.

Council Member Filseth asked which category received the most funding.

Ms. Van Der Zwaag explained that the public service category funded five
agencies for domestic violence and homeless services.

Mr. Alhassani added Catholic Charities.

Ms. Chen included Downtown Streets Team.

Ms. Van Der Zwaag clarified that Downtown Streets Team fell under the
economic development category. Different parts of the InnVision Shelter
Network received funding from both CDBG and HSRAP. The HRC attempted
to target each funding source to different agencies to provide a broad
impact.

Ms. O'Nan indicated CDBG grants funded the Microenterprise Assistance
Program (MAP) which allowed low-income people to start their own
businesses.

Vice Mayor Schmid stated the HRC provided good information to the
community and the Council, built valuable relationships, leveraged
resources, and identified priorities. He was surprised by the number of
homeless veterans in Santa Clara County and Palo Alto.

Stephanie Munoz suggested the Cities of Palo Alto, Mountain View, and
Sunnyvale demand the Federal Government fulfill its obligations to veterans.
The Federal Government had land available to house homeless veterans.
The Birge Clark gymnasium could house homeless people.
