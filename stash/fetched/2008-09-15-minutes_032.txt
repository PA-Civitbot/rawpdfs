Mr. Williams agreed any changes to the design needed to be heard by the
ARB.

Council Member Espinosa stated whether this project returned as a DEE or
Variance, he hoped the basement would be used.

Mayor Klein stated they were ready for a Motion which would be to limit the
space to fifty-feet and then suggest to the ARB and the P&TC that Council
was favorably inclined towards the sidewalk Variance and the treatment of
the FAR exemption and seismic bonus. He stated whether they would
ultimately be treated as DEEâ€™s or a Variance remained a future discussion.
He stressed there should be a strong recommendation or condition that the
basement be used only for mechanical equipment and or retail storage.

Council Member Kishimoto reiterated that she supported the seismic bonus
calculation but had confusion on the basement exemption.

Council Member Burt expressed concern over how explicit the
recommendations were to the Boards and Commissions, and asked why it
would be sent back to the ARB if Council was going to tell them the exact
outcome.

Mayor Klein stated there were many reasons, and that there was no choice
but to send it back. He stated he tried to use open, deliberate language.

Council Member Morton asked the City Attorney if they could deny the
appeal and restrict the height to fifty-feet, but also be explicit that they put
in approval without limitations.

Mr. Baum stated the appeal would have to be upheld and then the project
could be approved with changes.

Council Member Morton asked if that was in effect what they were doing,
and if they were not just sending it back to go through the whole process.

Mr. Baum added they were planning to come back to Council with a Record
of Land Use Action denying this project, so that there would be a complete
record.

Council Member Morton asked if they could uphold the appeal with
restrictions on height and let it go forward.
