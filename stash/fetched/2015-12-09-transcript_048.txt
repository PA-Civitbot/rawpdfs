earlier that we're going to have to accept that there's going to be some

Mayor Holman: Council Member Scharff?

Council Member Scharff: That's fine.

Mayor Holman: Council Member DuBois?

Council Member DuBois: Yep.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to add to the Motion, “with Staff to add language
to the Vision Statement based upon Council Member comments on April 27,
2015, add bullet point 4, ‘add language to maintain sustainable water supply
for the future.’”

Mayor Holman: I want to put one more pitch in for ecosystems, but you all
have spoken.

Council Member Wolbach: Actually I do think we should also Bullet Point 5
as well. It might get repeated in Safety, but I think it's important here as
well.

Mayor Holman: It's already in the Motion.

Council Member Wolbach: No, it was removed.        It was there a couple of
minutes ago, and it got removed.

Council Member DuBois: I asked (inaudible) goal not a vision.

Mayor Holman: I thought it was added to the vision. We're adding ...

Council Member Wolbach:      I think it should be highlighted as a Vision
Statement addition.

Mayor Holman: Council Member Scharff, was that your intention to add
Bullet No. 5 to the Vision Statement?

Council Member Scharff: It wasn't. It was actually to have it as a goal as
Council Member DuBois said. I'm not—do we want to put a line in on the
Vision Statement? I could probably live with that.

Mayor Holman: Council Member DuBois, are you good with that?
