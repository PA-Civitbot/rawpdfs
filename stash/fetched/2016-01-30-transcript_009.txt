since 2012. The average response time increased 20 percent by 57 seconds
despite the decrease in staffing. Urgent calls increased 62 percent, and
again the response time increased 1 minute and 45 seconds.                 Non-
emergency calls decreased, so more of the work is shifting into emergency
and urgent calls. The response time increased by 2 minutes and 35
seconds; however, they're still within their target response time for all of
these. Also, Palo Alto's violent crime rate is 0.9 per 1,000 residents which is
lower than the eight nearby cities that we use to compare with. In the
Police Department, what you're seeing is an increase in workload despite a
decrease in staffing but maintaining their rating of excellent or good.
Moving on to Slide 23. As with the Police Department, similar thing with
Fire. The residents rated the quality of fire services at 97 percent this year.
It was 93 percent in 2010. Again, their authorized staffing is down from 126
1/2 to 108. That's a 15 percent decrease. The number of their medical and
rescue calls increased 19 percent; however, despite that they decreased
their response time by 17 seconds. All other calls for service, false alarms,
hazardous conditions, etc., increased 10 percent from about 2,900 to about
3,100. I can' break out the response times for each of those; we don't have
it broken out that way in ourâ€”we only have Fire, and I couldn't determine
exactly which the others were so I don't have that to compare. Again, the
same message: decreased staffing, increased workload and some improved
response times. Office of Emergency Preparedness, the citizens rated their
services exceptionally better. Those increased from 59 percent to 74
percent. We started tracking staffing in Fiscal Year '12, and it was 4 FTEs at
that point. It's now 3.5 authorized Staff. The number of presentations,
training sessions and exercises that they've done has increased 408 percent
since 2012. They only did 38 back then, and this year they did 193. The
last area of safety is animal control. The citizens rated the quality of Animal
Services higher this year at 80 percent compared to 76 percent in 2010.
The number of animals handled has declined 32 percent from 3,100 to about
2,100 which is primarily due to the loss of the Mountain View contract for
animal control services. Throughout these slides, you've seen a pretty
similar message: declines in staffing but more workload, often faster
processing time. Fewer volunteer hours meant that there was a greater
burden on Staff in addition to the decline in regular staffing levels and the
increase in workload. Slide 24, there were 11 custom questions. We sought
to increase information about how residents communicate with the City. We
asked about how they would report a maintenance issue. The primary
choice, the first choice of most people is to call [video malfunction] they've
engaged in some communication with the City in the past 12 months either
to communicate an issue or to provide feedback. Again the preferred
method is a phone call, 27 percent. Email was 24 percent. 52 percent of
the respondents said they did not contact the City at all. We've made some
efforts to increase the City's use of social media as an option to contact the
                                                                          Page 9 of 86
