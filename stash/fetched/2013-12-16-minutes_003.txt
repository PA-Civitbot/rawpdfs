ORAL COMMUNICATIONS

Stephen Rosenblum stated Caltrain grade separations would affect the look
and feel of Palo Alto in the future. Commuters needed rapid and frequent
service between San Jose and San Francisco. No urban rail mass transit
system utilized grade-level crossings. With grade separations, Caltrain's
schedule would be limited only by customer need and budget, and not gate
downtime.

Bill Rosenberg objected to the installation of bollards in University Avenue.
The plan was to replace concrete barriers along the sidewalk with bollards in
the street. He preferred bike racks be installed.

Wynn Grcich reported fluoridation caused Alzheimer's, lowered children's IQ,
and doubled death rates from breast cancer. Fluoridation of water should be
stopped.

Laybrother Steven Gerard asked the Council to consider citizen overlay
zones. Life peace zones included fatherhood, motherhood, and childhood;
loving life to the final breath; loving animals; and no firearm sales.

Cybele LoVuolo-Bhushan suggested the Council repeal the Vehicle Habitation
Ordinance.

Cheryl Lilienstein believed traffic reports were designed to achieve maximum
development. According to the process, traffic would not become worse
unless it happened to be good. Palo Altans for Sensible Zoning wanted the
City to base development decisions on a continuous, real-time, ongoing
traffic monitoring system. Palo Altans for Sensible Zoning requested a
moratorium on all projects over 10,000 square feet until the monitoring
system was implemented.

Trina Lovercheck thanked Council Members for attending the wonderful
Posada at Buena Vista Mobile Home Park.
