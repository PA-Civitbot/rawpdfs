Mr. Williams stated Staff had not spoken with the PAUSD since 2009;
however, the applicant had spoken with them. He emphasized that
this was one of the very few opportunities to provide affordable
housing to extremely-low and very-low income households.

Council Member Scharff inquired whether this was the right affordable
housing project for the City because it had serious issues with
financing. He indicated that the City was making a huge subsidy.

Mr. Larkin stated the City had the funding it was committing to. There
may be an additional $3 million needed at a later date.

Council Member Scharff inquired whether the Council was asked to
make a commitment for the additional $3 million.

Mr. Williams stated that was correct.

Council Member Holman stated the Substation property was City-
owned and would simply be transferred to the applicant.

Mr. Larkin stated that was correct.

Council Member Scharff stated the Substation property belonged to
the General Fund. Consequently, the Council would be giving $3.5
million to the applicant from the General Fund.

Mr. Larkin stated $3.5 million is the purchase price for the former Ole’s
Auto Repair Shop.

Council Member Scharff inquired what the purchase price of the
Substation property was.

Mr. Larkin stated he was unsure.

Council Member Scharff inquired on the size of the Substation
property.

Mr. Williams stated it was roughly the size of the former Ole’s Auto
Repair Shop.

Council Member Scharff stated the properties were roughly the same
size and price of $3.5 million. He stated the City’s subsidy would then
be $9.3 million.
