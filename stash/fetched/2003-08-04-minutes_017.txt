them for basketball courts.   It required a change to the Terman Specific
Plan.

Mayor Mossar asked Senior Assistant City Attorney Wynne Furth if there
were a way to build the courts and not change the Terman Specific Plan.

Ms. Furth said the Terman Specific Plan required the City to maintain a
certain number of tennis courts on the site.

Senior Assistant City Attorney Nellie Ancel said the Terman Specific Plan
mentioned two basketball courts. It was not believed the document was one
of limitation but one that improvement could be made with four courts and
would not raise an issue of consistency with the Terman Specific Plan.

Council Member Morton clarified that adding four more courts to the two
already there would be considered an improvement not subject to a voter
requirement.

Ms. Ancel said it would be consistent with the park use. She said she did not
think the Terman Specific Plan would be a limitation on the ability to do
improvements that were consistent with the park use.

Council Member Morton said the permanent removal of the tennis courts
would be a change. A temporary dual use did not preclude their usage; it
allowed dual use.

Ms. Ancel said that was what was believed.

Council Member Freeman        asked for clarification on the difference of
basketball being played on the parking lot at Nixon and the circumstances at
hand.

Ms. Harrison referred Council Member Freemanâ€™s question to Paul Dias.

Director of Parks and Recreation Paul Dias said the PAUSD and the City felt
the slope of the parking lot, the unevenness, and the rockiness of the paving
at Terman could cause injuries.

Council Member Freeman asked the difference between Terman and Nixon.

Mr. Dias said he was unfamiliar with the Nixon use of basketball.

Mayor Mossar said after the speakers from the PAUSD spoke, the question
could be asked.
