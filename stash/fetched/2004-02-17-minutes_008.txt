improvement.

approval prior to issuing permits, with a goal of achieving higher rates of
TDM, and to direct staff to work with the Palo Alto Medical Foundation.

staff approval.

MOTION DIED FOR LACK OF A SECOND

Council Member Kleinberg said the problems created by the development
were outweighed by the benefits.

Council Member Freeman asked whether staff would answer questions about
the process when a design was changed from the original Environmental
Impact Report (EIR).

Ms. Grote said an addendum to the EIR would be made for any changes.

Ms. Furth said the design would not need additional documentation if there
were no environmental effects created.

Council Member Freeman asked whether the new management of the Town
and Country Shopping Village would have input into the project.

overlap between the owner/manager and the new property manager.
