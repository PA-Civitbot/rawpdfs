Council Member Morton asked about the two hurdles: 1) the existing debt of
$10 million; and 2) the buyout of the contract for the current golf pro.

Director of Administrative Services Carl Yeats said the outstanding debt was
approximately $5 million. Depending upon the timing, staff would need to
meet with the current tenants to negotiate an exit of their leases. The
amount of $10 million was a high estimate.

Council Member Morton said $10 million plus the payoff of the debt could
equate to approximately $50 million.

Mr. Yeats said the covenant on the debt stated as long as there was still
revenue coming from the golf course the City would be able to meet the
debt service requirements.

Council Member Morton asked if that was not the case would the City have
to make up the difference.

Mr. Yeats said yes.

Council Member Morton asked whether staff anticipated an alternate plan to
cover the costs of developing the sports fields.

City Manager Frank Benest said potentially there were big money donors
who had provided funding for major facilities in the community.

Council Member Morton asked whether the City envisioned a group similar to
the library foundation.

Mr. Benest said yes.

Council Member Mossar said she read recently how the cities of San Jose
and San Francisco were having significant financial problems with their golf
courses. She asked whether staff had any knowledge of their situations and
the relevancy to Palo Alto.

Mr. Emslie said one of staff’s first steps would be to conduct a financial
analysis of Palo Alto’s market and fee structure.

Director of Community Services Richard James said Palo Alto’s golf course
was a viable financial institution that produced revenues each year. In
contrast, the Los Lagos Golf Course in San Jose was struggling to pay its
debt while continuing to get an average of 80,000 to 90,000 rounds per
year.
