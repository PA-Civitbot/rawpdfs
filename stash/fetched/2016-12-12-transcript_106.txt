                        TRANSCRIPT
Council Member Wolbach: I was just going to ask if we need to do some
grammatical cleanup on the amendment added by the maker of the Motion.
It would say "living in, working in or visiting Palo Alto."

Mayor Burt: That's fine. Council Member Schmid.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to replace in the Motion Part A, “and” with “or.”

Council Member Schmid: A clarification that the second was Council Member
Wolbach?

MOTION AS AMENDED RESTATED: Council Member Holman moved,
seconded by Council Member Wolbach to:

A.    Adopt a Resolution affirming Palo Alto’s commitment to a diverse,
      supportive, inclusive and protective community including the addition
      to Section 1, Paragraph Four, “living, working, or visiting” after
      “privileges of everyone;” and

B.    Refer the subject matter of this Memorandum to the Human Relations
      Commission, for recommendation of implementation measures and
      additional elements that should be considered by the Council in the
