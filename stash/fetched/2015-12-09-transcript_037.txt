passes unanimously with Council Members Berman, Burt and Kniss absent.
Council Member Scharff.

MOTION PASSED: 6-0 Berman, Burt, Kniss absent

Council Member Scharff: I guess I'd like to just on the Natural Environment
suggest that we adopt the existing Palo Alto Comprehensive Plan Vision
Statement. Get that out of the way.

Council Member DuBois: I'll second.

MOTION: Council Member Scharff moved, seconded by Council Member
DuBois to adopt the existing Comprehensive Plan Vision Statement for the
Natural Environment Element.

Mayor Holman: Council Member Scharff, would you care to speak to your
Motion?

Council Member Scharff: Yeah. I think we've spoken a little bit about this at
Council before. I think the existing statement is simply better. I prefer it. I
think it's sort of a judgment call, that I think it's better.

Mayor Holman: Council Member DuBois, speak to your second.

Council Member DuBois: I'd like to offer a friendly amendment that we take
the existing goals but we add the new goal on climate change to the end of
the list.

Council Member Scharff: Say that again.

Council Member DuBois: The PTC had a climate change and adaptation goal
in "2."

Mayor Holman: Could you refer to a Page number or such?

Council Member DuBois:     I'm looking at Page 4 of Attachment A, just the
overall structure.

Council Member Scharff: (inaudible)

Council Member DuBois: If we pull out the Safety goals and we added
climate change and adaptation as the last goal to this element.

Council Member Scharff: I'm good with that.
