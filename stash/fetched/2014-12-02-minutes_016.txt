Mayor Shepherd believed it would take time for neighborhoods to organize
and submit applications.

AMENDMENT: Council Member Klein moved, seconded by Council Member
Price to amend the Ordinance to restore "misdemeanor" at the end of
Section 10.50.100.

Council Member Klein advised that the language was common in City
Ordinances; however, the provision was rarely used. The City Attorney
usually charged lower than a misdemeanor, as was within her discretion.
Discretion should remain with the City Attorney.

Council Member Price concurred with Council Member Klein's comments.
She inquired whether a monetary penalty could be implemented in the
future.

Ms. Silver answered yes. Monetary penalties could be included in the
Penalty Resolution the next time it was updated.

AMENDMENT FAILED: 2-7 Klein, Price yes

Council Member Holman advised that the amendment to Section
10.50.060(b)(6) should be made to the new Section 10.50.060(b)(7) as
Staff inserted a new Subsection (b)(6). She suggested language of "permits
are allowed to be issued and transferred."

Mayor Shepherd reported the City Attorney would review all proposed
language.

Council Member Schmid inquired whether Staff would accept a Council
Motion with urgency under Section 10.50.040.

Council Member Burt commented that the Council could move to initiate an
RPP District and include the words "with urgency."

Ms. Gitelman replied yes.

MOTION AS AMENDED PASSED: 9-0

14.   PUBLIC HEARING: Resolution 9473 entitled â€œResolution of the Council
      of the City of Palo Alto Establishing a Residential Preferential Parking
      (RPP) Program in the Downtown Neighborhoods.

Mayor Shepherd recused herself from the item as her husband held a lease
in the Downtown District.
