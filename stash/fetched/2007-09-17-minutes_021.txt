Council Member Morton said he would vote for the original Motion as well.

Vice Mayor Klein said he has tried to be specific in the Substitute Motion by
saying the general approach is being approved in principle. As for the
comment that Council Member Mossar made about mandatory programs, we
are not adopting any specific programs.

Council Member Cordell said she would support the Substitute Motion
because she believes it is imperative direction be given to staff and the
original motion does not do that. For the benefit of staff, if nothing else, the
substitute motion is important.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION PASSED:             5-4, Barton, Beecham, Morton, Mossar
no.

Assistant City Manager Emily Harrison clarified the assignments do not have
to be completed before discussions begin about the new waste hauling
contract because staff will return and will have detail of the elements to the
Zero Waste in the refuse hauling contract.
