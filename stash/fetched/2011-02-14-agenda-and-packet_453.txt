            A.        No Numerical Emission Limit for PM 2.5




                                                                                                                                                  Attachment: PA Comments EPA HQ-OAR-2009-0559_Final (1297 : EPA Proposed Rule on Sewage Sludge Incinerators)
        NACWA supports EPA’s determination not to include an emission standard for PM2.5 due to the
potential interferences with moisture from scrubber controls. It is reasonable for EPA to control both total and
fine particulate by using surrogates because the use of wet scrubbers is not always compatible with OTM 27.
Entrained water droplets that occur when stack gas moisture levels exceed vapor capacity can bias PM2.5 particle
measurements and provide inaccurate readings of filterable PM2.5. It would be unreasonable for EPA to include
emission limits that are not subject to accurate measurement. Furthermore, the same control devices would be
required to control both total and final particulate. Cf. Nat’l Lime Assoc. v. EPA, 233 F.3d 625, 637 (D.C. Cir. 2000)
(citing Dithiocarbamate Task Force v. EPA, 98 F.3d 1394, 1399 (D.C. Cir. 1996)).

        Limits on filterable particulate matter and opacity provide an adequate surrogate for direct fine
particulate matter contributing to PM2.5. There is also a demonstrated correlation between reductions in SO2
and NOx and reductions in nitrate and sulfate contributions to PM2.5.21 Therefore, the reductions in SO2 and
NOx resulting from these emission limits will also serve to reduce contributions to PM2.5. Given the technical
difficulties with accurately measuring PM2.5 emissions, and the reductions in PM2.5 contributors already
incorporated into the rule, it is reasonable for EPA to use filterable PM10 as a surrogate for PM2.5 emissions.

            B.        No Beyond the Floor Controls for Non-Mercury Pollutants

        NACWA supports EPA’s decision not to impose beyond the floor controls for non-mercury pollutants,
including CO. The 100 ppmv CO limit in Part 503 is not required for all sources; it is one option for
demonstrating compliance with the total hydrocarbon limits contained in the rule. See 40 CFR § 503.40(c)(2).
Thus, Part 503 does not require sources to install afterburners. Any beyond the floor controls for CO imposed
under § 129 would require MH incinerators to retrofit a regenerative thermal oxidizer or other afterburner
device onto existing equipment. EPA estimated that installing an afterburner device would increase the cost of
MACT compliance by over $145 million, and would have uncertain effects on emissions. See ERG Memo,
Analysis of Beyond the Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) Floor Controls for Existing SSI Units at 4-5 &
Attachment C.2 (Aug. 2010). Furthermore, afterburners require the use of supplemental fuel, which EPA
estimates could require annual combustion of an additional 1700 million cubic feet of natural gas. This would
lead to emissions of an additional 84 tons of NOx, 70 tons of CO per year, and an additional amount of
greenhouse gas emissions. See 75 Fed. Reg. at 63277. In light of these determinations, EPA was correct to
eliminate beyond the floor emission limits from the Proposed Rule.

            C.        Flexible Compliance Options

                      1.        Use of Continuous Emission Monitors in Place of Parametric Monitoring and
                                Annual Testing

       NACWA supports flexible compliance options allowing, but not mandating, CEMS for demonstrating
compliance. NACWA also supports allowing sources to propose site-specific operation and maintenance plans
with procedures for addressing missing CEMS data. Providing small entities with a choice of compliance
options is particularly important, as it will allow each POTW to independently assess which compliance option
