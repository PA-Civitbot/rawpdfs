                         TRANSCRIPT
James Keene, City Manager: Just to clarify. I'm assuming that as it relates
to this review, it's both based on how we've gathered feedback of issues and
that review period for people to have the opportunity to comment. We
wouldn't necessarily have to go through detail, detail, detail review. It's
much more of an exception, problematic, what have we heard about things
that aren't working.

Mayor Holman:    Yes, I still have concerns about trees.   Council Member
Scharff...

Council Member Scharff: It should say, "Staff will return with updates to
these Ordinances with any concerns that have been raised within 18
months." It should say what the updates should be. We're not mandating
that you update the Ordinance if there's no...

Mayor Holman: That's correct.

Mr. Keene: Thank you.

Mr. Pirnejad: To address your concern, Mayor Holman, our anticipation
would be to prepare an administrative guideline to address some of the
potential inconsistencies in the trees. We could bring that as well.

Mayor Holman: The Amendment should read "with any concerns generated
by the Ordinances."

MOTION AS AMENDED PASSED: 9-0

Mayor Holman: Thank you to Staff. It's a lot of hard work. Also thanks to
Policy and Services. Thank you.

Council Member Burt: It's after 11:00.

Mayor Holman: This has already been continued once.

Council Member Burt: We have a policy on how we address commencing
items after a certain hour, right?

Mayor Holman: Let me ask Council Members. We have one member of the
public who is here to speak to this item. This has already been continued
once. Are Council Members willing to stay? In the Bay Area Water Supply
and Conservation Agency (BAWSCA) item, there is a May meeting coming
up.    We could put this on the next agenda, though, the BAWSCA
appointment.
