ORAL COMMUNICATIONS

Bill Burruss, owner of Know Knew Books for 23 years opposed the lane
reduction on California Avenue and believed Staff mishandled the project.
Concerning Staff, he said they sent a memo with the wrong address for the
meeting last week and, as a result, some merchants were not able to attend
that meeting. The meeting was attended by a large number of California
Avenue merchants, none of whom approved of the lane reduction. He
stated that Staff had not solicited his opinion of the project. The lane
reduction would congest the area. Fewer lanes could create issues in an
emergency and drive customers away from the area.

Bill Herbert, owner of property on California Avenue since the early 1960s,
said he had not received information on the revitalization of California
Avenue or the lane change. He thought it was wrong of the City of Palo Alto
not to inform people who owned property and had paid taxes in the City for
more than 60 years. He opposed two lanes. He thought it would be
advisable to do a trial by blocking one lane on each side to determine if it
would work.

Philippe Lehot, owner of Journeys Caf√© stated he opposed the proposal. He
knew of at least one nearby business which only had delivery service to their
front door.    At the recent meeting, he asked Staff about how many
businesses were in that situation; they did not know. He stated traffic had
not been studied correctly.
