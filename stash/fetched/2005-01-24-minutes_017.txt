percent to approximately 24 percent of total expense. Over the next ten
years, employee salaries and benefits were expected to grow from
approximately 63 percent to approximately 69 percent of total expenses.
The growth was primarily due to retiree pension contributions, having
doubled to $11 million in the past few years, and health care costs, which
had increased by approximately 50 percent or $10.8 million in 2005. In the
next ten years, health care costs were expected to double again. Due to the
cyclical nature of the business cycle, staff anticipated a recession to occur in
2010.

Mr. Yeats said Palo Alto was presently looking at a $1.5 million imbalance for
2004-05. For 2005-06, staff anticipated a deficit of approximately $5.2
million. If nothing were done to correct the deficit in the next budget cycle or
during the 2005-07 budget, the City would face deficit spending for the
subsequent nine years. For 2004-05, the shortfall was mainly caused by
lower building permit activity, as well as a delay in the Paramedic Basic Life
Support (BLS) program. At the time the City’s budget was adopted, the
State had not adopted its budget, which left a $500,000 takeaway. In
addition, there had been a number of budget amendment ordinances from
the City Attorney’s office for litigation. Both of those items would be
incorporated into the mid-year budget. The 2005-06 shortfall was primarily
caused by: 1) lower building permit fees; 2) a delay in full implementation of
the paramedic program; 3) lower sales and TOT tax revenues; 4) additional
State takeaways of approximately $500,000; 5) an increase in the California
Public Employees Retirement System (CALPERS) retirement rates of
approximately $1.3 million; and 6) funding for the Technology Fund. Staff
made a commitment to the Council they would continue to fund the City’s
infrastructure at a certain level. More had been funded in certain years than
the target of $2 million per year. For the next few years, including the
current year, staff would not be able to make that commitment because of
an insufficient surplus of revenues over expenditures. At the end of the
2005-07 budget cycle, the goal was to have enough savings to begin the
process of refunding infrastructure into the future. Currently, the General
Fund was subsidizing or transferring funds to the Storm Drain Fund at
approximately $800,000 per year. If the Storm Drain Fee did not increase,
that trend would continue. The $800,000 was built into the LRFP. The State’s
financial condition was forever changing. The passage of Proposition 1A gave
the City a little breather; however, it was anticipated the State would
become more creative in how local governments were funded. In 2013, the
Refuse Fund would cease paying rent on the landfill, which was
approximately $4.5 million. In the long-term, as staff looked at funding
strategies, a revenue source would be needed to fill that gap in 2014.

City Manager Frank Benest said because there was not one overall solution
to solve the problem, staff anticipated doing a variety of things and coming
