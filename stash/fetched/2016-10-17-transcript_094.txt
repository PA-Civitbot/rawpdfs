Council Member Holman: In SOFA II.

Vice Mayor Scharff: Right, in SOFA II.

Council Member Holman: Liz, is that okay with you?

Mayor Burt: Liz?

Council Member Kniss: I thought we had a medical office size that we had
agreed on. Maybe I've just forgotten. A 5,000 ...

Mayor Burt: I think there are SOFA restrictions on it. I'm not recalling what
they are.

Council Member Kniss: I thought that's what it was.         That's why I'm
hesitating on it.

Council Member Holman: There's an office limitation of 5,000 square feet.

Council Member Kniss: Medical office.

Council Member Holman: That's office generally.

Mayor Burt: Why don't we just leave it open enough for Staff to come back
with clarification on existing medical office and recommendations.

Council Member Holman: That's kind of what's up here.

AMENDMENT RESTATED AND INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION
WITH THE CONSENT OF THE MAKER AND SECONDER to add to the
Motion, “direct Staff to return with a recommendation on medical office size
in SOFA II.” (New Part F)

Council Member Kniss:      This is recommendation.     That's where I was
hesitating.

Mayor Burt: As long as they understand the recommendation could be—
they come back with clarification (inaudible) we already got restrictions and
we recommend we retain them. They could do that. On the fly right now,
we don't have the research on what's there.

Council Member Holman: Exactly. The definition of retail would be the sale
of goods. Did Staff want comment on that now or is that the subsequent
Ordinance?
