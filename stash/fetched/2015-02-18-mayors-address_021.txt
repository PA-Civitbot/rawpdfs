More inclusive, more concise staff reports: more informed decision making

We have a very dedicated, hard-working, experienced staff. And there are times when
Council seems to want some information not currently in staff reports which we think will
lead to more informed and more expeditious decision making.

A strong community value is civic engagement. Toward that end and thanks to staff, the
City has implemented earlier release of Council Packets, now released a full 11 days
before Council meetings. This is much appreciated and a great help.

To even further support the decision making process through balanced and complete
staff reports, we are looking forward to working with staff on ways to improve the
process such as the inclusion of options, more easily consumed tables and charts, and
reducing the need for as much prose.

Architectural Review reform

Well known has been and is my concern about a more responsive built environment.

And a favorite quote is this:

    “Architecture is static music.” Goethe

Our buildings are the most pronounced, the most long lasting outward expression of
who we are. Therefore, the City should evaluate the review process with a goal of
providing architecture that enriches our daily experience.

People do not experience buildings in terms of numbers: Floor Area Ratio or Density.
How they relate to buildings and the cityscape is more of an emotional reaction. And
then there are also, of course, the reactions to impacts such as traffic and parking.

There have been some noteworthy articles, in the New York Times for instance, about
how current architectural trends are not being embraced by the public. This is not purely
a Palo Alto phenomenon. Nevertheless, we do need to reconnect the aesthetic of our
built community, our architecture, with the public.
