property from CD-N(P) and CD-C(P) to allow a mixed office and retail, four-
story, 50-foot tall building (and 70 foot tall corner tower feature) on the
former Shell Station site located at 355 and 335 Alma Street. The PC
Ordinance would grant exceptions to the daylight plane and 35-foot height
limit within 150 feet of residential property; 2) in the Ordinance, under (f)
Public Benefits, subsection (1) a Financial contribution of $625,000 to the
City of Palo Alto’s affordable housing program (in addition to the required
$850,000 commercial in lieu fee); 3) in the Ordinance, under (f) Public
Benefits, subsection (2), a financial contribution of $625,000 to the City’s
parking fund and payment of $1,476,200 to cover the cost of 22 in lieu
parking spaces (at $67,100 per space); 4) inclusion of 3,807 square feet of
ground floor retail uses and eating and drinking services; 5) the non-profit
office space shall be for the life of the project; 6) provision of Caltrain GO
Passes, Eco Passes or the equivalent; and 7) TDM/GO Pass compliance: add
to Section 4(d) of Ordinance and Condition Number 3, the following
language:     “additionally, an agreement for compliance with targeted
reductions (minimum 20% parking reduction) shall be developed between
the owners and the City specifying a penalty schedule for non-compliance,
graduated over the initial five years of the project and then for every five
years thereafter, and tied to equivalent fees for in lieu parking. The
agreement shall be in effect prior to building occupancy and shall be
recorded to apply to subsequent owners as well."

That would leave a financial contribution of $625,000 to the Affordable
Housing Program in addition to the required $850,000 for the commercial in
lieu fee.
