Ms. Gitelman was concerned that the Council was drafting a set of
regulations that was inconsistent with Zoning Ordinances and Districts. The
inconsistency could be resolved in the long-term ordinance.

Council Member Burt indicated an interim ordinance's purpose was to hold
things as they were. It would prevent significant degradation of retail while
the Council crafted a long-term ordinance. He questioned whether a pipeline
application that had not been presented to a Board or Commission should be
exempt from the interim ordinance.

Council Member Scharff requested Staff provide the status of those three
pipeline projects.

Council Member Burt asked if the three pipeline projects had received Board
or Commission approval.

Mayor Holman noted one of the pipeline projects was 429 University Avenue.

Council Member Burt noted that project had received approval.

Ms. French reported there had not been a hearing of the Compadre's site at
3877 El Camino Real. Many projects had gone through preliminary reviews,
but had not gone through the entitlement process.

Council Member Burt asked if preliminary review was the same as review by
a Board or Commission.

Ms. French explained that the Architectural Review Board (ARB) conducted
preliminary review of designs.

Mayor Holman inquired whether the ARB had conducted preliminary reviews
only of the Compadre's site.

Ms. French answered yes.

Council Member Burt asked if other projects which had undergone
preliminary review resulted in a reduction of retail.

Ms. Gitelman clarified that the three projects had pending entitlement
applications. That did include ARB preliminary review. An ARB preliminary
review did not provide a project with entitlement.

Council Member Burt stated that three projects had received Board and
Commission approval which constituted preliminary entitlement.
