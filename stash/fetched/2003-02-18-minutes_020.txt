expanded version. She advised the Council not to discuss the matter any
further.

MOTION: Council Member Freeman moved, seconded by Lytle, to hear the
appeal expeditiously at a special meeting.

Council Member Freeman said she was concerned about not having an
expeditious result to the issue. A special meeting with the applicants and the
appellants would devote more time to the matter.

Council Member Lytle favored a special meeting to ensure an appropriate
amount of attention to it. She asked whether a site visit to 1849 Webster
Street could be arranged.

Mr. Benest said yes.

Mr. Calonne said there would be a special meeting notice for a public
hearing. Staff would need the property owner's consent in order to allow the
public to go on the property.

Mr. Benest suggested having staff work with Mayor Mossar to identify when
to put it on a regular Council meeting.

Council Member Beecham said he was comfortable to see if staff could fit in
the appeal hearing in a short amount of time.

Council Member Burch was concerned about having the appeal heard
expeditiously and finding the time to schedule and conduct a site visit.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION: Council Member Morton moved, seconded by
Beecham, to direct staff to schedule the hearing as soon as possible.

Council Member Freeman asked why the appeal needed to be heard at a
regular meeting instead of a special meeting.

Mr. Benest said it was the decision of the Council whether the appeal would
be heard at a regular or special Council meeting.

Council Member Freeman asked whether there was rationale behind having
it heard at a regular meeting.

Mr. Benest said it would be hard to get all nine Council Members together
and it required 12 days notice for scheduling.
