competitive solicitation requirements, “. . . in fact, City will give preference
to non-proprietary systems where possible to reduce use of non-competitive
contracts.”

AMENDMENT: Council Member Kishimoto moved, seconded by Cordell, to
make a recommendation, where appropriate and where possible, regarding
proprietary systems that encourages the City to pursue non-proprietary
systems so that it is not locked into contracting with a particular vendor.

Mr. Perez stated he had concerns the City would possibly be made to work
with a non-proprietary vendor.

Director of Administrative Services Carl Yeats said sole sourcing was used
when a standard was necessary.

Vice Mayor Burch said whether sole source or non-proprietary, it should be
whatever worked best for the City. He would not support the amendment.

Council Member Morton said most developed products would be proprietary.
He would not support the amendment.

Council Member Kishimoto said she did not want to override the staff’s
judgment.

Bob Smith, 2291 Greer Road, said the amendment was inappropriate, as the
best purchase could end up being proprietary.

AMENDMENT FAILED 2-7 Kishimoto, Freeman “yes.”

Ms. Erickson said establishing a preference would have made it difficult to
administer.   She assured Council that staff would use the suggestion
internally when making Request for Proposals (RFP) or bids for software.

Mayor Beecham said the vote by Council did not indicate an approval for
proprietary systems.

Council Member Freeman said the previous vote was not limited to software.
She had concerns with the fair and open process. The amount the City
Manager or designee should have the ability to sign for should be limited to
$100,000.

MOTION: Council Member Freeman moved that the Policy and Services
(P&S) Committee review the policy and provide recommendations for
Disadvantaged Business Enterprises (DBE) owned businesses.
