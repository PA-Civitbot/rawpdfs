    •    Intersection Level of Service (LOS)

    •    Independent Roadway Operations Analysis of the city-prepared plan line concept for
         California Avenue.

Intersection Level of Service Analysis
Intersection LOS is a measurement of "delay" to progress through an intersection based on the
intersection control type. For example, intersections with signalized controls such as California
Avenue & EI Camino Real are measured differently in terms of the amount of acceptable delay
compared to intersections with All-Way STOP-controls such as California Avenue & Ash St.
Intersection LOS is measured by letter grades on a scale of LOS-A to LOS-F, with LOS-A
representing little to no delay by motorists and LOS-F representing unacceptable delays.

The TIA analyzed seven "study intersections" at varying times of day to determine how the
proposed 4-lane to 2-lane study would impact intersection operations along California Avenue
and adjacent streets. In general, a significant impact occurs when a project causes an intersection
or roadway segment to deteriorate below LOS-D. Any significant changes in LOS between
existing (4-lane) and project (2-lane) conditions may also serve as an indicator of potential
"shifting of traffic" from California Avenue to adjacent streets such as Cambridge Avenue or
Sherman Avenue. The Intersection LOS study intersections and their control-type are noted
below:

        No.         Intersection Name                                Control Type
         1          California Avenue & EI Camino Real               Traffic Signal
         2          California Avenue & Ash Street                   All-Way Stop
         3          California Avenue & Birch Street                 All-Way Stop
         4          California Avenue & Park Blvd (West)             All-Way Stop
         5          California Avenue & Park Blvd (East)             All-Way Stop
         6          Cambridge Avenue & Birch Street                  All-Way Stop
         7          Sherman Avenue & Birch Street                    All-Way Stop



The intersection LOS findings, provided in Table 2, show that the 4-lane to 2-lane reduction on
California Avenue between EI Camino Real and the Park Blvd Plaza do not result in any
significant Level of Service impacts to the study intersections. As a result, no anticipated
shifting of traffic from California Avenue to adjacent parallel streets such as Carrlbridge Avenue
or Sherman Avenue is expected if the street is restriped to two lanes.
