$60,000 roughly, 2016 $8,900.      For 2017, we have $88,000 budgeted.               I
couldn't resist asking.

Mr. Perez: It was probably to close it down. We'll have to look.

Vice Mayor Scharff: You can get back to me on it. I was just curious as to
what that was for. Thanks.

Mayor Burt: I don't see any other lights. We'll thank the Staff and the
Finance Committee in advance for a month of hard work ahead. I know the
Staff's beenâ€”their hard work on this doesn't start tonight. Maybe the next
month is actually easier than the last few months. You have a lot of
meetings coming up. Thank you all for this hard work in this coming month.
On that note, we will conclude this item.

8.    Colleagues Memo: Developing City Policy on Acquisition, Use, and
      Safeguards for Surveillance and Information-Gathering Technologies.

Mayor Burt: We'll move on to our final item tonight, which is a Colleagues

Council Member Wolbach: Also when there's an opportunity to make a
Motion, I'd appreciate it if I could do that. This Colleagues Memo is really
about beginning the process of establishing a proactive policy to ensure
transparency in City government when it comes to technology with
surveillance or privacy concerns and about protecting Personally Identifiable
Information, PII. This is in the context of rapidly evolving technology, which
enables unprecedented opportunities but also potential risks. This is in the
context of controversies at the national, state and local level, which Palo Alto
should aim to avoid. This is not about regulating private uses of technology,
only uses by the City or our contractors or partners. I'd say this is also not
