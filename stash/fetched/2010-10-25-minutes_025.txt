Ms. Caporgno stated the EIR had focused the compatibility discussion to the
mitigation measures with the four components which would be the
determination for compatibility. There were suggestions in the EIR as to how
the mitigations could be met.

Council Member Holman stated if a building was demolished prior to the new
construction beginning, the site was left as a patch of dirt and weeds. She
asked why there needed to be a 60 day demolition schedule.

Council Member Klein stated the process needed to move forward quickly
and presenting a timeline gave the perception of an end time.

AMENDMENT: Council Member Holman moved, seconded by Council
Member XXX to delete the demolition prior to the approval of the permits.

AMENDMENT FAILED DUE TO LACK OF A SECOND

City Attorney, Gary Baum noted there was a change to Section 4 to read
“the City Council hereby finds the Environmental Impact has been reduced
to a level less significant due to incorporation of the mitigation measure as
listed in the mitigation monitoring check list including mitigation measure 4-
1”.

Mayor Burt asked for an estimated timeframe for Staff to return the
improved process to Council with the adopted changes.

Mr. Williams stated Staff could return to Council with a report showing the
key components within three months.

MOTION PASSED: 8-1 Holman no
