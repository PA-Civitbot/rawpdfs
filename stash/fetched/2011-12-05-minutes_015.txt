Mr. Emslie reminded the City Council that state law prohibited using excess
fees and revenues on items other than services.

Mr. Keene indicated a year-end review would show an increase in the
Reserve due to a greater inflow of revenues.
Council Member Schmid asked if Staff would be willing to accept increasing
the public-opinion score of land use planning and zoning as a metric of
success of the program.

Mr. Keene stated he believed scores of 80 percent to 90 percent would never
be achieved in this realm.

Council Member Schmid indicated this was a general survey.

Mr. Keene stated it was. He stated there had been increases over the prior
year in sub-measures within the Development Center Land Use area
indicating improvement. He indicated the metrics used would be sharpened
and further defined over time.

Mayor Espinosa indicated comments from business leaders about the new
process were complimentary.

Mr. Keene stated the new process was easier to accomplish with targeted
projects and the goal was to make the process routine across the City.
