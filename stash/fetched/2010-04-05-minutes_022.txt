Council Member Scharff asked whether the lease revenue being referred to
was the revenue on the land once it was undedicated and asked at whose
discretion.

Mr. Roberts stated there was a current evaluation methodology used to
establish the basis of value and the rent would be set on the evaluation basis
used for the balance of the parkland.

Council Member Scharff asked if there were other options for evaluating the
rent basis.

Mr. Roberts stated it was a Council policy choice of whether to charge rent or
not and there had to be a methodology to configure the value base.

Mayor Burt stated the evaluation of the land would pertain wherever that
revenue would be directed toward, so it would be a part of the feasibility
study.

Vice Mayor Espinosa stated all of the advisory panels recommended moving
in a regional manner with the composting effort. The proposed project
required eight acres without mentioning the amount of acreage necessary to
separate the facility from the park.
