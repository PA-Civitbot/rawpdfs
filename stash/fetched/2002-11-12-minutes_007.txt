Council Member Kishimoto stated she would “abstain” on Item No. 5.

Council Member Kleinberg stated she would vote “no” on Item No. 5.

Council Member Lytle stated she would vote “no” on Item Nos. 4 and 5.

MOTION: Council Member Morton moved, seconded by Burch, to approve
Consent Calendar Item Nos. 2-6.

Council Member Kleinberg said regarding Item No. 5 she wanted to see the
reconsideration of Council’s vote to establish the policy not requiring
prevailing wage and where the policy came from.

Mayor Ojakian asked the City Attorney to provide the information to the
Council as a whole. He said an item would need to be agendized to be
reconsidered and would take two Council Members to get consideration.

City Attorney Ariel Calonne said he could not provide the information on the
cost impact. The reason why the City did not do this in the past was because
it was not required by law and very costly to research. He would need help
to analyze the cost.

Council Member Kleinberg said she did not need the information
immediately. It was something that was raised by Council over the last few
years.

Mr. Calonne said it was not a simple issue and asked Council to agendize the
item for reconsideration.
