consider that the height is generally not to exceed fifty feet, and Staff is to
perhaps explore and return with exceptions within 1/4 mile of fixed rail
transit stations.

Council Member Scharff stated there needed to be flexibility to look at the
fifty foot height limit in the area of the fixed rail stations, which was a
limited area.

Council Member Schmid asked for clarification on whether the exception was
within a quarter mile of transit or transit stations.

Council Member Scharff stated transit stations.

Council Member Klein stated he did not support the Motion.

Council Member Scharff stated the intent of the Motion was for Staff to
explore the options and return to Council for a decision on which direction
would best suit the City.

Council Member Klein stated Staff came to Council for guidance and the
Motion was without guidance.

Mayor Burt clarified asking Staff and the Planning & Transportation
Commission (P&TC) to evaluate a process was guidance. He noted
historically the fifty foot height limit was of concern for the community.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER           to delete the word “perhaps”, and change
“explore” to “evaluate”, and include the wording “limited exceptions” after
explore.

Council Member Holman stated she did not support the Motion. She stated
once an exception was allowed there tended to be increasing slow progress
towards extended exceptions. Compatibility was imperative moving forward.

Council Member Shepherd suggested expanding the study to include the
High Speed Rail (HSR).

Council Member Price stated she supported the Motion with the incorporated
language.

Council Member Klein stated if the Motion was adopted, the City was
undercutting the use of the bottom-up argument on the Regional Housing
Needs Allocation (RHNA) numbers.
