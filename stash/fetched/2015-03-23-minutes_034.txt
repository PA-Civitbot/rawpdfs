Council Member Berman asked if Council Members could offer alternative
options to the Comprehensive Plan to study.

Mayor Holman responded yes.

MOTION: Council Member Berman moved, seconded by Council Member
Scharff to direct Staff to include an alternative of no new net trip increase in
the Comprehensive Plan update.

Council Member Berman believed the Council could best address traffic and
parking issues through policies that incentivized reduction of single
occupancy vehicle trips. That type of alternative would address the issue
and incentivize resources to achieve those goals.

Council Member Scharff agreed with Council Member Berman.              A
Comprehensive Plan Update should consider alternatives. The Santa Monica
model was worthy of study. He wanted to understand how a program would
work and what it would look like.

Council Member Wolbach offered an Amendment to change the wording to
add “single occupancy vehicle” between the words “net” and “trip”.

Council Member Scharff felt single occupancy vehicle was better.

Council Member Wolbach would accept either single occupancy vehicle or the
word car.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH CONSENT OF THE MAKER
AND SECONDER: add "car" between "net" and "trip."

Council Member Burt could support the language if it was not framed as an
alternative to constraining office growth.

Council Member Filseth asked if that would replace the limit the Council just
agreed on.

Council Member Scharff stated the Council had not agreed on a limit in the
Comprehensive Plan.

Council Member Filseth hoped an alternative would actually result in a no net
car trip increase.
