Association.    I want to underscore that the action before you tonight
represents a significant improvement to the continuum of the billing,
invoicing, collections and budgeting process for the BID. With that, Russ
and I are here to entertain any questions that you might have after you
open the public hearing.

Mayor Holman: This is the time and place for the public hearing on the levy
of an assessment on businesses in the Palo Alto Downtown Business
Improvement District for Fiscal Year 2016. In February 2004, the City
established the Palo Alto Downtown Business Improvement District.
Annually, the City Council must hold a public hearing to authorize the levy of
an assessment in the next fiscal year. On May 18, 2015, the Council set
aside this time and day as the time and date of the public hearing on the
proposed levy of an assessment for this fiscal year of 2016. The Council
appointed the Board of Directors of the Palo Alto Downtown Business and
Professional Association as the Advisory Board for the BID. The Advisory
Board has prepared its Annual Report for the 2016 Fiscal Year and submitted
it to the Council.    The City published the required noticed in a local
newspaper of record regarding reauthorization of the BID for 2016 as
required by bid law. All interested persons have an opportunity to provide
testimony this evening. I have no cards at this point in time. At the
conclusion of the public hearing, the Council will determine whether a
majority protest exists. A majority protest will exist if the owners of
businesses that will pay 50 percent or more of the proposed levy of an
assessment have filed and not withdrawn a written protest.

Public Hearing opened and closed without public comment at 7:55 P.M.

Mayor Holman: Determination of the existence of a majority protest.

Mr. Fehrenbach: No majority protest exists, Madam Mayor.

Mayor Holman: in the absence of a majority protest, motion to approve?

Vice Mayor Schmid: I move that we approve a resolution confirming the
report of the Advisory Board and levying an assessment for Fiscal Year 2016
on the Downtown Palo Alto Business Improvement District; that we also
approve a Budget Amendment Ordinance for Fiscal Year 2016 reducing the
revenue estimate by $40,000 from $140,000 to $100,000, and reducing the
Expenditure Budget by $11,800 from $148,000 to $136,000 for the Business
Improvement District offset with a reduction of the projected ending fund
balance of $28,200.

Council Member Filseth: Second.
