Vice Mayor Kniss asked if the City preferred the location be designated as a
"Sender Site" rather than the History Museum utilize the building.

Ms. Stump remarked that determining the location to be a "Sender Site" was
a policy question for the Council. The Council did not have to designate it as
a "Sender Site."

Vice Mayor Kniss commented that the historical building would need to be
brought up to the Secretary's Standards in order to use it.

Ms. Stump advised that was a separate issue from the sale of TDRs.

Council Member Schmid understood that the TDR market had been very
active. He inquired whether the City kept records of TDR sales and their
values.

Mr. Stump reported Staff had made some efforts to compile a complete
record. The Code contained requirements to document both sending and
receiving sites for TDRs. Staff was being careful about recording those now.

Council Member Schmid noted TDR sales were registered with the Planning
Department, and asked about the time period Staff had been documenting
sales.

Ms. Stump did not know historically. Current Staff was very careful about
documenting and recording TDRs.

Mr. Ghaemmaghami added that the value of TDRs exchanged in the
marketplace probably had not been reported to the City. People did not
disclose the sale price of TDRs.

Council Member Schmid commented that Staff might have the number of
square feet transferred but not the value. He inquired whether there was a
list of qualified sites even if they had not been approved.

Mr. Perez could not answer that.

Council Member Schmid asked if Staff could estimate the market for TDRs
with no information.

Mr. Perez indicated Staff had received a few calls over the past few years
inquiring about the City going to market with TDRs. Therefore, Staff knew
there was some demand for TDRS.
