COUNCIL MATTERS

19A. Council Members Hillary Freeman and Judy Kleinberg re Semi-Annual
     Reporting by Palo Alto Police Department on Demographic Data

Council Member Freeman said she received a reply to her memo from
Interim Police Chief Lynne Johnson. The reply answered all the questions in
her memo and she asked how the matter would return to the Council.

Mr. Benest replied after Ms. Johnson and her staff completed the analysis
and evaluation of the current data, as well as some of the other activities
she had identified, staff would return with a report to the Council. Staff
would propose to do some certain things depending on what that analysis
and evaluation contained.

Council Member Freeman asked whether there would be a report in June on
that information.

Mr. Benest replied yes.
