      Work Program to Produce a Work Product to Support an Integrated
      Policy Discussion on Landfill Closure and Byxbee Park-Phase II

Council Member Mossar stated the memo was intended to ask staff to let the
Council know what it would take to come to Council prepared to have an
integrated discussion related to the Baylands, since it was currently not in
their work program.

MOTION: Council Member Mossar moved, seconded by Drekmeier, to direct
staff to return to the December 3, 2007 Council Meeting with a proposed
work plan, including a timeline and information on how current projects
would be re-prioritized in order to accommodate this new assignment.

Council Member Drekmeier said the goal was to take a comprehensive look
at all of the different projects going on involving the Baylands as a unit.

Mayor Kishimoto stated the purpose of the two step process was to give
enough time to explain the resources and costs.

for staff to return to Council.

to return with staff resources, reviewing revenue and financial implications.
