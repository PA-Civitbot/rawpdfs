Ms. Silver offered a new sentence be added to Section 10.50.070(e)a, "prior
to adoption the Director shall conduct a public-noticed meeting soliciting
input on such guidelines."

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to Add a sentence to Section 10.50.070(e)a:
"Prior to adoption, the Director shall conduct a public-noticed meeting
soliciting input on such guidelines."

Council Member Scharff wanted Section 10.50.70(d)(7) to include some
language for community events.

Ms. Silver reported Staff did discuss that at a policy level. Most events
seemed to occur in the evenings and on weekends when most regulations
likely would not be in effect. Staff could address any specific daytime events
as directed by the Council.

Council Member Scharff requested Staff prepare language to include private
organizations.

Mayor Shepherd felt the purpose of RPP Districts was to regulate parking
during the work week.

Council Member Scharff explained that provisions of an RPP District could
regulate parking on weekends.

Council Member Price believed that would impact enforcement.

Council Member Scharff wished to include language previously discussed of
"no person shall park a vehicle adjacent to any curb in violation of any
posted or noticed prohibition or restriction."

Ms. Gitelman asked if Council Member Scharff would accept striking the
reference to schools from Section 10.50.70(d)(7).

Council Member Scharff would accept that. Staff should discuss the
exemption with PAUSD and determine whether five events was an
appropriate number.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to delete reference to schools from Section
10.50.70(d)(7).

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to delete "stop" and "stand" from Section
