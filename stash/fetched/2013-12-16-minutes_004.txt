CONSENT CALENDAR

Roger McCarthy urged the Council not to deny the appeal of the 636
Waverley Street Project. The Project was a volumetric cube designed to
maximize the economic value of the building. The lack of compatibility was
obvious.

David Kleinman indicated the Architectural Review Board (ARB) deliberated
carefully regarding the 636 Waverley Street Project. The Architect made
changes in accordance with ARB requests. The Council should support the
ARB decision and approve the Project. The Appellant obviously preferred a
different architectural style.

Council Member Burt questioned whether allowing public comment regarding
a Consent Item that could be removed was proper.

Mayor Scharff understood public comment was allowed for items on the
Consent Calendar.

Council Member Burt inquired about the sequence for Council Members
removing items from the Consent Calendar.

Molly Stump, City Attorney, did not recall that Council rules were specific as
to sequence. Members of the public must be allowed to speak on the
Consent Calendar as a whole. If a member of the public spoke regarding an
item that was removed, there was no need to provide him a second
opportunity to speak. If the Council did hear an item following formal appeal
procedures, then the timeframe for the Appellant and Applicant would be
different. Perhaps the Council could entertain removal of an item from the
Consent Calendar.

MOTION: Council Member Holman moved, seconded by Council Member
Schmid, third by Council Member xx to pull Item Number 7 from the Consent
Calendar.

MOTION FAILED DUE TO LACK OF A THIRD

Council Member Holman asked when she would be allowed to speak to Item
Number 7.

Ms. Stump reported a Council Member could take a few minutes to explain a
no vote after the vote.

MOTION: Council Member Schmid moved, seconded by Council Member
Holman, third by Council Member Burt to move Agenda Item Number 10
