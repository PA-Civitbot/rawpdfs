Oral Communications

Nancy Krep, Sixth District Parent Teacher Association and Palo Alto Unified
School District Parent Teacher Council, urged the Council to approve the City
Manager's recommendation to release $8 million for preservation of Buena
Vista Mobilehome Park. The PTA supported the children of Buena Vista
Mobilehome Park.

Erika Escalante, Buena Vista Mobilehome Park Residents Association,
advised that Buena Vista Mobilehome Park was an affordable and safe place
to live and raise children. Residents of Buena Vista were an important part
of Palo Alto. Many residents worked in Palo Alto and at Stanford University.
She urged the Council to release funds for purchase of Buena Vista
Mobilehome Park as soon as appropriate.

Lisa Kenkel, Law Foundation of Silicon Valley Board Member, supported
homeowners of Buena Vista Mobilehome Park. She urged the Council to
ratify the City Manager's setting aside of $8 million for Buena Vista
Mobilehome Park.

Vice Mayor Schmid encouraged the public to share their opinions with the
Council. The Council would hold a hearing on the appeal of the closure
application for Buena Vista Mobilehome Park on April 13 and 14, 2015. The
Council was obligated to remain neutral, fair, and open-minded during that
appeal hearing. The City could comment on possible actions only after that
hearing was held.
