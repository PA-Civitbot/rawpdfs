Ms. Stump: Thank you, Council Member Kniss. There is a proposed PC
zoning violation penalty in the material that's before you. It's on Packet
Page 63. If you follow down on the left, it's 18.38.020, Planned Community
zoning unless otherwise specified in PC Ordinance. It provides for $2,000
beginning on the 181st day following notice of violation. We would note that
under the general structure of the administrative scale—my colleague,
Albert, will correct me if I'm wrong—that $2,000 beginning on the 181st day
doubles again then subsequently. It does provide for—what's proposed is up
to $4,000. If the Council wanted to amend that to some other number—
many members of the public have talked about $5,000—you could do that
by changing that $2,000 to $2,500.

Mr. Keene: For City Attorney, the Council could do that this evening. Is
that correct? As opposed to directing the Staff to come back with that, they
could do it this evening.

Ms. Stump: Yes.

Council Member Kniss: That was my question. When the time comes,
Mr. Mayor, I would be glad to move in that direction. Some of you are
looking expectant, like why don't I do it right this minute. I will look for help
with the language from Molly Stump.           I would move that looking at
18.38.020, we look at amending that from the $2,000, which is allowed at
this point, to $2,500.

Mayor Burt: Council Member Kniss, unless we want a separate Motion for
this, what we'd want to do is …

Vice Mayor Scharff: Adopt the whole thing.

Mayor Burt: … a Motion to adopt the entire …

Council Member Berman: Schedule.

Mayor Burt: … schedule with whatever amendment you would recommend.

Council Member Kniss: Then let me do it in reverse. I will then suggest that
we adopt the entire Resolution in front of us this evening and additionally
add that we change the $2,000 to $2,500 under the PC. Thank you for
getting us to that point where we can go to the $5,000.

Vice Mayor Scharff: Second.

MOTION: Council Member Kniss moved, seconded by Vice Mayor Scharff to
adopt a Resolution amending the Administrative Penalty Schedule to update
