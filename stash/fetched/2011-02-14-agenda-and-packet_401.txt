percent O2, or (b) multiplying raw (uncorrected) concentration data by uncorrected flue
gas flow rate data. By using corrected concentration and uncorrected flue gas flow rate
data, ERG overestimated CCCSD emissions by 77 percent. A detailed spreadsheet
illustrating this error is included in CCCSD’s comment letter.




                                                                                                            Attachment: PA Comments EPA HQ-OAR-2009-0559_Final (1297 : EPA Proposed Rule on Sewage Sludge Incinerators)
ERG’s error in using uncorrected flue gas flow rate data with corrected mercury
concentrations is not limited to the facilities that responded to the ICR, because the
sludge feed rates and flue gas flow rates from these facilities were used to develop “flow
rate factors” in dscfm/dry tons per hour of sludge that were then used in the subsequent
calculation of baseline estimates for the facilities that did not receive the ICR. Therefore,
it appears that the mercury baseline emissions for all SSIs were calculated using
uncorrected flue gas flow rate data and concentration data corrected to 7 percent O2.

In estimating baseline mercury emissions from Palo Alto’s SSIs, the flow rate factors that
were developed resulted in a flue gas flow rate almost 50 percent greater than the actual
measured flowrate. This inflated flowrate was then multiplied by EPA’s assumed
concentration of 0.103 mg/dscm at 7% O2, introducing the error of using uncorrected flue
gas flow rate with corrected concentration. Additionally, Palo Alto’s measured mercury
concentration is about half of EPA’s assumed concentration. These factors combine to
result in a baseline mercury emissions estimate for Palo Alto that is about six times
higher than the actual emissions, as shown in Table 1 below.

* EPA assumed that we operate incinerators half of the year; therefore the EPA estimate for each
incinerator was summed for an annual number.

Assuming similar errors on baseline emissions across the board, USEPA and ERG have
significantly overstated the baseline mercury emissions from SSIs. EPA must reevaluate
baseline emissions, the MACT floor assessment, and the beyond the MACT floor
assessment.
