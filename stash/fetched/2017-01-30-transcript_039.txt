Council Member Filseth: Correct.     Residential is already exempt from it,
because it's nonresidential.

Council Member Wolbach: Actually I will not accept that Amendment.

Council Member Filseth: Then why did you say you would?

Council Member Wolbach: (Inaudible).

Mayor Scharff: Now, we need a second if you have one.

Council Member Filseth: Now, we need a second.

Council Member DuBois: I'd second.

AMENDMENT:      Council Member Filseth moved, seconded by Council
Member DuBois to replace Part C of the Motion with, “retain the existing
Downtown Cap for 45,000 square feet and exempt retail from the Cap.”

Mayor Scharff: Council Member DuBois was seconding that. Would you like
to speak …

Council Member DuBois: Could you just clarify? Are you choosing one of
the four options or are you creating a new Option?

Council Member Filseth:    That's a good question.     Not office/R&D.         The
Downtown cap.

Council Member DuBois: I would support and propose Option 4.

Council Member Filseth: I'll exempt hotels as well. Basically, it limits it to
office/R&D. Which Page are we on?

Mr. Keene: Page 16 in the Packet.

Mayor Scharff: Page 16 or Page 3. Look at this. This is much easier.

Council Member Filseth: I think it's Number 2.

Council Member DuBois: Would you accept an Amendment to make it
Number 4 with the new hotel, additional caps for hotel?

Council Member Filseth: Additional caps for hotels.

Council Member DuBois: I think it was proposed by our Mayor originally.
