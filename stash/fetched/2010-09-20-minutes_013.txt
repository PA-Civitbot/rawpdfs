Mayor Burt stated his critical question was contrary to looking whether our
cost per gallon of container was going up, but what was the City having to
pay for trash removal per household.

Ms. Eyerly stated that was correct and the Cost of Services Study would be
able to assist in pinpointing the increases of costs that were not associated
with a direct fee.

Mr. Baum stated the proceeding was governed by Proposition 218 which
required the City follow specific procedures and specific noticing prior to
increasing any rate. Tonightâ€™s hearing provided an opportunity to those who
wished to protest the proposed rate increase during the hearing.
