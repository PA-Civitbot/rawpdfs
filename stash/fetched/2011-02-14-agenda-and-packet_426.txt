POTW operations. The Solid Waste Disposal Act and RCRA included the DSE in explicit recognition of this
critical policy choice.13

        Indeed, as EPA began its long efforts to define “solid waste” and “hazardous waste” for purposes of
Subtitle C of RCRA, the Agency explicitly understood and discussed the importance of the comprehensive
federal sewage sludge management program. For example, in the 1980 preamble to EPA’s development of the
Subtitle C regulations, EPA describes the importance, scope and ultimate supremacy of the to-be developed
CWA § 405 program, indicating that, once this program was in place, it would serve as the comprehensive
regulatory scheme for use and disposal of sewage sludge. See 45 Fed. Reg. 33084, 33102 (May 19, 1980) (“Once
such a regulation is in place, sewage sludge will be exempted from coverage under other sets of regulations.”).
EPA has similarly interpreted the scope of the DSE to include sewage sludge generated by POTWs in the
preamble to the Agency’s 1990 Final Rule to identify and list hazardous wastes for petroleum refinery process
wastewaters. EPA concluded that POTW sewage sludge falls within the DSE:

         These wastes [P038 and K048 wastes] are being added to the list of [hazardous] wastes . . . in
         order to regulate sludges generated at wastewater treatment facilities on site at petroleum
         refineries as well as sludges generated at off-site wastewater treatment facilities. It should be
         noted that if wastewaters generated at petroleum refineries are discharged to a POTW and such
         wastewaters are mixed with domestic sewage from nonindustrial sources, the sludges generated in
         the POTW are covered under the domestic sewage exclusion and are not included in today’s listings.

         It should be noted that if wastewaters generated at petroleum refineries are discharged to
         a POTW and such wastewaters are mixed with domestic sewage from nonindustrial
         sources, the sludges generated in the POTW are covered under the domestic sewage exclusion and
         are not included in today’s listings.

55 Fed. Reg. 46354, 46364 (Nov. 2, 1990) (emphasis added). Thus, there has been a clear recognition for over 30
years that sewage sludge is different than solid waste for regulatory purposes, and that sewage sludge is
primarily regulated under the CWA, not RCRA.

        Furthermore, when Congress incorporated RCRA’s definition of “solid waste” in CAA § 129 in 1990,
Congress was well aware that the DSE was encompassed in the definition of “solid waste” and that CAA § 129
would not apply to sewage sludge. This statutory exemption for sewage sludge – the subject of broad consensus
and reliance in the regulated community – can not be abrogated by subsequent rule making or preamble
statements. Moreover, the 1987 CWA amendments and the subsequent Part 503 rules established a
management program for sewage sludge dependent on its exclusion from RCRA regulation.
