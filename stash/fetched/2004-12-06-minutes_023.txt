Council Member Kleinberg asked whether each finding would have to be
reviewed.

Mr. Baum said each finding would not have to be reviewed. There had been
only one finding presented.

Council Member Kleinberg said there could be others that were unknown.
The maker of the motion said there only had to be a problem with one
finding.

Mr. Baum said the maker of the motion had not stated that. He suggested
to choose the one finding and fix the issue. If there were other issues, they
were at her discretion to fix them.

Council Member Kleinberg said she did not disagree with the motion, but
would like to propose that the Council approve a less dense project that met
some of the policy requirements to make the findings to approve the
Tentative Map.

Mayor Beecham asked whether a four-parcel map could be approved at that
time.

Mr. Baum said he felt the Council had the ability to adjust the count of the
lots, approve it that evening, and still make the findings.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION: Council Member Kleinberg moved that Council not
approve the tentative map as submitted, but make findings to approve a
tentative map of four parcels and consistent with staffâ€™s recommendations
originally and require soil with remediation, as necessary.

Mr. Baum said it would need to be approved with four parcels and indicate
any design changes necessary to meet the findings.

Council Member Kleinberg said she did not have the dimensions of the cul-
de-sac. She requested dimensions prior to development, and concurred any
residual toxic soil be removed.

Mr. Baum reiterated there should be appropriate remediation following soil
samples.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION FAILED FOR LACK OF A SECOND
