Martha Kanter, Chancellor of Foothill-DeAnza Community College District,

1) transfer students to the universities of their choice; 2) train and retain
thousands of students for jobs; 3) provide opportunity and educational
excellence in order for students to achieve their hopes and dreams; and 4)
to have the support of the community members, including foundation board
members. She asked the communities for their continued support and
leadership on behalf of the students they represented.
