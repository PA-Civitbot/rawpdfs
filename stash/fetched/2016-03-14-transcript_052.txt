the processing fees, where's the marketing, where's all that stuff that was in
the other budget?

Ms. Silvani: The budget that we were showing you on the slide is the budget
to administer the pilot programs for this year.

Vice Mayor Scharff: Do you have that slide? Can we just bring it up?

Ms. Silvani: We can backup, I think.

Vice Mayor Scharff: That's what I was looking at here.        In the packet,
where's the Executive Director's salary?

Mr. Mello: If I could jump in. If you look in the packet, there's a line item
for $54,000 for the low-income transit pass program. I think this slide
supplants that row in the table that's in the Staff Report.

Vice Mayor Scharff: Wait, wait. Say that again.

Mr. Mello: This slide only identifies the expenditures for the pilot program.
The other costs are still there.

Vice Mayor Scharff: How do these two budgets go together? Is the total
budget $182,000 or is it $182,000 plus ... I mean, the $54,000 obviously
goes to $85,000, I assume.

Ms. Silvani: Yes, the $54,000 goes to $85,000.

Vice Mayor Scharff: The $54,000 goes to $85,000, but there are all these
other things. How do I reconcile these two? One does not have an
Executive Director's salary. Where is that?

Mr. Mello: The $54,000 that's shown in the Staff Report, that actually goes
up to $128,000.

Vice Mayor Scharff: The difference is that $54,000 is now $128,000, and
that's all in that. That's the explanation (crosstalk)

Mr. Mello: There's more extensive pilots proposed on this slide than there
were in the Staff Report.

Vice Mayor Scharff: I was a little confused. The projected revenues are the
business contributions pledged. That's separate from the $10,000 from the
big Board Members, and then there's $5,000 from the little Board Members
and $1,000 from Philz. Right? That was the way it was structured?
