Mayor Mossar said the substitute motion was to rescind the Ordinance.

Council Member Freeman said she wanted to amend the motion to continue
discussion until after review of staff’s SOFA 2 CAP decision, which had been
directed to return prior to August 2003.

Mayor Mossar asked if it was an amendment to a motion to rescind the
Ordinance.

Mr. Calonne said it was inconsistent with the substitute motion.

Council Member Freeman said it was to continue the substitute motion to a
later date until after the Council had done what they had agreed to do.

Mayor Mossar felt it was a new motion.

Mr. Calonne said it was in order if the motion was to continue consideration
of the repeal to August.

The motion that he was speaking to was to proceed with the former decision
to complete the SOFA 2 CAP, which was inconsistent with the substitute
motion to repeal.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION FAILED 3-6, Freeman, Kishimoto, Lytle “yes”.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION: Council Member Freeman moved, seconded by
Lytle, to continue the discussion of the item until after review of staff’s
recommendation of the SOFA 2 CAP, which Council had already directed to
return prior to August 2003.

Council Member Freeman said her motion also included that Council would
follow the motion to review SOFA 2 CAP.

Mayor Mossar said she understood that a motion could be made to continue
the discussion with nothing else associated with it.

Mr. Calonne said there was nothing to undo. The affect of the continuance
was to leave it in place.

Council Member Freeman said before spending $40,000 on a referendum she
suggested that Council make a decision on what to do with SOFA 2.

Council Member Lytle felt it was a far better outcome to have a discussion
after Council had a chance to have staff follow up on the adopted action to
bring the SOFA 2 CAP back to Council.
