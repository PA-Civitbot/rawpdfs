                              MINUTES

Ms. Sullivan answered yes, as long as they lived within the specified
boundaries. Residents of the commercial core and South of Forest Avenue
(SOFA) areas would be eligible to purchase permits.

Vice Mayor Kniss inquired about the reasons for limiting enforcement to 8:00
A.M. to 5:00 P.M. Monday through Friday. Employees would be at work
after 5:00 P.M. and on weekends.

Ms. Sullivan advised that a majority of survey respondents wanted those
hours.

Vice Mayor Kniss asked if residents did not complain about parking on
weekends.

Ms. Sullivan responded yes.

Vice Mayor Kniss inquired whether respondents felt 5:00 P.M. was
sufficiently late in the evening for enforcement.

Ms. Sullivan answered yes.

Vice Mayor Kniss supported deleting the transferability aspect from the
Motion. Annexation would be an issue in the future. The first problem
would be residents wanting more guest permits than was allowed. She
asked how Staff would respond to requests for additional guest permits.

Ms. Sullivan would design guest permits to be transferable within a
household. A household could purchase up to two guest permits and up to
50 visitor passes.

Vice Mayor Kniss remarked that Staff was aware that those types of
problems were likely to arise.

Ms. Sullivan indicated the stakeholder group discussed selling unlimited
permits; however, eight or nine cars associated with one residential address
were part of the issue.
