Council Member Cordell asked if the Council approved this in January, if it
would give them enough time to get the project done by December 2008.

Mr. Wetzel stated that construction could not be done during the wet
weather season and would not begin until October 2008.

Council Member Cordell asked why the work could not be done during the
spring and the summer.

Mr. Wetzel replied the facility was supplying water to the fresh water marsh,
the Palo Alto Golf Course and Greer Park and the work needed to be done
during the wet weather months when there was not such a demand for
irrigation water.

Council Member Cordell asked what months the project needed to be worked
on.

Mr. Wetzel stated from October 2008 to May 2009.

Council Member Drekmeier asked if the Motion failed where they would
stand.

City Manager Frank Benest stated staff would present it at the next Council
meeting with the nine Council Members in attendance.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION: Council Member Drekmeier moved that Anderson
Pacific provide documentation that they pay prevailing wage.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION FAILED FOR LACK OF A SECOND.

Council Member Drekmeier stated prevailing wage helped more people
afford to live and work in Palo Alto, and the community had a lot to gain by
requiring prevailing wage.

Council Member Mossar stated if the contract was not approved, the City
would have to wait another year. She asked whether delaying the project
another year would put grant funds in jeopardy.

Mr. Sartor said it would and if the project went out to re-bid, the renovation
work would not start until next October.

Council Member Mossar stated it would jeopardize the funding from the
State to build a recycled water project and that the Council should schedule
a separate discussion regarding prevailing wage.
