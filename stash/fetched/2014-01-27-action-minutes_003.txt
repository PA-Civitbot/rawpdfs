ACTION ITEMS

14.   Council Review and Policy Direction to Staff on the Residential Parking
      Permit Program Framework (Continued from December 16, 2013).


MOTION: Council Member Klein moved, seconded by Council Member Burt
to: 1) direct Staff to draft an ordinance that provides a process and criteria
for establishment of individual Residential Parking Program (RPP) districts
based on input received this evening & disseminate the draft ordinance for
public review/comment prior to review by the Planning & Transportation
Commission, 2) direct Staff to concurrently convene a stakeholder group of
residents, businesses, and landowners/landlords to develop a draft
implementation strategy and timeline for the first RPP district, 3) urge Staff
to simplify the process outlined for neighborhoods starting from scratch to
enact a trial process so it is no more than one year from the time start of
the process, 4) Staff is to return with timetable by March 3, 2014, for
various activities such as stakeholder group, Planning and Transportation
Commission and the modified draft ordinance, so that we can have a trial
period begin by the first business day in January 2015.         Staff is to work
back from that date so Council can take action around November 15, 2014,
5) Staff to consider issuing an RFP to private landowners for potential leases
of parking spaces on their properties, 6) Staff to be flexible in determination
of neighborhood, meeting threshold when working through the
implementation phase, and 7) Staff is not to feel constrained with ensuring
the program is cost neutral.
