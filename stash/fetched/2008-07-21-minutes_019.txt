Vice Mayor Drekmeier asked if they could hear from Mr. Hayes representing
CEAP.

Mr. Hays stated he was not sure if they had the qualifications to do the job,
that they would depend on staff input, and would make their best efforts.

Council Member Burt stated it sounded as if CEAP was not set up to address
the situation and supported bypassing the CEAP route.

Council Member Barton stated he would be voting no on this Motion,
especially considering the CEAP’s concerns over their qualifications to
proceed.

Council Member Morton stated this was not an ideal situation for the CEAP
but staff had nothing to lose in engaging them.

Vice Mayor Drekmeier stated he would vote no, as there was limited time
with a volunteer group, and attention would be taken off the main focus.

Mr. Benest stated they would be coming back immediately after Council’s
vacation, with the initial cost benefit analysis, and staff could make
suggestions on large policy issues.

Council Member Kishimoto stated concern over the schedule and timeline.
She suggested a more comprehensive discussion with the new City Manager
on a full-time environmental coordinator. She suggested withdrawing the
Motion regarding CEAP.

Mr. Benest stated the new City Manager starts at the beginning of
September, and he proposed returning at that time with short-term plans
and budget discussion.

Council Member Kishimoto stated this was also her goal.

Council Member Morton stated he accepted this modification.

Mr. Benest stated it would be scheduled for October if Council desired.

Motion withdrawn by Council Member Kishimoto.
