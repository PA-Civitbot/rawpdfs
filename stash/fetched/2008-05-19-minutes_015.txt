address the issue of civic engagement. He stated that he has seen other
egovernment services that were preferable, so he would rather have Staff
research the subject and bring back alternatives. He stated that he would

emails received on this subject. He stated that as a member of the Policy
and Services Committee, he will be interested in reviewing this and will
support the Motion.

opinion that now is not the time to undertake this program.

vote for the Motion to refer this to Committee. He stated that possibly filling

be $10,000 and that should be available in the budget. He stated his view
that this would be an experimental solution that would further the Civic
Engagement goal. He stated his interest in providing an alternative to the
negativity appearing on Palo Alto Online and believes this is an approach
worth investigating. He stated that he would be open to other approaches
or services as this is investigated but sees this as a good first step.

take time, money, and effort. He stated his view that this is not the best

preferences. He further stated that is not truly civic engagement.
