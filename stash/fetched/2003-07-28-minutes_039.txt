Vice Mayor Beecham said if it was decided that a mistake was made
then getting the housing would be delayed over the next couple of
years. The market would tell if the right decision was made.

Council Member Ojakian said the area had been downzoned to a 1.1
FAR several years prior. It would need five votes to pass, otherwise
they were back to a 1.1 FAR.

Council Member Burch said the P&TC recommended the Council try
their proposal.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION WITHDRAWN BY MAKER AND SECONDER

SUBSTITUTE MOTION RESTATED: Council Member Kishimoto
moved, seconded by Freeman, to accept the staff recommendation in
Item a but to amend Item b for the base floor area, to limit the Floor
Area Ratio (FAR) be increased in RT-35 from 1.15 baseline up to 1.3
with the bonus and in RT-50 from 1.3 baseline up to 1.5 with the
bonus by providing one or more of the provisions.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION PASSED 6-1, Burch “no.”

Counsel Member Lytle suggested a CUP finding for historic buildings,
and that they meet the national standards for historic preservation as
one of the findings for achieving a bonus.

AMENDMENT: Council Member Lytle moved, seconded by Kleinberg,
to include in the Conditional Use Permit (CUP) findings that any
historic structures meet the Secretary of State Standards for
Rehabilitation, to take advantage of the bonus floor area program.

Vice Mayor Beecham asked whether an historic building be rebuilt as
an historic building and reused or was it likely to be torn down.

Mr. Emslie said there were a number of historic buildings that were
over 1.1 FAR, and it was likely that if it was remodeled and expanded
slightly, they could fall within the FAR. The idea of being able to
maintain the basic form of the building with the opportunity to add the
appropriate number of apartments upstairs was compatible for the
property owners.

AMENDMENT PASSED 7-0, Morton, Mossar “not participating.”
