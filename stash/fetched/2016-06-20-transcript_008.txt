                          TRANSCRIPT
Stephanie Munoz: Good evening, Mayor Burt and Council. Thank you for
letting me speak. I want to express my gratitude and my admiration that
Palo Alto is considering retaining Buena Vista. I always thought it was
unworthy of Palo Alto to invite these poor, hardworking people to join Palo
Alto in holy municipality with the mental reservation that they could be
divorced once they had fulfilled their function of developing that little area.
I'm so pleased and so proud that you're planning to make it right. Thank
you. Bye.

Mayor Burt: Thank you. That includes our Oral Communications.
