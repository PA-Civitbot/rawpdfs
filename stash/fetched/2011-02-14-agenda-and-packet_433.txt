on one day. EPA does not know if these data are representative of normal operating conditions or whether the
metals content in the sludge was at the low end or the high end of a typical range. See Proposed Rule, 75 Fed.




                                                                                                                        Attachment: PA Comments EPA HQ-OAR-2009-0559_Final (1297 : EPA Proposed Rule on Sewage Sludge Incinerators)
Reg. at 63268 (requesting comment on whether the metals content in the sludge during the test was
representative of low or high points in the typical mercury range). This range can vary significantly with a ten-
fold difference between the minimum and maximum mercury values. See Attachment A of NEORSD
Comments on Proposed Rule. Thus, EPA may have miscalculated the mercury content of sewage sludge
because its data are not representative of typical mercury values.

        EPA also makes significant incorrect assumptions about operating hours and sewage sludge feed rates
that impact its mercury estimate. Rather than take the time to collect actual operating data through a formal
Information Collection Request (“ICR”), EPA assumes that each incinerator operates at 75 percent of its rated
capacity. POTWs and their incinerators are designed to accommodate significant wet weather events that can
significantly increase the flow to the headworks of the POTW with minimal notice. As such, the typical
operating conditions for the POTW and its incinerators are significantly below the design capacity. See Table 2.

These examples indicate that EPA has overstated the amount of dry tons of sludge incinerated per year by a
factor of two or more. Hours of operation are also overstated in EPA’s analysis but by a lesser amount. EPA
must take the time needed to collect the feed rate and operating hours data from all SSIs before it uses this
information to calculate the baseline mercury emissions from SSIs. An accurate assessment of baseline
mercury content is critical to a proper beyond the floor analysis of the cost effectiveness of additional mercury
controls.

        The anecdotal information available to NACWA indicates that EPA’s calculation significantly
overestimates mercury emissions. NEORSD compared EPA’s mercury estimate for two of its facilities with its
own calculation based on the actual sludge samples taken in 2009 to demonstrate compliance with Part 503
requirements. The NEORSD calculation reveals that EPA’s mercury estimate for its Southerly and Westerly
plants combined was nearly three times higher than the actual concentration of mercury in the sludge in 2009
based on the Part 503 sampling. Wayne County, New Jersey performed a similar analysis using stack test data
