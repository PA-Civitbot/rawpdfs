City Manager Benest said it was proper for the Council to say
they had a value preference that the City's executive employees
should live in Palo Alto. However, the Council needed to
recognize the financial decision that preference would carry.

MOTION RESTATED: Council Member Freeman, seconded by Lytle to
refer Item 20B back to Finance Committee with direction to
review the Management Benefit Program section and the Direct
City Loan section.

Council Member Morton said the motion was an                unnecessary
intrusion into difficult decisions for City staff.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION: Council Member Morton, seconded by Burch to
adopt the staff recommendation for the resolution as noted in
the agenda.

Council Member Burch agreed with the comments made by Council
Member Morton. He would be interested in a report from staff as
to the total cost in the past year of reimbursing job-related
computer equipment and software.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION FAILED       3-4,   Burch,   Morton,   Mossar    “yes,”
Kleinberg, Ojakian absent.

RESTATED   MOTION   PASSED   6-1,   Morton   “no”,   Kleinberg,   Ojakian
absent.

COUNCIL COMMENTS, QUESTIONS, AND ANNOUNCEMENTS

Council Member Lytle noted the City of Menlo Park would have a
decision regarding the road widening and pathways C-1 proposal
on November 12, 2002. Council was on record objecting to the
trail alignment. The County asked Stanford to do an EIR for the
alternative to the proposed trail alignment. City Attorney Ariel
Calonne was looking into preparing a letter to send to Menlo
Park and wondered whether the Council should agendize the issue
for discussion.

City Attorney Ariel Calonne noted he would be meeting with the
City Attorney in Menlo Park the next week.

City Manager Frank Benest noted a special Council meeting would
have to be scheduled.

Mr. Calonne suggested he report to the Council by the end of the
next week.
