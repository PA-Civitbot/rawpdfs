Diana Steeples, 850 Webster Street #935, said it was an opportunity to
increase housing for lower income individuals and an area, which needed
increased residential.

D.J. Joseph, Boyce Avenue said there was a need for more playing fields.

Edie Keating, 3553 Alma Street, said Stanford offered to pay the
development of the site. She suggested to the staff or Council to take the
current commercial areas that would be turned into housing, and zone them
as housing.

Joe Martignetti, 1018 Cowper Street stated there was not enough field space
in Palo Alto. He also suggested approval of the housing.

Noah Sneider, 403 Cowper Street, said there had been progress on the
project and hoped there would be continued progress.

Viviana Tul, 410 Sheridan Avenue, said she was enthusiastic about more
fields but stated it did not seem like the appropriate place for a field.

Council Member Ojakian asked if Stanford leased their lands for greater than
51 years.

Mr. Benest responded that although 51 years was the most that Stanford
would lease their land for $1/year, it would be renewable.

Council Member Ojakian asked if the City leased their property for longer
than 51 years.

Mr. Benest stated the City leased property for 50 years.

Council Member Ojakian said Stanford and the City of Palo Alto had the
same terms.

MOTION: Council Member Ojakian moved, seconded by Kishimoto, to
approve the staff recommendation to give direction to the City Manager and
City Attorney to negotiate a Development Agreement for the Mayfield site
based on Stanfordâ€™s offer letter dated June 10, 2003.

Council Member Ojakian said Stanford was being a good community citizen.
The proposal honored a series of Council policies. The City would again have
use of property it had previously.
