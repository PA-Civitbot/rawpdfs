                              Office of the City Council
                                MEMORANDUM



TO:           City Council

FROM:         Mayor Burch and Council Member Freeman

DATE:         February 3, 2005

SUBJECT:      POLICE REVIEW BODY

With the goal of accountability for the Police Department through openness (within the laws of
confidentiality) and increased public scrutiny and reporting, we recommend the Council consider
creating a review body for police-related issues from the community. We recommend this review
body be the Human Relations Commission. In addition to hearing concerns from members of the
community, who may have issues with the police, and sharing and getting feedback on new Police
Department policies that affect community relations, the review group would be responsible for
reporting its findings to the Council and the public on a periodic basis.

We ask the Council to support us in asking the City Manager to agendize discussion of the
responsibilities of this review body as soon as possible, after providing the Human Relations
Commission with an opportunity for its review and input.
