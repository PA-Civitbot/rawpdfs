Mayor Burt stated he enjoyed working with his colleagues, Staff, and the
community. The year commenced with major challenges which were taken
on by the City Council and Staff.             The year ended with strong
accomplishments, and goals set were largely achieved. Over the last two
years, with a reduction of 60 Staff positions, the City had become leaner and
more efficient. A challenge for the City Council, moving forward, was to
work closely with Staff to generate reasonable goals for the coming year.
He spoke on the participation and commitment from community members in
achieving accomplishments this year.
