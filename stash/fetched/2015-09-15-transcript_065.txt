the summer of 1977, has had the pleasure of leading every successful
transportation funding measure for specific improvements in the history of
Santa Clara County. That started in 1984 with what was called Measure A,
that built Highway 85, improved 237 and greatly improved Highway 101.
Second—would you like me to wait, sir?

Council Member DuBois: I'm sorry. Go ahead.

Mr. Guardino: Second, the 1996 Measures A and B, that was a nine-year
measure that funded 18 road and transit improvements on time and on
budget, followed by a 2000 measure that didn't go into effect until 2006 that
will run until 2036. In 2008, an 1/8 cent sales tax measure that didn't start
until 2011 or 2012—fuzzy on the date this late at night—and will run for 30
years until 2041 or 2042. All told, those measures will generate about 11
billion in local sales tax revenue, drawing in about 3-4 billion in other
regional, State and Federal funds because of that match. With that, let's see
how well the mouse works. We'll move forward. First, context. As you
know, the Valley Transportation Authority issued months ago a call for
projects of all 15 cities and towns, the County and regional agencies like
Caltrain and other regional transit providers, so that they could determine
for their purposes what the Metropolitan Transportation Commission as well
as a potential transportation funding measure in this county, what those
wants and needs might be. The call for projects generated a list, 630
projects long totaling $50.5 billion in improvements just in Santa Clara
County alone. I suspect there's probably a few double counting of projects,
but in conversations with VTA staff it'll probably still exceed $45 billion in
wants or needs. To put that into perspective. Current estimates, if we were
to pursue and be successful with a 1/2 cent 30-year funding measure, that
would bring in, in today's dollars—today we're generating with a 1/2 cent
about $198 million a year in Santa Clara County—that would be roughly 6
billion minus 60 million over 30 years. 6 billion for 50.5 billion in stated
wants and needs. The City of Palo Alto was actually pretty limited in what
you looked for. Twenty-three projects in that call for projects, totaling under
$1 billion or about $909 million. I returned earlier this evening from Gilroy
on the precise other end of the county. Their request list was $1.9 billion in
projects. They have twice the need or twice the appetite or twice the
imagination that you do. I'm sure they're compelling projects as well. There
are about 1.9 million citizens in our county or residents in our county. Palo
Alto has about 67,000 of those, about 3 1/2 percent of the population. I
want to thank Ed Shikada from saving me from making a mistake on the
next foil. We may have been counting all sales tax generated rather than
the 1/2 cent that we're looking for, for apples to apples comparison. He
mentioned 2012, not 2014, numbers that Palo Alto generates in all sales tax,
about 16.2 million in 2012. If we take that 198 million that a 1/2 cent alone
                                                                        Page 65 of 101
