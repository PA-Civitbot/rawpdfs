Council Member Shepherd asked if the two-pole concept would have allowed
AT&T to use one pole and another carrier to use the second.

Ms. French stated she was correct. She explained the equipment located
below the two antennas was designed to handle more than one carrier. She
further explained that in a scenario with only one antenna, if another carrier
wished to co-locate on the pole after AT&T, then another antenna would
need to be added.

Council Member Shepherd asked if that scenario would require use of the
goal-post shaped antenna if Council approved it.

Ms. French indicated there would have to be another application.

Council Member Shepherd inquired if another carrier would be required to go
through the same process if it wanted to install DAS units on other poles.

Ms. French indicated the new carrier would follow the same process.

Council Member Shepherd asked whether another carrier would pay the City
or AT&T for use of a cell tower.

Mr. Williams stated AT&T would derive some funds from that, but the City
would receive funds from a license agreement with the other carrier.

Council Member Shepherd asked if the noise from the equipment was
equivalent to the noise she heard from the green utility boxes in her
neighborhood.

Ms. French reported the dBa mentioned in the noise report was between a
refrigerator humming and conversation.

Council Member Shepherd wanted to know if the two noises were similar.

Mr. Williams asked if Council Member Shepherd would like the consultant to
answer her question.

Dieter Preiser, RCC Consultants, stated RCC had performed a peer review of
the noise study limited to the computational aspects in relation to the
municipal ordinance. He did not know the noise she was referring to and
could not provide a comparison.
