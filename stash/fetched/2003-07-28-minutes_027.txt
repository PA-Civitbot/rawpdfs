AMENDMENT WITHDRAWN BY MAKER AND SECONDER

AMENDMENT: Council Member Burch moved, seconded by Lytle, to
replace Item g relating to newly constructed and remodeled ground
floor building facades, with the provision that the (P) Combining
District shall apply throughout SOFA 2.

Council Member Kleinberg said new ground commercial space that was
on street level should have design flexibility.

Vice Mayor Beecham made a suggestion to design building facades to
be “street friendly”.

Council Member Lytle said she wanted to encourage auto services in
the area.

Ms. Grote suggested recommending the existing “P” combining district
regulations be retained because they referred to physical
improvements.

AMENDMENT PASSED 6-1, Kishimoto “no”, Morton, Mossar “not
participating.”
