COUNCIL MATTERS

12.   Approval of a City Auditor Employment Agreement with Lynda Flores
      Brouchoud.

Council Member Barton specified this as an employment agreement
consistent with the approved term sheet discussed prior to Council’s break,
that it contained the contract changes of July 2008.

MOTION:      Council Member Barton moved, seconded by Mayor Klein to
approve the City Auditor Employment Agreement with Council Appointed
Officer (CAO) Lynda Flores Brouchoud.

Vice Mayor Drekmeier thanked Council Member Barton for his efforts on this
recruitment.

Council Member Kishimoto asked if the wording of car allowances could be
changed to transportation allowances.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER change Clause 5.2 to read “Auditor shall receive a
City transportation allowance as allowed in the Management and Professional
Personnel and Council Appointees Compensation Plan because her duties
require exclusive and unrestricted use of an automobile. The Auditor may
also use the transportation expense allowance for alternate means of
transportation necessary and useful for the exercise of her duties”.

Mayor Klein asked whether the same language could be used as in the City
Manager’s agreement.

City Attorney Gary Baum stated the City Manager’s agreement included
multiple and specific clauses.

Mayor Klein suggested      using   just   the   one   sentence   referring   to
transportation.
