The 15-year fixed price of $62.95/MWh is about $3-5/MWh below the current forward price for
base load electricity for the next four years, meaning that there could be a fairly modest short-
term rate reduction of approximately -0.02¢/kWh. Electricity prices more than ten years in the
future range from $65-75/MWh: at a market price of $70/MWh, long-term rates would be lower
by approximately 0.05¢/kWh relative to buying the same quantity of energy from the electric
market. The levelized long-term rate impact is minor, approximately 0.01 ¢/kWh favorable,
based on a first year market price of $60/MWh and increasing at 2.0% per year. The contract
facilitates meeting the Renewable Energy Supply Implementation Plan goals with a rate impact
well below the ½¢/kWh limit recommended by the Finance Committee and approved by
Council.

POLICY IMPLICATIONS
Investor-owned utilities have a legislated goal, referred to as the “RPS” for “Renewable Portfolio
Standard”, of achieving 10% renewables by 2010 and 20% renewables by 2017, with “outs” if
the cost is too high. The California Energy Commission and California Public Utilities
Commission have adopted a more aggressive goal of 20% by 2010 and 33% by 2020, and the
state legislature has made several attempts to adopt these same goals and make them apply to
municipal utilities as well as investor-owned utilities. Although large hydroelectric generation is
a renewable resource, it is not considered “eligible renewable” Approval of this agreement will
accelerate achieving the renewable investment targets from 20% in 2015 closer to 2010, by
bringing the projected total long-term renewable energy supply content to 14-20% by 2007 with
an estimated retail rate impact between –0.1 and +0.2 ¢/kWh.

The proposed contract is a key element of the Utilities Renewable Energy Supply
Implementation Plan (CMR:168:04), and supports the Council-approved Utilities Strategic Plan
(CMR:432:02 and CMR:148:05) and the Utilities Strategic Implementation Plan (CMR:223:01).

Renewable energy supplies are required to meet the targets established by Council in LEAP
Guideline #6 (Renewable Portfolio Investments) and also support LEAP Guideline #2 (Hydro
Risk Management) and #3 (Market Risk Management) by diversifying Palo Alto’s resources and
reduced dependence on supplies from the electricity market. Approval of this agreement will
accelerate achieving the renewable investment targets from 2015 closer to 2010.

   •   LEAP Guideline #6: Renewable Portfolio Investments: The City shall continue to offer a
       renewable resource-based retail rate for all customers who want to voluntarily select an
       increased content of renewable energy. In addition to the voluntary program, the City
       shall invest in new renewable resources to meet the City’s sustainability goals while
       ensuring that the retail rate impact does not exceed 0.5¢/kWh on average. Pursue a target
       level of new renewable purchases of 10% of the expected portfolio load by 2008 and
       move to a 20% target by 2015, contingent on economic viability. The contracts for
       investment in renewable resources are not to exceed 30 years in term.
