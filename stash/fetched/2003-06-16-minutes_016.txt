     budget reduction of $3,200 for council meeting meals, $1,300 for the
     Reorganization meeting and $2,600 for State of the City meeting.
     Total additional reduction is $7,100.

     The Finance Committee recommends the City Council direct staff to
     reinstate Community Service Department (CSD) programs that are
     expected to be cost neutral and that balance revenue against direct
     and marginal costs. As a result of this motion, the 2003-05 CSD
     budget has been amended as follows:

     1. Children’s Theatre
           o Increase 0.67 hourly FTE for Children’s Theatre in 2003-05:
              $25,182
           o Increase revenue to offset additional expense in Children’s
              Theatre in 2003-05: $25,182
     2. Adult Arts Programs
           o Reinstate adult arts program expense in 2004-05: $19,720
           o Reinstate adult arts program revenue in 2004-05: $32,900
     3. Art Center
           o Reinstate 0.07 hourly FTE to retain Art Center hours in 2003-
              05: $2,631
           o Reinstate revenue associated with retaining Art Center hours
              in 2003-05: $8,820

              05: $40,000
           o Reinstate revenue associated with recreation instructors in
              2004-05: $50,000
     5. Cubberley Community Center
           o Increase 2.00 hourly FTE to perform setups for increased
              room rentals at Cubberley: $75,171 in 2003-04
           o Increase revenue associated with additional Cubberley
              expense in 2003-04: $90,000

     The Finance Committee recommends the City Council direct staff to
     hire the Director of Libraries position by no later than December 2003.
     As a result of this motion, the CSD budget will be increased by
     $88,500 in 2003-04 and $177,000 in 2004-05.

     The Finance Committee recommends the City Council direct staff of
     the Human Services Division of CSD to decrease reliance on paper-
     based kiosks and increase web presence to secure cost savings. This
     motion does not result in a change to the CSD budget in 2003-05.
