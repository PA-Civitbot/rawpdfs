Council Member Barton stated the less expensive option was Option Two
(New Mitchell Park Library).

Council Member Drekmeier clarified the reason Option One (Addition to
existing Mitchell Park Library) was withdrawn was because it was the least
attractive and the second most expensive option.

MOTION: Council Member Klein moved, seconded by Morton, to reject the
staff recommendation to begin polling and select Option 3b for the Mitchell
Park Library/Community Center expansion.

Council Member Morton stated the community would support an election for
a single project.

Council Member Cordell stated the election would not be a single project. It
would be for a Public Safety Building and upgrading the Libraries.

Assistant City Manager Emily Harrison stated she met with the polling firm
and shared the project background. The firm recommended preliminary
polling to assess general public attitude towards local government.

Council Member Cordell stated if there had there been a focus group in lieu
of a poll, it would have been less costly and more effective.

Ms. Harrison stated the option of a focus group had not been broached. A
Request for Proposal (RFP) would be sent out and the option of a focus
group could be added.

Council Member Mossar stated the previous polls were viewed by the public
as being biased.

Ms. Harrison stated the polling firm suggested the poll questions and
responses be generated to the newspapers to be viewed by the public once
the polls were closed. The firm also recommended a sub-committee to the
Council to advise the staff on the poll questions.

Council Member Mossar asked Mr. Baum at what point did polling become
advocacy.

Mr. Baum stated the City did not permit any form of advocacy; pollers
gathered information but could not tell people how to vote.

Council Member Klein was concerned that polling caused more confusion to
the issue.
