Mr. Baum stated the language refers to 15,000 square feet, which may
include sub-tenants compatible with grocery stores, including services to be
approved through site and design review.

Council Member Morton stated the wording needed to specify the minimum
size for a grocery store.

Vice Mayor Klein stated his support for the language.

AMENDMENT FAILED         4-4 Kleinberg, Klein, Kishimoto, Cordell no, Mossar
absent.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER that the 15,000 square foot grocery store may
include sub-tenants compatible with grocery stores including services to be
approved through site and design.

Mr. McNellis stated a 12,000 square foot market was an acceptable request.

Council Member Kleinberg asked why the usable square footage was 11,500
of the total 12,000 square foot store.

Mr. McNellis stated the basement was added space.        When the square
footage was set it was a total amount of usable area.

Pat Constance, Green Briar Homes, confirmed the removal of the occupancy
language and the 180-day clause.

Mr. Baum said the developer could pull the building permit only when there
was a signed one-year lease.

Mr. McNellis stated the necessary timeline for construction to secure a
tenant lease was approximately fourteen months and the lease was usually
tied to the completion of the building.

Mr. Baum commented the Council had discretion to determine the timeline
and he suggested going out further than one year.

Mayor Kishimoto asked whether the changed language would return with the
2nd reading of the Ordinance.

Vice Mayor Klein stated concern that a lessee would terminate the lease
prior to the completion of the building.

Council Member Beecham suggested a two-year period built into the lease.
