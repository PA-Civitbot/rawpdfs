needed to be reevaluated since funding was not a sure thing. The Council
was urged to support alternative 1, which was to not proceed with the
project and reject the bids.

Mayor Mossar said she worked on the project for approximately ten years.
The Council agreed to pursue the project and made requirements that
developments including the PAMF and Westin Hotel contribute money for the
project. The VTA stood behind the Councilâ€™s repeated decision to move
forward with the project. Transportation funding came from sources that
were for transportation. When a prior Council approved the project that
moved the PAMF to the El Camino Real site, a promise was made to the
Downtown merchants that the tunnel would be built.
