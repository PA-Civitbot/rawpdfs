Mayor Scharff: Now, we move on to our Item Number 10, a public hearing

Clare Campbell, Senior Planner: Thank you, good evening. Clare Campbell,
Senior Planner. As a quick reminder, you were provided with an at-places
memo for this discussion tonight. That memo highlights some text changes
that we're proposing for the draft ordinance and also included an attachment
for the housing inventory sites discussion that we're going to have later.

proposed amendments are focused on implementing the City's Housing
