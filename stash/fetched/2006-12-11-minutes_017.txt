MOTION: Vice Mayor Kishimoto moved, seconded by Beecham, to direct
the City Manager and the City Attorney to initiate appropriate negotiations
with Los Altos for the Los Altos Treatment Plant site for the auto dealer
usage and negotiate with Anderson Honda.

Mayor Kleinberg asked Mr. Baum whether the motion was to develop a lease
with the City as partial owners of the treatment plant.

Mr. Baum stated the City did not have control of the treatment plant site.

Mayor Kleinberg requested the motion language be changed.

Vice Mayor Kishimoto stated the dealership was important to the City. She
indicated her choice would be the treatment plant which complied with the
de-urbanization of the Baylands.

Council Member Beecham asked what the options were in gaining control
over the treatment plant.

Mr. Baum stated Los Altos had gone into closed session on the issue and it
was likely the matter would not be resolved for a few years.

Council Member Beecham asked Mr. Andersen what impact that timeframe
would have on his decision to stay in Palo Alto.

Ralph Britton, Palo Alto Airport Association, 240 Rinconada Avenue, stated
he did not support the Airport location for the dealership.

Emily Renzel, 1056 Forest Avenue, stated she did not support the lease of
City property.

Herb Borock, P.O. Box 632, stated he supported the treatment plant location
for the dealership.

Council Member Drekmeier asked if there were other potential uses for the
site at Greer and Embarcadero competing against the resource recovery
center.

Mr. Benest stated it had been discussed that the Greer and Embarcadero
location would be used for some of the Cityâ€™s environmental services
locations.

Council Member Drekmeier stated the Los Altos Treatment Plant would be
the preferred location with a minimum effect on the Baylands.
