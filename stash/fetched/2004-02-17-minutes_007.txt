Council Member Mossar asked when the effectiveness of the TDM program
was calculated. She asked what employees were counted and whether off-
site employees were included.

Mr. Jury said off-site employees were not included.

Council Member Mossar asked how many employees were moved off-site to
the West Bayshore site.

Mr. Jury said he believed there were approximately 100 employees at that
site.

Council Member Mossar said she had concerns for those employees as they
did not have transit.

Mr. Jury said employees were offered carpools, bicycle lockers, and
assistance with transit passes.

Council Member Kishimoto asked whether the row of trees to be planted at
PAMF would screen the building from Homer Avenue.

Managing Arborist Dave Docktor said provision for landscaping had been
made on the eastern side of Building D. He confirmed there were tall trees
planned, which would be visible from Homer Avenue.

Council Member Kishimoto said the parking structure would also be visible.

Mr. Docktor said the parking structure had a row of existing Coast Redwood
trees, which would obscure the parking structure in the future. The trees
would not completely screen the building, as there was limited room
between Building D and the Homer Avenue undercrossing circle.

Council Member Kishimoto asked whether a greater setback would be
needed for more trees or would the current setback accommodate larger
trees.

Mr. Docktor said he believed there was enough room for more trees in the
landscaped area.

Council Member Mossar said the approved project opened up a view
corridor.

Ms. Grote said there was a row of trees included in the Homer Tunnel Project
along Alma Street.

Council Member Morton stated he would deny the appeal.

MOTION: Council Member Kishimoto moved, seconded by Freeman, to
direct staff to include a condition to require more effective vegetative
screenings.
