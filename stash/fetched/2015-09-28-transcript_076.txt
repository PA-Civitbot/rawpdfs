Council Member DuBois: Again, I think it's mostly captured in here. If you
want to add those specific words, I would be open.

Council Member Kniss: What I would do that is with City ownership with
fiber assets as a public benefit. If you're comfortable with that?

Council Member DuBois: That's fine.

Council Member Burt: That's fine with me as well.

Mayor Holman: Council Member Burt? As a public benefit, okay.

Council Member Kniss: Pat, that work for you or not?

Mayor Holman: Yes, it does. It does.

Council Member Burt: Yes (crosstalk) works too.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to add to the Motion Part A, “as a public benefit”
after “Fiber assets.”

Council Member Kniss: I think we're getting there. Let me mention again,
though. I'm concerned with who is actually going to do this. We're putting
out—this is a long and very prescriptive motion that we're putting together.
It's sort of breathtaking in some ways. I'm looking down at Jon. Are you
going to drive this train or is it going to be someone else?

Mr. Reichental:   It would fall under my jurisdiction, yeah, working with
Utilities.

Council Member Kniss: You will be the conductor, I'm hearing.

Mr. Reichental: I would be the conductor, yeah.

Council Member Kniss: Do you see this as realistic to get to by the end of
this year?

Mr. Reichental: Not by the end—no, this is significant work.
