make it infeasible while the higher the CO2 could make it look more feasible;
although, at the end of the day it costs more than what would be expected.

Mr. Bobel stated Staff was going to present a range of options that fit the
parameters requested for Council review.

Council Member Scharff asked how much would be spent for the Consultant
between now and June.

Mr. Bobel stated the additional cost would range from $15 to $20 thousand.

Council Member Klein asked whether Staff had obtained cost data on the
GreenWaste facility being built in the City of San Jose.

Mr. Bobel stated Staff had no additional data beyond what Staff previous
reported to Council. There was continued dialogue with GreenWaste,
although there was no new information on the lease arrangement with San
Jose.

Council Member Klein asked if the cost estimate to build the GreenWaste
facility in San Jose appeared low compared to having the facility built in Palo
Alto.

Mr. Bobel stated yes.

Council Member Klein asked how GreenWaste could build a facility in San
Jose for a lower figure than Staff had thought possible, and why the same
would not be true in Palo Alto.

Mr. Bobel stated the thought behind the variance in cost was the economy to
scale from building a much larger facility.

Council Member Klein asked whether the numbers justified the economies of
scale.

Mr. Bobel stated that was one of the issues being brought back to Council in
June.

Council Member Klein asked whether there would be a line item breaking out
the size variance with the economies of scale.

Mr. Bobel stated Staff, with the help of the Consultant, would make an effort
to explain the differences.

Council Member Klein stated it would be helpful if Staff was able to quantify
the size by the expense.
