City Manager Frank Benest said the meeting with the Firefighterâ€™s Union
regarding staffing Fire Station 8 without overtime had been scheduled for
July 13, 2007.

Fire Chief Nick Marinaro said determination of high fire days was by
temperature, wind speed, humidity, fuel temperature, and fuel moisture.
These measures were calculated by a computer system that determined the
burn index.

Director of Open Space Greg Betts advised there were fire breaks in the
parks throughout the City. Foothill Park had a roving fire patrol and the Park
Rangers were trained in wildland fires.

Council Member Morton asked whether the support from the County Fire
Department was automatic and what the response time was.

Chief Marinaro stated County Fire automatically sent resources with a 10
minutes response time.

Vice Mayor Klein asked how the fuel load was quantified and a description of
high fire days.

Chief Marinaro said the fuel load could be quantified by a fire behavioral
specialist and the higher the burn index the greater potential to spread.

Vice Mayor Klein asked for statistics on low vs. high fire days.

Chief Marinaro stated fires occur more frequently on high fire days.

Vice Mayor Klein asked whether staffing levels were discussed with the Fire
Union during negotiations.

Mr. Benest said the Union was clear on not discussing minimum staffing
levels.

Council Member Cordell asked which fire precautions had been in effect the
longest and which had been implemented solely for this season.

Mr. Betts stated the closures of Encinal and Pine Gulch Parks and the posting
at Foothill Park were unique this season.

Council Member Cordell asked for an explanation on the panoramic cameras.
