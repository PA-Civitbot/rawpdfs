Council Member Burch asked if the Service Employees International Union
(SEIU) members made a commitment to the number of voluntary hours.

Mr. Benest said a pledge card was signed by the SEIU members indicating
how many days and hours would be taken.

Council Member Burch asked if it would be difficult to do the same process
for the Managers and Professionals group.

Mr. Benest said the time spent to calculate the pay for the employees in
SEIU was extremely expensive.

Council Member Burch asked why time had to be spent to recalculate the
pay.

Mr. Benest said there were issues related to overtime. Different methods of
calculations had to be made. A three-day mandatory furlough would be very
simple.

Council Member Burch asked why the same process could not be done.

Mr. Benest said everyone’s salary had to be recalculated with the SEIU. A
process for the Managers had been put in place.

Council Member Morton asked whether the Management and Professional
group members would commit to and code three days. A check could be
made at the end of the year to see if everyone had taken three days.

Mr. Benest said that was considered a mandatory furlough.

Council Member Morton said a commitment of three days was being asked.

Mr. Benest said the budget was predicated on a mandatory savings of $1
million, and he needed to recommend a Management Compensation Plan.
Numerous budget hearings were held and a mandatory furlough was a key
element of the budget proposal.

Council Member Morton asked why a commitment similar to the SEIU’s could
not be asked of the Management and Professional group.

Mr. Benest said in numerous meetings with the Manager and Professional
group, the proposal was supported.

Council Member Ojakian said 274 employees with three days off per
employee gave 822 days. There should be a way to track the days in
Systems and Applications and Data Processing (SAP).
