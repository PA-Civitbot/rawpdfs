Council Member Morton asked whether staff had done any research on
whether bonds were more likely to pass on a June ballot as opposed to a
November ballot.

Ms. Harrison stated there had been discussions on that and had been told
that a November election with a maximum turn out would give the best
chance for a proposal which had to do with the demographics in Palo Alto.

Ms. Morariu stated there were two separate consultants one did the polling
and one had been working on the outreach messages. They both strongly
recommended against the June 2008 measure given the lack of time for
outreach.

Council Member Morton asked whether the outreach was more complicated
when they are focused on two items like the Library Community Center and
the Public Safety Building.

Ms. Harrison stated yes.

Council Member Morton clarified that outreach for one project would be
better than two.

Ms. Harrison asked us not to underestimate the impact of the Public Safety
Building coming through financing other than a General Obligation (GO)
Bond.

Vice Mayor Drekmeier stated the first action question was to confirm the
preferred option for the Library and community center projects. He asked
what the Council would be polling.

Ms. Morariu stated they would have to work with the polling consultant to
come up with different options.

Ms. Harrison stated the Council could direct staff to proceed with a package
of projects and staff could return at the second round of polling with
information. The decisions could be made later in the process with a
November election.

Vice Mayor Drekmeier asked whether the direction could be that the full
project was the preferred alternative unless polling showed it would not be
approved.

Ms. Harrison stated that was correct.
