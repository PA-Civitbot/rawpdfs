There are three purposes to the pre-Council planning meeting: 1) to plan how the
meeting will be conducted; 2) to identify any issues or questions that may need greater
staff preparation for the meeting; and 3) to discuss future meetings. The purpose of the
meeting is not to work on policy issues. Normally, only the Mayor and Vice Mayor are
expected to attend the pre-Council meetings with the City Manager and other CAOs.

ENFORCEMENT
Council Members have the primary responsibility to assure that these protocols are
understood and followed, so that the public can continue to have full confidence in the
integrity of government. As an expression of the standards of conduct expected by the
City for Council Members, the protocols are intended to be self-enforcing. They
therefore become most effective when members are thoroughly familiar with them and
embrace their provisions. For this reason, Council Members entering office shall sign a
statement affirming they have read and understood the Council protocols. In addition,
the protocols shall be annually reviewed by the Policy and Services Committee and
updated as necessary.
