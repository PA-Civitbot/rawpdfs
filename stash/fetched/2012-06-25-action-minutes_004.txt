amendments, to allow for the secondary use and leasing of electric utility
substation sites and City Hall to wireless communication service providers to
better meet the communityâ€™s need for such services. Council should
specifically direct staff to:

     1. Retain a wireless communications consultant/provider to further
        evaluate the technical and marketing feasibility of the utility sites, City
        Hall and any other sites deemed potentially feasible, including
        conceptual design for the towers and antennas;
     2. Initiate zoning ordinance amendments to address height and site
        development standards for such facilities, and to provide for
        expeditious review of such projects and subsequent collocations; and
     3. Explore and develop incentives for use of the facilities, including a
        ministerial permit review process, favorable lease rates, and
        streamlined utility and encroachment permit reviews, for consideration
        with the zoning ordinance amendments; and
     4. Return to Council in 6 months with specifics of proposal and related
        ordinances.
