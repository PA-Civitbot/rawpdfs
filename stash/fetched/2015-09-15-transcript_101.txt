Mayor Holman: Council Member Burt.

Council Member Burt: Without going into discussion, I would like to ask the
City Manager if we are too far along on the El Camino Park to in anyway
reconsider this. I understand that you would have irrigation issues. It's
very far along and not for a response right now, but is there still time to
reconsider?

Council Member Kniss: I would certainly amen to that.

Mayor Holman: Comment, no response, same thing with Mayfield. Council
Member Filseth.

Council Member Filseth: That was actually what I was about to ask. Those
Mayfield soccer fields at the corner opposite the VTA lot are artificial turf and
have been for a couple of years. Are we seeing negative impacts from
them? There's kids playing out there all the time.

Mayor Holman: It's scheduled to be replaced as more artificial turf.

Council Member Filseth: With more artificial turf.

Mayor Holman: Any otherâ€”I see no other lights, so meeting is adjourned.
Thank you all so very much.

Adjournment: The meeting was adjourned at 11:28 P.M.
