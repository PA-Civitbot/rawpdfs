Council Member Schmid noted the scale of the bond measure would be $80-
$90 million. The Public Safety Building would comprise 60 percent of the
measure, with the remainder divided between parks, bikes, the Post Office,
and Animal Services.

Council Member Shepherd indicated property values within Palo Alto were
increasing, yet it was difficult for the City to capture that stream of revenue.
Palo Alto offered a reliable quality of life; however, explaining funding to
maintain services and upgrade infrastructure to the community was difficult.

Council Member Price believed the Council should consider whether PAUSD
planned a ballot measure in the next three to five years. A very modest
source of income could be naming opportunities for these projects.

Council Member Klein reported the Library campaign had offered naming
opportunities; however, no one provided the needed funding. The Council
should consider any and all funding opportunities, but should not count on
funding from the private sector.

Mayor Yeh stated this had been a series of extraordinary meetings. The
Council would move forward on the issue of infrastructure within Palo Alto.

Mr. Keene was glad to hear the Council's comments regarding the Public
Safety Building. The discussion allowed the Council to share information and
gain perspective, while Staff received feedback. Staff had a great deal of
work to perform relating to the 2014 election.

Mayor Yeh noted this was the last Retreat for the Council.

ADJOURNMENT: The Meeting was adjourned at 8:41 P.M.
