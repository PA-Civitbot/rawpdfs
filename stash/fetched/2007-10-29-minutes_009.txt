Mayor Kishimoto stated she wanted to thank the staff for developing the
options for consideration.

Council Member Kleinberg asked about recommendation number two
regarding backyard and side yard collection whether there was any
information about hillside residents, seniors and disabled residents.

Mr. Roberts stated that hillside residents would require curbside collection.
The disabled or seniors could have services, and staff could propose a
program.

Council Member Kleinberg stated the City Manager’s Report (CMR) would
have a continuation of the backyard/side yard collection for residents who
were medically unable to bring their carts to the curb. She asked whether
the residents would have to have a doctor’s note for this.

Mr. Roberts stated there would need to be a process developed to document
that need and there would be a database of those people.

Council Member Kleinberg asked whether that would be a different process
from those who are seniors or who need a permanent arrangement.

Mr. Roberts stated there would be one process with multiple sub elements
included.

Council Member Kleinberg asked regarding recommendation number five
whether the portion that was suggested to be a staging area on Geng Road
was considered dedicated parkland.

Mr. Roberts stated they were recommending the portion that was not
dedicated parkland.

Council Member Kleinberg asked whether it was contiguous to the acre that
was dedicated parkland.

Mr. Roberts stated she was correct.

Council Member Kleinberg asked whether the properties could be combined
for a playing field type of situation.

Mr. Roberts replied there was no review for the potential uses of the site.

Council Member Kleinberg asked what other options there were for that
staging area.
