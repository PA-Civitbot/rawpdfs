Vice Mayor Klein said with the current proposal the two-year period was
unacceptable because at that point the houses would be occupied. He
stated the Council’s plan was for a grocery store with the leverage of
occupancy.

Council Member Beecham asked whether the suggestion was to not have
housing until after the grocery store was complete.

Vice Mayor Klein stated there would be no building permit until after a
signed lease and requested the developer to propose a new plan that
guaranteed a grocery store.

Mr. McNellis stated the ideal project would be for a simultaneous build.

Mr. Baum asked for the requested language prior to the vote and he
suggested the language be clear that item no. 6 not return for a 2nd reading
unless the project had been accepted.

Mr. McNellis stated if the lease was signed as a pre-condition to the building
permit being issued, and the space was delivered to the market within 30-
days of completion, it would be fine. He said the lease would read “as soon
as the building was complete in accordance with the plan, scheduled
payments began.”

Council Member Kleinberg asked how to lock-in the occupancy of the market
and not the rental payment.

Mr. McNellis stated the lease language provided for specific move-in time,
scheduled payment time, and the duration of tenancy. He requested a
fifteen month schedule.

Mr. Baum asked whether fifteen months was acceptable to the Council.

Council Member Kleinberg stated that was acceptable.

Vice Mayor Klein stated that was acceptable
