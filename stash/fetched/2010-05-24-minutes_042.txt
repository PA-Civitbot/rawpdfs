Council Member Yeh asked for clarification on the depth of the tunnel having
different elevations that ranged from 85 feet to 47 feet.

Mr. Young stated in the Alternatives Analysis there were multiple CalTrain
tracks in the area and there needed to be a grade separation.

Council Member Yeh stated the CalTrain station was North of Oregon
Expressway but the grade discussion was for South of Oregon Expressway.

Mr. Young stated with the option of raising the depth of the tracks, the
CalTrain tracks could remain and the HSR tracks could run underneath.

Council Member Yeh asked where the portal would be located.

Mr. Young stated the portal was 4,000 feet long and started at grade level
just at the south end of Palo Alto. The grade would begin to lower until it
was covered south of Oregon Expressway.

Council Member Yeh asked whether the 2.5 percent grade would continue
downward until the eighty-five foot depth had been reached or the forty-
seven foot depth.

Mr. Young stated once the grading was at 1.5 diameters of coverage it was
considered a tunnel.

Council Member Yeh stated the different points of where the portal could
begin created uncertainty as to what area within South Palo Alto would be
impacted.

Mr. Young stated at this stage, the large tunnel was a single example out of
many options for the actual configuration. By the time the Draft
Environmental Impact Report (EIR) was completed, there should be more
concrete information available.

Council Member Yeh stated from an engineering perspective it would be
good to receive information on the point of entry for the portal.

Council Member Price asked to what degree Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART)
data would be useful in terms of the costs for sound walls and construction.

Mr. Young stated the BART costs had been reviewed although the HSR was a
larger scale on size and impacts.
