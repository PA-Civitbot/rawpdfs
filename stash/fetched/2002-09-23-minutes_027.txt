Council Member Lytle heard at the first Mitchell Park
meeting that the clearance would take approximately six
months to complete.

Ms. Harrison said the time frame was more on community
outreach that was required to make sure that all the people
were involved in the discussion process as to where the
courts were located.

Council Member Lytle clarified the Council had            not
necessarily disclosed all environmental impacts at        the
current time with the options that might be considered.

Mr. Calonne said that was correct.

Council Member Lytle asked whether the City had the same
type of rights and use of JLS school property for tennis
courts as the City had for parkland.

Ms. Harrison said the agreement with the PAUSD was for the
joint maintenance and renovation of fields and tennis
courts. If the Council undertook any renovations of those
courts, that would be part of the agreement.

Council Member Lytle asked whether the City had the same
rights to use of PAUSD property as residents had of City
parkland.

Mr. Calonne said the right was contractual and bound by the
agreement.

Council Member Lytle clarified the Council needed to
negotiate with the PAUSD prior to any assurance the option
was viable.

Mr. Calonne said that was correct.

Ms. Harrison said the City had preliminary conversations
with the PAUSD, but the PAUSD only intended to put back in
place what was there. The negotiation was about making the
courts better than what existed originally.

Council Member Lytle asked whether the City could count on
putting tennis courts into the 100-foot setback for Santa
Clara Valley Water District (SCVWD).
