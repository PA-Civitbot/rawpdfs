Council Member Kniss: Don't forget the League meeting is this week. The
League will be in San Jose. Our Peninsula Division breakfast is on Friday
morning.

Vice Mayor Schmid: On Airport Day, one of the booths was the San
Francisco Airport, and they had a presentation on noise. It had a wonderful
diagram of complaints throughout the South Bay, centered in Palo Alto, with
all the data. I've had copies made and distributed, so each of you should
get a copy of the Airport Director's report.

Mayor Holman: Just one question, comment from me. It's like we've seen a
lot of comments from members of the public and Council Members about
watering City-owned trees. Information has been focused a lot on how we
need to conserve water. I know there's been some information go out about
the need to water trees. There's been some information go out to some
individuals. I'm not quite sure how they've gotten it, but I've seen no real
blanket City communication about the need for trees to get water. If Staff
can follow up on that, Suzanne? Okay, thank you. With that, meeting is
adjourned.

Adjournment: The meeting was adjourned at 11:58 P.M.
