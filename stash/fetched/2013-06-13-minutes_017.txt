                             MINUTES
Mayor Scharff indicated the public hearing would reopen at the meeting
scheduled for June 17.

Council Member Kniss asked what the public would comment on.

Ms. Stump reported Staff would re-notice tonight's item for June 17, 2013.
The notice would be published the following morning.

Ms. Grider would prepare a revised Agenda for the June 17, 2013 Council
meeting.

Ms. Stump explained the Clerk would revise the Agenda to reflect a
continuation of the item.

Council Member Kniss again asked what the public would speak about.

Council Member Burt suggested Staff provide any information regarding the
negotiations to the Council and the public as soon as they received the
information.

Mr. Keene indicated Staff would make their best efforts to publish any
information they received as quickly as possible.

Council Member Kniss inquired whether the public would comment on a new
suggestion or a new decision.

Ms. Stump explained the discussion would concern relatively narrow changes
to the proposed project. If proposed changes were very broad or ambitious,
Staff would advise the Council that it probably could not have a final vote on
Monday.

Mr. Keene added that PAHC clearly indicated the June 30 deadline was
important. There were practical limitations to the number of revisions that
could be made.

Council Member Klein noted the neighborhood also had incentives to reach
an agreement.
