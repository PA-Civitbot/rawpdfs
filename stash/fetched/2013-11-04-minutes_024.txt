                 WORKING MINUTES

Council Member Burt did not want to delay the item further. He inquired of
the maker of the Motion whether Staff should provide recommendations in
response to Council comments in addition to items in the Motion.

Council Member Berman agreed and added that the Council could hold a
broader discussion of the issues at that time.

Council Member Burt felt innovation regarding outreach was great and
supported youths conducting interviews. He suggested Staff contact the
Media Center, teen programs and high school journalism programs for
volunteers.    Youth interviews would provide the opportunity for
multigenerational input.

Mayor Scharff did not support referring the item to the Policy and Services
Committee. If Council Members believed Core Values were community
values, then the Council needed to poll on community values and determine
the level of polling that would indicate a community value. Without polling
Core Values would be Council values. The community had a diverse range of
opinion.
