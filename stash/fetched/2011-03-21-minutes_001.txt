Staff presented the status of the Blueprint for the Development Center
Improvements Project (Project).          Staff indicated that the final
recommendations would return to Council in early July 2011. Staff
mentioned that several Development Center improvements were currently
underway, including centralizing the Development Center management,
implementing a project management system on a test basis, and
researching the establishment of a Special Revenue Fund. The Council
spoke on awareness of all Development Center customers, including
neighbors adjacent to proposed projects, homeowners, and other
stakeholders. The Council discussed utilizing systems implemented in other
communities, concerns regarding the Special Revenue Fund, and the use of
an online permitting module for simple projects. The Council was pleased
with the direction of the Project, and acknowledged the significant effort
Staff had put into the Project.
