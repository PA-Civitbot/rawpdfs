Council Member Holman:    Just to go back to the third-party review
statement. I don't know what that means. Is it a third-party hydrologist
report?

Mayor Burt: I know what it means, but I'm not sure that it's the best
descriptor. Is it a hydrologist that we have currently? I think it is, that we
have a third-party hydrologist.

Ms. Stump: I believe it's an engineer. Geotechnical report.

Mayor Burt:     Let's just say—where it says the "third-party review
statement," substitute that with "geotechnical report."

Council Member Holman: It still would be third-party geotechnical.

Mayor Burt: Yes, third-party geotechnical report.

Council Member Holman: Thank you.

Mayor Burt: Is that acceptable to the maker and the seconder?

Vice Mayor Scharff: It is as long as it is a third-party geotechnical. We're
not adding different requirements than currently exist.

Mayor Burt: That's what she just said.

Vice Mayor Scharff:   I just wanted to make sure, because I was watching
their faces.

AMENDMENT RESTATED AND INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION
WITH THE CONSENT OF THE MAKER AND SECONDER to add to the

each lot.” (New Part D)

MOTION AS AMENDED RESTATED: Vice Mayor Scharff moved, seconded
by Council Member DuBois to:
