Council Member Espinosa stated that the brochure that was presented was
focused primarily on the community challenges on large development
projects and the ideal candidate on these particular values. He was not sure
if there were enough emphasis placed on the need for an understanding of
the significant financial situation in regards to infrastructure and the backlog.

Council Member Yeh asked if candidates would comprehend the many issues
within our community from the brochure.

Mr. Murray stated the brochure might drive the wrong people away and the
candidates were better informed with a better sense of if they were up to
this job.

Mayor Klein stated that was precisely what he wanted Mr. Murray to get out
of the two days of meeting with the community.

MOTION: Council Member Barton moved, seconded by Council Member
Morton to accept the draft brochure for the City Manager position presented
by Bob Murray & Associates incorporating comments from the meeting.

MOTION PASSED: 8-0, Burt absent
