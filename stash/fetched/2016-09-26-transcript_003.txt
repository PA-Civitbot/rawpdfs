Council Member Kniss: No.

Vice Mayor Scharff: Yeah, Number 10.

Council Member Kniss: Yes, to reverse the two of them. To make Number 9
Number 8, and to make 10 Number 9 and vice versa.

Mayor Burt: Do you mean to make Number 9 the last item on the agenda,
is that what you mean?

Council Member Kniss:      Yes, please.   Yes, thank you.     Thank you for
correcting me.

Mayor Burt: Did someone else want ...

Council Member DuBois: (crosstalk) second that.

MOTION: Council Member Kniss moved, seconded by Council Member
DuBois to hear Agenda Item Number 9 - Review and Direction Regarding
Interpretation of Planned Community (PC) Ordinances … as the last Action
Item tonight.

Mayor Burt: Council Member DuBois. Council Member Kniss.

Council Member Kniss: My speaking to it is in terms of self-preservation
primarily, thinking it would be great to go home. We've already discussed it
in Policy and Services. I think that we're well prepared for that, but we're
also recused from Number 9, which regards the four City parking garages.
That is on advice from our City Attorney, because of property located
nearby.

Mayor Burt: Council Member DuBois.

Council Member DuBois: Just remember this, Liz, next time I have to recuse
myself. Thanks.

Mayor Burt: Vice Mayor Scharff.

Council Member Scharff: I also have to recuse myself from this, so I
actually also would appreciate support for this item.

Mayor Burt: Council Member Berman.

Council Member Berman: The concern that I have—I haven't actually been
in consultation with anybody about it, so I don't know if it's a valid concern
or not—is a lot of people or some people came to speak to Item Number 10
