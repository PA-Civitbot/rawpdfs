at Policy and Services. They might have been planning to come to speak to
it tonight, or even more people might have been coming to speak to it
tonight. We're now at the last minute moving that item up an hour and a
half, which might mean that they'll miss their opportunity to speak to the
item they care about. As much as I would love to do my colleagues a favor,
I'm going to vote against this, because I am concerned that there might be
people that want to come speak. This is just not enough notice to them to
have the opportunity to come speak.

Council Member Kniss: I hope there's a roomful.

Council Member Berman: Now, that I've said that, I hope there's a roomful

through Item Number 9 really quickly and this won't be a big issue.

Mayor Burt: Council Member Schmid.

Council Member Schmid: One thing the Mayor could do is have two times
for inputs on Item 9, at the beginning and maybe halfway through the

Council Member Schmid: Yes. Before we lose the three Council Members,
they could vote on 11.

Mayor Burt: Eleven. That's why I clarified Council Member Kniss' Motion to
say 9 would be the last item. I'll just say that I actually concur with Council
Member Berman and would add that we would haveâ€”if we move 9 out, we
have people who are also potentially coming for 9 at 7:45 P.M. or
thereabouts. I think most importantly is that we could have significant
