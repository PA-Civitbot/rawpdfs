Council Member Berman: I'd be okay with that.

MOTION: Chair Burt moved, seconded by Council Member Berman to
recommend the City Council approve the option to perform the
Compensation Survey biennially instead of annually.

Chair Burt: Do you simply want to vote on that? All in favor of trying an
every other year compensation survey.

Vice Mayor Schmid: Yeah.

Council Member Kniss: No. That's the one I'd like every year.

MOTION PASSED: 3-1 Kniss no

Council Member Berman: Do we want MRG to facilitate the discussion?

Ms. Figone: With the support of HR as we did in the current year.

Chair Burt: I think that's valuable.

Council Member Berman: I think so.

Council Member Kniss: Very valuable.

Ms. Figone: Mr. Chair, would you call out the Number 4 also for the Council?
We bring it forward for this report out.

Council Member Berman: The compensation market survey?

Chair Burt: We're not going to have a Staff Report. Is anyone going to be
able to capture what were the actions out of here and provide that to me for
when we have it before the Council?

Ms. Minor: Yes, we can.

Ms. Figone: So far 2 and 4 in our recommendations are being called out.
This is a very simple one. CAO Committee debrief. The current year, we
had one plugged into the schedule. We didn't use it because the yellow
matrix kind of took its place. Our recommendation is to plug in a mid-
session Committee debrief as an optional meeting, not necessarily the tail-
end one. Or we can just take it off altogether.

Chair Burt: How does that differ from what we did today?
