Mr. Emslie said the existing auto uses had already been placed into the
appropriate auto overlay.

Council Member Mossar asked what the P&TC meant by recommending that
the overlay not be placed in one area.

Mr. Emslie said additional auto dealers were not recommended on
Embarcadero Road.

Council Member Mossar asked whether the decision of the P&TC precluded
expansion of one of the existing auto dealers.

Mr. Emslie said that was correct. The current auto overlay allowed for
increases in FAR for auto dealer use.

Council Member Morton said he understood the concerns expressed by the
Council that it would not want auto dealerships backing onto single family
residential properties. Adoption of an auto overlay did not guarantee that
someone could build an auto dealership. The auto overlay was a permissible
use, but a developer had to go through the Planning application process.
Staff was asked whether neighborhood protections were lessened if an auto
overlay were adopted.

Mr. Emslie said being in the auto overlay area did not entitle auto
dealerships to be built in the area without the subsequent review by the
P&TC and Council.

Council Member Morton clarified the P&TC and the Council could protect the
existing neighborhoods by not approving projects that backed onto single
family residential.

Mr. Emslie said the Council had discretion in applying the zone on a site by
site basis.

Council Member Drekmeier said although he did not work at the location, his
employer was at Corporation and East Bayshore and asked whether he
should recuse himself.

Mr. Baum clarified the company was a non profit and Council Member
Drekmeier had no ownership interests.

Council Member Drekmeier said that was correct. The non profit owned the
building at 3921 East Bayshore.

Mr. Baum asked whether the building was in an area that would be rezoned.
