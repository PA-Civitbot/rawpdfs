                         DRAFT MINUTES
Council Member Kniss inquired whether those dates would give the Clerk
enough time to provide the Resolution to the Board of Supervisors.

Ms. Grider reported August 5 would give her four days to provide a Certified
Resolution to the Registrar of Voters as it was due by August 9.

Council Member Kniss inquired whether the Council could vote on a
Resolution as late as August 5.

Ms. Grider responded yes.

Council Member Kniss clarified that a Resolution could be adopted prior to
the Vacation.

Ms. Grider agreed.

MOTION: Council Member Kniss moved, seconded by Vice Mayor Shepherd
to hold Council Break from July 1 through August 2, 2013.

Council Member Kniss felt this schedule would work well with other events in
the community.

Vice Mayor Shepherd noted other Councils along the Peninsula scheduled
their breaks for July, and Council Members often attended regional meetings
during the Vacation.

Council Member Schmid recalled the City Manager mentioned the possibility
of issues with the ending and beginning of the fiscal years. He inquired
whether the Council could have one meeting in July to cover the ending and
beginning of the fiscal years.

James Keene, City Manager agreed there was a great deal of activity with
closing the fiscal year and the Budget, thus a Council meeting could be
needed in July. That could be tempered by more planning and discipline.

Council Member Schmid suggested the beginning date of the Vacation be
changed to July 9 to allow for one Council meeting.

Vice Mayor Shepherd noted a meeting could be held on July 1, 2013.

Council Member Schmid agreed.

Council Member Kniss inquired whether the beginning date would move to
July 2, 2013.
