Center Foundation were selected for a two-year arts management, training,
and consultancy program. The City was seeking applicants for the Human

Oral Communications

Jerry Underdal stated that to the extent legal and financial issues could be
resolved, the Council should provide political support for retaining Buena
Vista Mobile Home Park. Various organizations explicitly called for support
of Buena Vista Mobile Home Park. Hundreds of families had benefited from
existing affordable housing in Palo Alto.      Government assistance was
necessary to providing affordable housing.

Bob Moss suggested Council Members read their packets early and provide
questions to Staff in advance of meetings.
