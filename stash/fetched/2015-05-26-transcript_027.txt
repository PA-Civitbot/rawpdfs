easily get to work. All of us who are here regret it. You have heard our
process tonight and would agree it's a fair process for the owner. We hope
that that door that you may feel has closed tonight will open another door
very soon.

Mayor Holman: I do want to reiterate, perhaps more for the media than
anyone else, that in taking action tonight we do have such a narrow, limited
role in making a determination. In making a decision this evening, it's one
that is not a happy one. It's one that we've done our best to be fair to all
parties, whether it is palatable or not may be another matter. Whether it's
fair to parties, I hope the process has proven to be that. With the addition
of the peer review, we have added an element that assures there is a more
just and impartial aspect to this motion and the action this evening. Council
Members, we will be voting on the board in favor of the Motion with the
additions as you see on the board. Vote on the board please. That passes
unanimously.

MOTION PASSED: 9-0

Adjournment: The meeting was adjourned at 6:54 P.M.
