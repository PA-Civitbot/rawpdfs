MOTION PASSED AS AMENDED 9-0.

MOTION: Council Member Kishimoto moved, seconded by Cordell, to
convey to staff that the sense of the Council is to encourage the use of
electronic media to every extent possible in order to notice.

MOTION PASSED 7-1, Ojakian "no," Morton absent.

Council Member Kishimoto agreed with Council Member Freeman that on-
site posting was more effective than a small ad in the newspaper. She
suggested having staff evaluate on-site noticing as an alternative or
additional notice and bring back recommendations to the Council at the time
of the 12-month review.
