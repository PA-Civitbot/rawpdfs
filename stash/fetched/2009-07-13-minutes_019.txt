COUNCIL MATTERS

10.   Adoption of an Ordinance Increasing the Utilities Advisory Commission
      from Five to Seven Members and Amending Section 2.23.010
      (Membership), Section 2.23.030 (Term of Office) and Section 2.23.060
      (Meetings) of Chapter 2.23 of the Palo Alto Municipal Code.

City Attorney, Gary Baum stated the Council had directed the Utilities
Advisory Commission (UAC) be increased from five to seven members. Staff
provided an Ordinance effectuating the change as directed. He stated there
had been a secondary Ordinance created in the event Council designated the
terms be staggered.

Mayor Drekmeier requested Staff distribute the secondary Ordinance for
review of the options.

Council Member Schmid stated the votes taken and allocated were not quite
the manner in which they happened. He stated the first vote taken was to get
a majority then a second vote was taken.

Vice Mayor Morton stated his concerns that by increasing the UAC
Commission there was the possibility of diluting the necessary skill level.

Council Member Yeh stated the staggered appointment terms made sense
with a larger Commission to make for a smoother transition.

MOTION: Council Member Yeh moved, seconded by Council Member Klein to
1) Adopt the Ordinance amending Section 2.23.010 (Membership), Section
2.23.030 (Term of Office) and Section 2.23.060 (Meetings) of Chapter 2.23
of the Palo Alto Municipal Code, 2) The initial terms of the two members who
received the fourth and fifth highest number of City Council votes on July 6,
2009 shall be one year, and 3) Beginning in 2010, the Commission
appointments shall be staggered so that in each 3 year cycle, two members
are appointed one year, and two members are appointed the next year, and
3 members are appointed the next year.
