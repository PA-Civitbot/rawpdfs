Vice Mayor Scharff: Right, just to evaluate it.

Council Member DuBois: Okay.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to add to the Motion, “including:

A.    Requiring display windows on properties with nonconforming uses; and

B.    Considering adjustments to the Ground Floor (GF) boundary; and

C.    Considering protections outside the GF and for basements; updating
      definitions as needed; and

D.    Options to amortize out certain nonconforming uses along University
      Avenue.”

Mayor Burt: Council Member Holman.

Council Member Holman: I'm wondering if—one, just a little clarification. I
think this is clear, but just to be sure. Including South of Forest, it's really
SOFA II.

Vice Mayor Scharff: Okay, let's go with that.

Council Member Holman: That's SOFA II. To address actually what Council
Member DuBois was saying, a more flexible framework for the City as a
whole, did you mean—maybe to clarify or maybe support what you're
saying—a somewhat more flexible framework?

Council Member DuBois: Yeah.

Council Member Holman: You'll accept that as a friendly amendment?

Vice Mayor Scharff: I think I'd just rather say "more flexible." Let Staff
come back, and we can—this is going to come back to us, and then we can
argue about how flexible we want it to be. I don't want to really give
direction to Staff to say some or not. I want them to come back, and we
can fight about it then.

Council Member Holman: I just heard Staff mention earlier a one year
vacancy. That's not going to cut it.

Vice Mayor Scharff: Not with me either, but let's ...

Council Member Holman: As long as Staff's hearing that.
