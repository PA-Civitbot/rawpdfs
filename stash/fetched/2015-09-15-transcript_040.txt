Council Member DuBois: Mayor?

Mayor Holman: What I would say is that stopping collecting the information
is not included in the Motion, so we would still be collecting it. Council
Member DuBois?

Council Member DuBois: I think part of my Motion got deleted when the
amendment was added. I had changes to the registration survey would be
discussed in Policy and Services.

Council Member Burt: That's right.

Mayor Holman: Where was that, Council Member DuBois?

Council Member DuBois: It was at the end of that second sentence that got
replaced. Maybe we can add it to the first sentence.

Mayor Holman: Can you place it for David please?

Council Member DuBois: Not in the first sentence. Sorry.

Mayor Holman: Second sentence?

Council Member DuBois: I guess after that second sentence. Policy and
Services will discuss changes to the registration survey and meet in a timely
manner, if you want to combine it.

Mayor Holman: Should discuss changes to the registration survey.

Council Member DuBois: And meet.

Mayor Holman: In a timely manner.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to add to the Motion in Part A, “discuss changes
to the Registration Survey” after “Policy and Services Committee should.”

Mayor Holman: Council Member Kniss, is that clarification good with you?
Okay. That gives Staff a clear direction, correct? We are not currently
changing any information being collected.     Jim, did you want to say
something? Oh, yes, you do.

Mr. Keene: (inaudible).

Mayor Holman: Can you give us an idea of when it might get to Policy and
Services? Is there any notion at all? I don't mean to put you on the spot.
