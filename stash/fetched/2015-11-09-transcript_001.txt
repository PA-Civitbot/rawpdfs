Special Orders of the Day

1.   United States Military Veterans Proclamation.

Mayor Holman: Those of you who were here just a little while ago, you were
here for what appears to be Palo Alto's first event that honors our veterans.
In light of that, we have a Proclamation to read. Mayor Holman read the
Proclamation into the record. I would like to, if I could, present this. We
have a few copies of the Proclamation. I would like to present the framed
copy of this, if I could, to Cliff Vrooman, who you heard speak earlier today,
our 91-year-old veteran who came to speak with us earlier. If Gary Higgins,
Todd Seeley and John Preston could join us down here to receive the
Proclamations. For those who couldn't perhaps hear Mr. Vrooman, he said
he accepted that on behalf of the 14 million veterans. Thank you so much
for honoring us with your presence.

2.   Presentation of Award of Accreditation by the American Public Works
     Association (APWA).

Mayor Holman: With that then, we go with the presentation of award of
accreditation by the American Public Works Association. I believe Mike
Sartor has some comments.

Mike Sartor, Director of Public Works: Good evening, Mayor Holman and
Members of City Council. I'd like to introduce to you, standing to my right,
Dwayne Kalynchuk, a former past president of the American Public Works
Association. Flew down today to do the presentation from Victoria, British
Columbia. Thank you, Dwayne, for your time to come down.
