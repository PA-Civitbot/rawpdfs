Brian Bradshaw, 123 Sherman Avenue, said there were boats and storage
containers in other driveways in Palo Alto. The property of Metro Circle was
flooded in 1998, which added to the delay in the completion of the repairs.

Mayor Beecham declared the public hearing closed.

Mr. Bayer said the roof on the Metro Circle house took four to five years to
complete. The property came into compliance after a significant amount of
time, under the order of the hearing officer and the threat of daily penalties.

Council Member Morton asked what kind of financing was available for rental
property in disrepair.

Mr. Bayer said if cash flow were proven, lenders would take it into
consideration.

Council Member Morton asked how cash flow could be demonstrated when it
took four years to put on a roof. He asked if there were complaints from
citizens regarding the properties.

Mr. Bayer said both of the properties were involved in Code Enforcement
actions because of complaints from the public.

Council Member Morton said the primary cause for the Code Enforcement
was complaints from the public.

Mr. Bayer confirmed.

Council Member Morton asked whether the City agreed with the possibility
that no notice of the right to appeal for the hearings was sent.

Mr. Bayer said Mr. Bradshaw was given a copy of the full ordinance or he
was directed to the appropriate places to look for the full ordinance.

Council Member Morton asked whether the standard practice was to send a
notice and document that a notice had been sent.

Mr. Bayer said he said he did not believe that had been done.

Council Member Morton asked whether there was evidence the Bradshaw's
were informed of this right of appeal.

Mr. Bayer said the issue of Mr. Bradshawâ€™s right to appeal was just brought
up that day.
