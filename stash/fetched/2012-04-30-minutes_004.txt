years. On an annual basis, Public Works reorganized operations to save
$356,000 a year.          The Council had contracted a portion of parks
maintenance for Mitchell Park, Rinconada Park, and the Lucie Stern
Community Center, saving $314,000 a year; contracted golf course
maintenance,      reducing    costs  by    $338,000;     contracted   custodial
maintenance; initiated a Computer Aided Dispatch (CAD) Records
Management System (RMS) agreement with the cities of Mountain View and
Los Altos; and initiated a new Procurement Card that would result in some
cost savings and efficiencies. These reductions, together with prior year
changes, reduced the General Fund's structural spending deficit by $14
million and eliminated over 60 positions, approximately 10 percent of the
City's General Fund workforce. Overall, General Fund sources of funds were
budgeted at $151 million, a $4.5 million or 3.1 percent increase over the
Adopted FY 2012 Budget and a $0.7 million or 0.5 percent increase over the
Adjusted FY 2012 Budget adopted by the Council in the past month. Staff
projected solid increases in sales tax, property tax, Transient Occupancy Tax
(TOT), and documentary transfer taxes for FY 2013, but these had been
offset by drops in rental income and other revenues. In the past year, the
City had witnessed a rebound in economically sensitive revenue sources.
Sales taxes, originally budgeted at $20.2 million for FY 2012, were expected
to end the year at $21.6 million.         Based on recent performance, the
projected target for FY 2013 was $22.5 million. Specifically, department
store and electronic sales had spearheaded the rise. Because of increased
business activity, TOT had risen nicely as well. TOT revenues from July
through February of this fiscal year were running nearly 23 percent above
those of the same period in the prior year. Accordingly, Staff had raised the
FY 2012 target from $8.2 million to $8.7 million, and had set an ambitious
goal of $9.6 million for FY 2013. In contrast to other jurisdictions, property
taxes remained stable in FY 2012, and were expected to increase by
approximately $1 million in FY 2013. Documentary Transfer Taxes had
fallen in the current fiscal year compared to FY 2011's stellar performance of
$5.2 million. Staff was optimistically forecasting this revenue source to
slightly exceed $5.0 million in FY 2013.         While some revenues were
recovering, other key revenue sources were still below Great Recession
levels. Sales and Documentary Transfer Taxes projected for FY 2013 were
slightly below actual revenues realized in FY 2008. Other tax revenues, such
as property and TOT, had increased since 2008, but TOT together with other
revenues were not sufficient to cover projected FY 2013 expenses or
projected future expenses forecasted in the City's Long Range Financial
Forecast. The concerted effort to reduce expenditures thus far had not been
sufficient to erase General Fund funding gaps. The FY 2013 General Fund
Proposed Budget was actually $152 million on the expense side, an increase
of $5.6 million or nearly 4 percent over the FY 2012 Adopted Budget. The
main drivers of this increase were rising benefit costs; the lack of
compensation concessions in FY 2012 from the Palo Alto Police Officers
Association and the Police Management Association; and, a recommendation
