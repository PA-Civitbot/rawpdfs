Vice Mayor Klein said with the CS and CN zoning there would be a site and
design review on any housing that comes forth. Commercial use would be
retained with better housing rather than stand-alone housing which would
not be subjected to that type of review. He supported the motion.

Mayor Kishimoto asked for clarification on the school route.

Mr. Emslie said it was along the frontage and throughout the neighborhood
on Monroe Drive.

Mayor Kishimoto asked whether the sidewalks along ECR were up to
standards.

Mr. Emslie said future development would require the appropriate width of
the sidewalks and would be considered in the traffic calming analysis.

Mayor Kishimoto asked whether the South El Camino guidelines for
sidewalks were still in place.

Mr. Williams said yes but new commercial zoning districts required 8 to 12
foot sidewalks and El Camino Real required 12 feet.

Mayor Kishimoto asked whether the landscape would continue on the new
zoning.

Mr. Emslie said yes.

Mayor Kishimoto asked if there was a Conditional Use Permit (CUP) on
evening noise.

Mr. Williams said if noise went beyond 10 P.M. it would require a CUP which
included performance criteria to address noise. The site and design review
would ensure minimization of noise.

MOTION PASSED 8-0, Beecham absent.
