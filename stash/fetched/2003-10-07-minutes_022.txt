Council Member Burch commended the great effort made in using and
reusing materials from the two existing homes. He suggested considering a
photovoltaic solar system for the home.

Council Member Lytle said paved driveways were always considered part of
lot coverage in the past. Permeable surfaces were not excluded and now
staff allowed that exclusion. It increased the ability to develop larger houses
in the Foothills that were never anticipated since the adoption of the original
Open Space (OS) district. She suggested reexamining the maximum house
sizes in the Foothills. She also raised the issue of the market forces driving
lot consolidation. There was a Housing Element policy at one time that
limited consolidation of lots and homes under discretionary approval. It was
lost. She supported Council Member Burchâ€™s suggestion on the photovoltaic
system.

Council Member Morton asked for clarification on heating systems used for
swimming pools. He understood a solar system was required as opposed to
gas or electricity.

Ms. Grote said solar was not required for heating swimming pools.

AMENDMENT: Council Member Morton moved to amend the motion to
require that the underground gymnasium be constructed with the
understanding that there is no permanent water pumping due to excavation
into the water table.

AMENDMENT FAILED FOR LACK OF A SECOND.

MOTION PASSED 9-0.
