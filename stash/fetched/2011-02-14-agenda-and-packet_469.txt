human waste, food waste, and stormwater inflow. Since 1997, the RWQCP has quantified the
relative importance of mercury sources using local sampling information in conjunction with
data from other wastewater treatment plants and the scientific literature. As noted later in this
chapter, the RWQCP’s dental amalgam program, which required dental offices to install
amalgam separator devices in 2005, has significantly reduced mercury loadings from dental
offices. Figure 4-2 presents the mass loading estimates as a percent of the total influent load.
The mercury loading estimate was updated in 2008 to reflect the decreased contribution from
dental offices (“Mercury Headworks Analysis for 2008”, Barron, February 2009). The estimate
also accounts for new information about decreases in amalgam procedures at dental offices and
the greater importance of mercury in human waste resulting from dental amalgam swallowed by
patients during amalgam placement and removal. For comparison, the mercury loading
estimates for 2000 and 2008 are both provided in the Mercury Program Evaluation section.
