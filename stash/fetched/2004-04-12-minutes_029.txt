Vice Mayor Burch asked if there would be traffic enforcement in the
Downtown North area.

Ms. Harrison replied yes.

Vice Mayor Burch said the Sustainable Silicon Valley Project asked for
support from the City for a 20 percent reduction in greenhouse gas
emission.

Council Member Cordell announced she had completed three months on the
Council and commended Mayor Beecham for his running of the meetings;
Council on its healthy discussions; and staff for their work. She also said
that it was inappropriate of Aram James to involve the Council in an
investigation. In response to Dieter Folta, she said it took time to bring
about change, especially where race was concerned.
