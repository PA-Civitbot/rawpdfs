AMENDMENT FAILED FOR LACK FOR SECOND

Vice Mayor Mossar said she understood the concept of the motion but was
uncomfortable about supporting it. She wanted to amend the motion by
taking into consideration all of the monuments, their locations, who owned
them, and their maintenance. The monument could be relocated to a better
place, and she suggested looking into the future treatment of the other
monuments.

Mayor Ojakian said in the way the motion was described, he asked the
Senior Assistant City Attorney whether the motion was general enough to
allow latitude for staff to locate the monument in the best possible location
at the top of the stairs.

Ms. Furth said the motion was clear and presumed that minor adjustments
necessary to deal with engineering issues were acceptable to Council.

Mr. Emslie said he viewed the motion as clear direction.

Council Member Morton requested staffâ€™s proposal on preservation and
restoration or treatment of the remainder of the monuments.

Ms. Furth advised to act on the current motion first and then to direct staff
on treatment of the remaining monuments.

Council Member Burch said he would not support the motion.

Council Member Freeman asked why the monument had to be lowered from
its current location.

Mr. Emslie said by lowering the monument, it reduced the impact to the
structure but would still retain access to it.

Council Member Freeman asked what the distance was to the edge of Alma
Street.

Mr. Emslie said it was approximately 10 feet from the street.

Council Member Freeman asked if by lowering the monument a few steps
would it allow people to congregate around the monument rather than stand
directly on the street.

Mr. Emslie said there was a generous amount of landing area at the top of
the steps at the Alma Street elevation.
