14.   Comprehensive Plan Update – Review of Revised Approach, Schedule,
      Scope of Work, Approval of Amendment Number 2 to Contract
      C08125506 with The Planning Center | DCE in the amount of $597,206
      and Adoption of a Budget Amendment Ordinance 5239 entitled
      “Budget Amendment Ordinance of the Council of the City of Palo Alto
      in the Amount of $200,000 for Consultant Support Related to the
      Ongoing Update of Palo Alto’s Comprehensive Plan for the Future of
      Our City” (Continued from March 3, 2014).

Steven Turner, Advanced Planner, reported Staff had reached the point in
updating the Comprehensive Plan to begin discussions with the Council and
to initiate the environmental review process. Late in 2013, the Council and
Staff began discussions regarding the relationship of the Comprehensive
Plan to other studies such as the Housing Element update, Planned
Community (PC) reform, the Downtown Development CAP Study, and the
Downtown Parking and Traffic Studies. The thought at that time was to
develop a program to capture and foster the relationships between studies
while allowing extensive public engagement efforts. The Our Palo Alto
process was a framework of ideas, actions, and designs with the
Comprehensive Plan update representing the design portion.              The
Comprehensive Plan was built around goals, policies, and programs that
addressed all parts of the City, not only land use.       Elements of the
Comprehensive Plan focused on specific topics. The Business and Economics
and Governance Elements were optional. Only the Council was required to
approve the Comprehensive Plan. The original Comprehensive Plan was
adopted in 1998 and included a Citywide development cap of 1.3 million
commercial square feet and a Downtown cap of 350,000 commercial square
feet. The City had not reached those caps. Per City Council direction, an
updated Comprehensive Plan was not likely to introduce any significant new
                                                                     Page 12 of 27
