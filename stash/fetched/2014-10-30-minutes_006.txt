Ms. Shen said it was in reference to the quality in decision making.

Vice Mayor Kniss felt the wording was awkward and unclear.

Council Member Klein recommended striking the word ability which was used
too frequently in the current flyer.

Mayor Shepherd noted the information was from the recruitment of 1995
with minor updates in 2011.

Ms. Shen agreed to reword.

Vice Mayor Kniss felt the following wording was interesting and should be
addressed for clarity: to maintain custody of public records.

Council Member Klein asked why “the ability to train and supervise staff
members” was a separate bullet point. He was uncertain what was meant by
the phrase “effective discrimination”.

Vice Mayor Kniss was not able to locate the technical requirements added to
the position.

Ms. Shen agreed the flyer needed to be re-written. She added a bullet at the
bottom on technology to apply to agendas, packets, public records requests,
conflict of interest and campaign statements.

Mayor Shepherd suggested calling out the current technology used; Minute
Traq and NetFile. She asked what was meant by conflict of interest and
campaign statements.

Ms. Shen clarified those terms referred to the Fair Political Practices
Commissions (FPPC) forms 700, 460, 410, 470 and the like associated with
contributions.

Council Member Klein requested to see the technology section expanded.

Vice Mayor Kniss agreed.

Council Member Klein suggested adding lines such as “ability and experience
to work with the technological skills of the office and work with the City’s
Chief Technology Officer”. Technology should be a key criterion in the
recruitment.
