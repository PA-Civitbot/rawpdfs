Planning Manager John Lusardi reported that at the March 14, 2005,
meeting the Council took oral testimony, closed the public hearing, and
continued the item to the current meeting. Staff made revisions to the limits
for small second units and second dwelling unit parking exceptions in the
front setback in order to address concerns. Staff responded to the Council’s
written questions addressing issues in the R-1 ordinance. At the previous
meeting, staff recommended allowing small second units on 7,000-square-
foot lots or combining lots that would either be attached or detached. Staff
recommended that small second dwelling units, up to 450 square feet, be
allowed on R-1 lots having 7,000 square feet.

Council Member Morton asked for clarification as to whether the second
housing units on lots of 7,000 square feet or greater would be a one-story
second unit with a one-story house or a two-story second unit.
