MOTION: Council Member Morton moved, seconded by Mossar, to approve
Item 3.b.2: The 2007-08 Budget and the 2008-09 In-Concept Budget,
Pertaining to the Police and Fire Department Budgets as Modified and
Portions of the CIP with the exclusion of Stanford components, and the
Ordinance Portions Related Thereto.

Council Member Morton stated maintaining the staffing of Fire Station 8 at
normal pay rates would not pose a problem. The Union contract determined
the staffing required senior staff at overtime rates.

Council Member Drekmeier asked whether staffing Fire Station 8 was
possible through shifting resources from elsewhere in the community.

Mr. Benest stated the Fire contract calls for a minimum number of staff at all
open stations.

Council Member Drekmeier asked if the motion was approved would the City
be able to meet and confer with the Union to open Fire Station 8.

Mr. Benest stated yes. The Council could request staff to meet and confer
with the Union to work on the minimum staffing requirement.

Vice Mayor Klein asked whether the City allowed the Union access to Fire
Stations for time travel tests as stated earlier by Mr. Lanphier.

Mr. Benest stated time trials were not within the scope of the fire fighter
duty.

Vice Mayor Klein stated his support to approve the motion and the budget.

Council Member Barton recommended an amendment to the motion to direct
City Manager to meet and confer to find other ways to staff Fire Station 8.

Council Member Kleinberg asked whether the amendment process would
happen prior to adopting the entire budget.

Mr. Benest stated the budget adoption went in effect July 01, 2007. The
meet and confer would happen immediately thereafter.

Council Member Kleinberg stated the meet and confer had no impact on the
two-year budget.

Mr. Benest stated conceivably the Union could agree to waive the minimum
staffing requirement.
