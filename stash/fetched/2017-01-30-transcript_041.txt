Council Member Holman: It says Downtown cap of about 45,000 square
feet. Is that 25 or 60? What does the language "about" come from?

Ms. Costello: It's actually the language in the policy. The language in the
policy that this is referring to says specifically limit new office development
in Downtown to 45,619 square feet. I think the overhead just tried to
summarize that, but the …

Council Member Holman: This is referring specifically to Program L-1.16.4
on Packet Page 63. Correct?

Ms. Costello: Yes.

Council Member Holman: Is that the intention?

Ms. Costello: The two options are Option 2 and Option 4, yes.

Council Member Holman:      I just want to make sure, maker and seconder,
that's the intention.

Council Member Filseth: Yes.

AMENDMENT RESTATED: Council Member Filseth moved, seconded by
Council Member DuBois to replace Part C of the Motion with, “Program L-
1.16.4 would retain a Downtown Cap of about 45,000 square feet for
Office/R&D similar to Program L-1.16.2, and would also cap new hotel
development at 50,000 square feet.”

Mr. Keene: I'm assuming that that Packet Page is the same Packet Page as
Packet Page 16, which other folks have in their Packet. Thanks.

Council Member Holman: No, because Packet Page 16 was the generic
references. Packet Page 63 is the actual Comp Plan language. It's more
detailed.

Mayor Scharff: Council Member Holman, are you finished? If we could           vote
on the board. Before you vote, we're voting on the Amendment. A yes           vote
is for the Amendment. A no vote is against the Amendment. That fails          on a
5-4 vote with Council Members Wolbach, Kniss, myself, Tanaka and              Fine
voting no.

AMENDMENT AS AMENDED FAILED:               4-5 DuBois, Filseth, Holman, Kou
yes
