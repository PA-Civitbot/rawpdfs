question of our Staff. Under the proposal that we have here, which doesn't
have the CUP for office, do we have that ability to add ...

Vice Mayor Scharff: It does actually have the CUP for office, because there's
a tiny bit of office. There's 500 or 600 feet.

Mayor Burt: A very small amount. We do have that authority to add that
condition?

Ms. Silver: This is a tough issue, because the increment for the required
BMR is 95 percent. That 95 percent is being paid as a fee instead of
providing ...

Mayor Burt: 95 percent of what? Say that again.

Ms. Silver: Point 95? Yes. The requirement under our BMR Ordinance is
1.95 units. Since our ordinance requires that if it's an increment like that,
they have to pay a fee rather than rounding up. If the applicant is willing to
provide that extra unit as a voluntary measure, that would be fine. If not, in
order to require it as a condition, you would have to link it to one of your
discretionary permits.

Council Member Kniss: Let's ask the applicant. May we?

Mayor Burt: Yep. Do we have an applicant's response to ...

Council Member Kniss: You're all but five percent to a second BMR unit.
You could really endear yourselves to the community.

Mr. Hayes: They don't think they can support that second unit.

Council Member Kniss: They can't go that extra five percent.

Mr. Hayes: The office is a big hit as well.

Mr. Ma: I think if the office component is being completely changed toâ€”the
entire ground floor is retail now. That obviously changes our project in our
eyes. To take the BMR unit which was going to be an in-lieu fee and force
that as a full entitled BMR unit is quite a bit of change to our project as we
envisioned it.

Mayor Burt: Thank you.

Council Member Kniss: Could I finish my (crosstalk)?

Mayor Burt: Yes.
