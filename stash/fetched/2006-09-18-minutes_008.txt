16A. (Old Item No. 14) Recommendation to Direct Staff to Prepare
     Resolutions in Support of Propositions 1C, 1E, 84, 86 California Ballot
     Measures for November 7, 2006, Election

MOTION: Council Member Barton moved, seconded by Beecham, to direct
staff to Prepare Resolutions in Support of Propositions 1C, 1E, and 84, to
vote separately on Propositions 86 and 89, and to vote “no” on Proposition
90, California Ballot Measures for November 7, 2006, Election.

City Manager Frank Benest said cities across the State were opposing
Proposition 90 for very sound reasons. The League of California Cities
(League) recommended the League represent all cities on Proposition 90 and
that cities were not encouraged to adopt separate resolutions.

Council Member Mossar noted the Council was told the League does not
support Proposition 90 and did not want cities to adopt individual
resolutions. There needed to be a statement in the staff report that
explained why the City of Palo Alto cared.

Council Member Morton said the Council needed to take a public position on
the ballot measures. The motion was supported but segregating out two
measures was unfortunate.

Council Member Drekmeier supported adding the “No” on Proposition 90 but
did not support removing “Yes” on Propositions 86 and 89.

Mayor Kleinberg suggested separating out the vote on Propositions 86 and
89.

Council Member Drekmeier suggested adding Proposition 87, which was the
Clean Energy initiative and fit in with the City’s goal of reducing greenhouse
gas emissions.

Mayor Kleinberg said because Proposition 87 was not included in the staff
report, the matter would be on the next week’s agenda.
