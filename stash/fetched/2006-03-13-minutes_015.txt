suggested the recruitment be limited to the Bay Area due to the City’s
inability to offer a salary to compensate for high cost in housing. Secondly,
the City had a reputation about being difficult and challenging in dealing with
planning issues.

Vice Mayor Kishimoto said it would be beneficial in the future to present a
proposal to the Council to allow time to digest the material and make
suggestions.

Council Member Drekmeier asked the maker of the motion to include a due
date of when the reorganization plan should be returned to the Council for
discussion.

Council Member Klein asked to include in the substitute motion “no later
than May 1, 2006”.

Council Member Barton said to refer the reorganization chart to the P&TC
was a form of micro-management by delegation. The organizational chart
had policy components, but was not a policy, and to ask a policy-body to
comment on something that was not a policy was bad management of time.

Council Member Klein said the organizational chart had policy implications
and should be vetted by the P&TC. He did not feel it was unreasonable to
postpone making a decision on such an important issue.

Mayor Kleinberg said several policies were outlined, which were the
foundation for the reorganization chart. It contained fundamental issues on
the delivery of the City’s government in keeping with policies and the
Compensation Plan (Comp Plan) adopted by the Council.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION PASSED 5-3, Barton, Beecham, Morton no, Mossar
absent.
