SPECIAL MEETING

1.   Study Session re Sustainability Indicators

Staff presented the draft of a Sustainability Inventory that would be used for
the coming year to direct activities for the City organization that related to
sustainability. It was not intended to include the community but only the
City. The inventory included 13 categories, such as energy, water, air
quality, and economic vitality. For each category, there was an explanation
of what the category encompassed, such as goals and indicators of progress
in achieving the goals. The inventory was based on the adopted
Comprehensive Plan. The Council had some suggestions as to what
indicators might be included in future versions of the inventory, but in
general the comments focused on the Councilâ€™s support for and pride in the
accomplishments the staff had made in pursuing sustainability.

No action required.

ADJOURNMENT: The meeting adjourned at 6:47 p.m.
