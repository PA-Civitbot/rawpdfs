Council Member Morton said his concern was an outside consultant might
not be familiar with the library system.

Ms. Harrison said staff would not search for a consultant to recreate any of
the work currently being done on the long-range plan by the Library
Advisory Commission (LAC).

Mayor Kleinberg clarified the consultant would execute the recommendations
listed in the Colleague’s Memo.

Ms. Harrison confirmed. Staff would return to the Council with a project
proposal.

Council Member Beecham asked whether staff had the current authority to
hire a consultant.

Ms. Harrison said there was neither budget nor staff to do the work.

Council Member Beecham clarified a Budget Amendment Ordinance (BAO)
was needed.

Ms. Harrison said staff would return with an estimate of the resources and a
proposal to use the City Manager’s Contingency Fund, the Council’s
Contingency, or another source to provide the resources to complete the
project.

Council Member Beecham clarified staff believed spending $20,000-$30,000
would be beneficial in terms of innovations and collaborations.

Ms. Harrison said the former Library Director strongly believed spending the
money would be beneficial.

Council Member Beecham said he supported the recommendation.

Council Member Cordell said the incoming Director might decide that
$20,000 was not the best way to spend the money immediately.

Wayne Martin, 3607 Bryant Street, said the public was more important than
a Director where libraries were concerned, and the public would get access
to 5.5 million books if Link Plus were added to the library.

Council Member Klein said the City was proceeding to adopt the master plan
for the library system, and the LAC was moving forward with a program that
was before the Council a few months prior.

Council Member Cordell asked whether the motion had to do with Link Plus.
