Faith Bell, 536 Emerson Street, said a five-story structure next to her
property would eliminate her ability to provide solar subsidized photo voltaic
energy. Her customers used Lot P for many years and preferred open lots to
structures.

Irvin Dawid, 753 Alma Street, Apt. 126, said he understood the extra
parking was considered a community benefit. The City needed to institute a
managed type of parking where a price system was used.

Mayor Kleinberg asked the City Attorney to comment on the issue of public
benefit.

Mr. Baum said the public benefit must arise from the site itself. The offsite
parking could not be considered by the Council to satisfy requirements in the
PC zone.

Mayor Kleinberg asked each of the Council Members to indicate whether they
would be happy with the developer proceeding with more detailed plans on
Plan B.

Council Member Beecham said he wanted to see Plan B developed further.

Council Member Drekmeier said if a housing component were added, he
might support Plan B.

Council Member Cordell said she did not support Plan B because of recent
issues raised by the owner of Bells Books. She did not believe the proposal
was a public benefit.

Council Member Morton said he supported Plan B being to be investigated
further.

Council Member Mossar said she agreed with Council Member Morton.

Council Member Barton said he shared the interest in Plan B but had
concerns about the parking and public benefit.

Mayor Kleinberg said she wanted to see more details on Plan B but was
concerned about shadows cast on neighboring projects.

No action required.
