                      Section 4: Mercury Program

 Mercury, a 303(d)-listed pollutant for San Francisco Bay, is present in both wastewater
 and stormwater discharges to the Bay. Figure 4-1 presents the estimate of mercury
 sources to the San Francisco Bay, based on the Regional Boardâ€™s September 2004
 TMDL Proposed Basin Plan Amendment and Staff Report (Regional Board, 2004). Bed
 Erosion and the Central Valley Watershed are the two largest source of mercury to the
 San Francisco Bay, with the single largest contributor being the historic legacy of
 abandoned mercury mines.
