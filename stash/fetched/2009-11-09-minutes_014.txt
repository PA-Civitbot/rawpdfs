Mr. Larkin clarified the Density Bonus Law stated the written standards
needed to be in-place at the time the project was deemed complete.

Council Member Espinosa asked whether Staff felt complex projects
benefited from having the P&TC review them even though it was not
required. He asked whether something substantive could be missed without
their input.

Mr. Williams recognized the ARB and P&TC had different processes although
both were cognizant in their analysis with SOFA requirements, zoning codes,
and state laws.

Council Member Espinosa stated it was important to have land use processes
in place so when Applicants applied for projects they had a written
understanding of how their project would flow from beginning to end.

Council Member Schmid requested Staff to clearly state what was being
voted on.

Mr. Williams stated the Council would be certifying an EIR that included not
only the original proposed project but also an alternative that was specific to
this project. Then there would be approval under the SOFA guidelines, under
the zoning criteria, and Architectural Review approval for the 50-unit
project.

Council Member Schmid asked whether there would be a discussion of the
local statute for the Housing Accountability Act.

Mr. Larkin stated there would be a discussion for the Density Bonus Act not
the Housing Accountability Act.

Mayor Drekmeier asked whether Density Bonus Act was SB1818.

Mr. Larkin stated yes.

Council Member Schmid stated a single project could not be applied to the
impact on schools, although; it was appropriate to review the overall impact
on schools in regards to the growth plan during the planning process. He
asked whether that statement was correct.

Mr. Larkin stated yes, generally that was the process.
