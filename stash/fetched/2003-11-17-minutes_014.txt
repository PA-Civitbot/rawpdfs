Council Member Kleinberg underscored the owner's intent was to touch upon
the land carefully and to respect the environment. She said Mr. Kniss was a
gourmet cook and already an amateur ham radio operator. The proposed
project was an extension of his active and long-pursued hobbies.

Council Member Freeman expressed support for the motion.

Council Member Kishimoto expressed support for the motion although she
had a concern about how a private radio antenna with dimensions of 36 feet
by 36 feet going up to 40 feet was allowed without a CUP. She asked
whether an antenna of similar dimensions was allowed elsewhere in Palo Alto
without a CUP.

Mr. Turner said amateur radio facilities would be allowed in residential
districts without a CUP. Commercial telecommunications facilities, such as
cellular phone towers, were utility facilities and required CUP's in almost
every zone district.

Council Member Kishimoto clarified the only limitation was the 40-foot height
limit, which was met because of the 25-foot plus 15-foot antenna.

Mr. Turner said that was correct.

Council Member Kishimoto clarified the footprint of the antenna was not
included because it was just the frame.

Mr. Turner said the antenna structure was a pull-type structure with a small
foundation that was technically counted as an impervious surface.

Council Member Kishimoto said she was in favor of the motion.

Vice Mayor Beecham said there were a number of good comments made
about ham radio operators in the United States. They had become a vital
part of the emergency communication systems. When there were disasters
in the U.S., ham radio operators were often the ones to get messages out
and assist communications. He expressed support for the motion.

MOTION PASSED 9-0.
