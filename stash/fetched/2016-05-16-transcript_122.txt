Council Member Questions, Comments and Announcements

Mayor Burt: We now go to Council Member Comments and Questions.
Council Member Holman.

Council Member Holman: Just one quick comment, and it was a question
that was raised earlier. It was a question raised earlier about PCs and public
benefits. There was a time that PCs did not have public benefits associated
with them. It came up during a prior discussion this evening. Some of the
PCs did not have public benefits. They were introduced at a later period in
time.

Adjournment: The meeting was adjourned at 12:41 A.M.

Mayor Burt: On that note, we're adjourned.
