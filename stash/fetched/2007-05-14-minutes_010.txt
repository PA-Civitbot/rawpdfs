AMENDMENT FAILED FOR LACK OF A SECOND.

Council Member Drekmeier asked the number of votes required to move
forward.

City Attorney Gary Baum stated five votes were required.

Council Member Drekmeier asked whether the current proposed plan was
consistent with the comprehensive plan.

Assistant Director of Planning and Transportation Curtis Williams stated the
language in the Comprehensive Plan was not specific to consistency.

Mr. Baum stated charter cities were not generally required to follow the
General Plan.

Council Member Drekmeier requested the Alma Street turn lane be
lengthened for a smoother traffic merge.

AMENDMENT TO THE MOTION: Council Member Drekmeier moved to
modify the wording of No. 1 to “delete one housing unit and add 1,865
square feet of retail services/offices.”

AMENDMENT FAILED FOR LACK OF A SECOND.

AMENDMENT TO THE MOTION: Vice Mayor Klein said the language in No.
1 should remain as stated, but add a sentence stating that the applicant and
staff may agree on a substitute as long as it produces the same amount of
additional ground floor retail.

AMENDMENT FAILED FOR LACK OF A SECOND.

Council Member Drekmeier stated he cut the square footage of the building
in half and what was suggested was less commercial with all ground floor
retail.

Vice Mayor Klein stated the ground floor square footage was the same ratio
as the other two sites.

Council Member Drekmeier stated each building had a total of 1,860 square
feet with half on the ground level and half on the upper level. To be
consistent, 930 square feet of retail would be required with an equal amount
of 2nd floor retail.

Mr. Williams stated that was correct.
