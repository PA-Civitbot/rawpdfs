Council Member Lytle said the League of Cities advised that cities adopt a
Code of Ethics to provide context and framework for Protocols and Conduct
Codes. A Code of Ethics addressed several issues that were brought up at
the P&S Committee meeting, including charges or personal allegations
against each other.

Vice Mayor Beecham suggested Council Member Lytle raise the issue during
Council Comments.

Council Member Lytle believed a Code of Ethics was a necessary part of a
Protocol discussion. She said she would bring up the Code of Ethics issue
when the Protocols were brought back to the Council for further discussion.

Ms. Harrison said the Protocol discussion would be added to the April 14,
2003, agenda as Unfinished Business.

MOTION: Council Member Kishimoto moved, seconded by Lytle, to continue
the discussion to the April 14, 2003, regular City Council meeting.

MOTION PASSED 7-1, Freeman "no," Mossar absent.

Council Member Kleinberg asked whether the amended version of the
Protocols would be available prior to the April 14, 2003, meeting.

Ms. Harrison said yes.
