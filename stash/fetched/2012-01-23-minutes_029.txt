Vice Mayor Scharff asked if the language should be "consider excluding
1880."

Council Member Burt stated he was excluding 1880 tonight and directing
Staff to consider alternative locations, which language did not preclude Staff
from concluding 1880 was the best location.

Council Member Shepherd asked how that language was different from the
original Motion.

Council Member Burt explained the original Motion limited Staff to one
alternative location, 1920.

Vice Mayor Scharff inquired if makers and seconders were giving Staff the
discretion to make the determination, with an appeal from that
determination, under both scenarios.

Council Member Klein thought asking Staff to review other locations
exceeded the Council's authority in that the Council did not select all the
sites. He recalled that both the 1880 and 1920 sites were acceptable to
AT&T.

Council Member Holman did not feel the Council was overstepping. She
added the basis for the denial of 1880 tonight was based on the visual
impacts and the effect on that property. She noted Staff had not considered
the park setting, 1960.

Council Member Burt suggested the language should be "alternative
locations that would meet the services needs of that cell area."

Vice Mayor Scharff asked if Council Member Burt would like to speak further
to his second.

Council Member Burt did not know if 1920 was the better alternative. He
thought there were some open questions. He indicated this was a Staff
decision, but the Council was asking for re-examination. He stated the
decision was appealable if there were not better options.

AMENDMENT PASSED: 7-1 Shepherd no, Yeh not participating

Council Member Burt spoke to the subsequent applications being compliant
with the Council’s future Wireless Master Plan.
