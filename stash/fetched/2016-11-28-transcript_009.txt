Mayor Burt: That passes 9-0. I'm sorry.

MOTION FOR AGENDA ITEM NUMBERS 2, 4-8 PASSED: 9-0

[Council returned to Approval of Minutes.]

Mayor Burt:    Mr. Keene, any thoughts on when we should take up Item
Number 3?

Mr. Keene: I'll ask our Planning Director here. I think there's some
sensitivity to being able to stay on schedule and ensuring we have the
funding. The question is are you the only one who's going to deal with this?
It's your call. Ms. Gitelman is here this evening. She'll be here for the last
item on the Council's agenda, and she's also here right now. It's the
Council's pleasure.

Mayor Burt: Why don't we go ahead and make Item 3 a new Item 8a? Is
that the way to do it? Which means now.

Mr. Keene: It'll be now.

Mayor Burt: Council Member Schmid, would you like to go ahead and
explain why you pulled the item? Whether you have a question or what.

Council Member Schmid: I apologize for not informing Staff about pulling it.
I missed getting the response on my email and only got it at places. The
issue is that on November 7th, when we're looking at defining the new
Scenario 5, there was amendment made to the Motion to reduce the
nonresidential square footage from 2.7 to 2.4. That was done, but the job
number remained the same. It seems to me there was a choice that the
Staff faced of whether to reduce the jobs with the new square footage or to
leave the jobs alone. Reducing the number of new jobs with the reduction in
                                                                         Page 9 of 114
