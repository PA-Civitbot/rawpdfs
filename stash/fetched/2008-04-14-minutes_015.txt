AMENDMENT PASSED: 7-2, Klein, Morton, no

INCORPORATED INTO MOTION WITH CONSENT OF MAKER AND
SECONDER that if any donor name, corporate or individual goes bankrupt
and out of business, convicted of a felony or is otherwise guilty of moral
turpitude the name would be removed without giving the monies back.

Council Member Burt asked for clarification on the revocation of a
corporation between bankruptcy or close of business. He suggested that if
the corporation files for Chapter 7 the revocation take place.

Mayor Klein agreed.

Council Member Morton stated the Motion seemed unnecessarily restrictive.

Council Member Schmid asked whether the Motion included or excluded
Stanford.

Council Member Kishimoto stated Stanford was not a corporate foundation.

Ms. Silver stated additional language would need to be included such as
educational institutions or non-profit organizations.

Ms. Morariu stated the Policy was written to read if the entire exterior of the
facility was being named, the Council would review the possibility and make
a decision.

Council Member Burt stated not all businesses were corporations and asked
why that term was being used.
