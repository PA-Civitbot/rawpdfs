Council Member Klein did not understand how voting on this Ordinance in
September, as recommended in the Staff report, complied with the City’s
Charter.

Mr. Baum stated that in order to comply with CEQA, and the City’s Charter,
the City Council would need to place the Initiative on the ballot, or to direct

challenge.

may be seen. He stated the Negative Declaration may present problems.

change when they seem necessary.
