SPECIAL ORDERS OF THE DAY

2.   Community Partners Non-Profit Presentation-Gamble Gardens.

Jane Stocklin, Gamble Garden volunteer shared with the Council that Miss
Gamble cherished her garden at 1431 Waverley Street.         It engaged her
mind and her creativity and she was a faithful steward of the highest regard
for the property. She passed that stewardship to the City of Palo Alto, who
then passed it to a dedicated group of people who had vision and a plan to
keep her values thriving through a community horticultural gathering place.
The Elizabeth F. Gamble Garden was born on May 13, 1985. Gamble Garden
has been noted as a Point of Historical interest in the State of California.
Since 1985, conservatively, $1.4 million dollars has been invested to refresh
the original character of the 109 year-old house and garden. Volunteers
continue to design, plant, and maintain, with a fine-tuned schedule, the 2.5-
acre cozy garden. They welcome 25,000 guests annually, young and old,
many who stroll, find a moment of solitude and drink in the broad beautiful
view of the garden while others attend classes, demonstrations, docent tours
and a myriad of fun events within the boundaries of a bustling garden. They
rely on support from our members, rentals, classes, endowment,
fundraising, and special events such as Spring Tour.
