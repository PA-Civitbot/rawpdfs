Council Member Holman felt the Council would have the park design
discussion to determine where the Julia Morgan building would be located.
She felt it would be a shame to lose the Julia Morgan building to Menlo Park.

Council Member Schmid supported the Motion. He felt the changes that
could come on connectivity were as important as the Julia Morgan building.
If the Quarry Road overpass and the Everett underpass were completed, the
park would be easily accessible. If there was development to the south of
the park, the parking spaces in the park would become a valuable
commodity. He hoped the Council could integrate the possibilities of this
park.

Council Member Burt asked how many bike racks were located by the dog
park.

Mr. Snyder stated there were approximately five racks by the dog park and
each rack held two bikes, for a total of ten bikes.

Council Member Burt suggested the racks by the dog park should be
relocated in the park. He asked what the replenishment rate was for the
Park Impact Fee.

Mr. Betts indicated it varied quite a bit, but the average was approximately
$200,000 to $300,000 per year.

Council Member Burt asked for the life of the artificial turf.

Mr. Betts stated eight to ten years.

Council Member Burt asked how much it cost.

Mr. Betts said $800,000 for the soccer field.

Mr. Snyder indicated the cost of the actual surface carpet was approximately
a quarter of the $800,000.

Council Member Burt expressed concerns about spending that amount of
money for a field used primarily by non-residents. He felt the Council should
provide Staff with guidance as to the location of the Julia Morgan building so
that the park design could accommodate it, rather than trying to fit the
building into an established park design.

Vice Mayor Scharff asked the City Attorney if that topic was within the
Agenda.
