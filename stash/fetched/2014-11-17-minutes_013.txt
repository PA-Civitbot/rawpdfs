Action Items

10.   Approval of Third Amendment to the Lease Between the Palo Alto
      Unified School District and the City of Palo Alto at the Cubberley
      Community Center.

James Keene, City Manager, urged the Council to approve the lease
amendment. He met with Superintendent Max McGee and negotiated a
lease that was responsive to the Council's directions issued in February
2014. The terms of the lease amendment eliminated the Covenant Not to
Develop; converted the annual payment into an infrastructure fund for
maintenance and capital projects at Cubberley; would expire in five years;
required the City and Palo Alto Unified School District (PAUSD) create a
Master Plan to guide long-term planning; included a 3 percent annual
adjustment towards the remaining portions of the agreement; and shared
the risk of potentially losing Foothill College as a tenant.

Mayor Shepherd reiterated that Agenda Item Number 12 was deferred to
December 1, 2014.
