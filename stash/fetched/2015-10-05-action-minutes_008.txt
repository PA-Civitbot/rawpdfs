                   ACTION MINUTES
Council Member DuBois also attended the League Conference, including
sessions on drones and labor negotiations. He will share information with
the City Manager about two companies which specialize in attracting retail
businesses. He would like to schedule a Council Study Session to discuss
impacts of the 2016 Super Bowl, including opportunities for businesses and
potential law enforcement and AirBnB challenges.

Council Member Scharff reported on the potential for the Metropolitan
Transportation Commission (MTC) to cease funding the Association of Bay
Area Governments (ABAG). ABAG may not have sufficient funding to
continue without the support of MTC. ABAG is more representative of cities
the size of Palo Alto than MTC. It is difficult for Council Members to gain
appointment on MTC. Each city has an ABAG representative. He requested
Council Members provide him with their thoughts. He requested Staff
provide an update on infrastructure funding and planning in particular
related to the increase in Transient Occupancy Tax (TOT) this past
November.

Council Member Berman supports Staff further researching the ABAG/MTC
issue. He also supports additional information regarding infrastructure. He
highlighted the effort and initiative of Human Relations Commissioners
Mehdi Alhassani and Greer Stone in organizing the Veterans Summit this
past Friday. Santa Clara County has the largest percentage of unhoused
veterans in the county.

Mayor Holman highlighted the Senior Summit held by the Human Relations
Commission last year and announced the Domestic Violence Summit next
month, also held by the Human Relations Commission.

Adjournment: The meeting was adjourned at 11:19 P.M.
