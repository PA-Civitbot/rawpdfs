MOTION: Vice Mayor Scharff moved, seconded by Council Member Klein to
reopen recruitment for the Planning and Transportation Commission
unexpired term ending on July 31, 2013.

Vice Mayor Scharff felt the Council was divided, and reopening the
recruitment could solve the issue.

Council Member Burt noted one candidate was unavailable for an interview,
and was currently part of the process.

Council Member Shepherd confirmed those candidates previously
interviewed would remain candidates. She asked if the Council would
interview the previous candidate as well as new candidates.

Ms. Grider reported the ballot would include prior candidates as well as new
candidates.

Council Member Shepherd inquired whether the Council would interview
previous candidates a second time.

Ms. Grider stated that was the Council's decision.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER that only new applicants would be interviewed.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION: Council Member Holman moved, seconded by
Council Member Schmid to interview the candidates who did not get selected
along with any new applicants who submitted applications when the
recruitment reopened.

Council Member Holman noted it would be some time before interviews
could be scheduled, and felt prior interviews would be stale at that time.

Mayor Yeh suggested the Council vote a third time. He advocated for Susan
Fineberg, and would not support the Substitute Motion.
