                     FINAL MINUTES
Ms. Van Der Zwaag advised that from 1993 to 2003, HSRAP received
Consumer Price Index (CPI) increases of 3 percent every year. In 2005 and
2009, HSRAP funds were reduced by 5 percent each year. In 2002-2003,
the HSRAP Budget was $1.3 million. Ten years later, the Budget was
$100,000 less.

Council Member Burt added that in 2002-2003, the $1.3 million Budget
amount was slightly more than 1 percent of the City's total Budget.
Currently, the HSRAP Budget was well below 1 percent of the City's total
Budget. If the Council allocated an additional $200,000 to HSRAP, HSRAP's
proportionate share of the City's total Budget would not approach the
amount in 2002-2003. The Finance Committee also discussed the open-
ended nature of the recommendation and increased funding for PACCC and
Avenidas. The wording of the Motion allowed inclusion of PACCC and
Avenidas for additional funding.

Ms. Van Der Zwaag noted the recommendation was left open because of the
uncertainty regarding PACCC and Avenidas remaining as HSRAP agencies.

Council Member Burt reported the Finance Committee also discussed a rainy
day fund for HSRAP. Perhaps some portion of the $200,000 amount should
be placed in a rainy day fund for HSRAP. He did not understand that the
funding source would be the Council Contingency Fund. He thought the
Finance Committee would examine additional funding as part of the Budget
process. The Finance Committee wanted to give the HRC the opportunity to
make specific recommendations for additional funding should the City have
sufficient funds.   The Finance Committee explicitly stated it was not
committing $200,000 in additional funding. The Finance Committee wished
to hear the HRC's recommendations regarding requests which were
previously denied as well as new programs.

Ms. Van Der Zwaag clarified that in theory not every agency currently
receiving HSRAP funding would receive an increase.

Council Member Holman referred to Attachment 8-A, a chart of requested
funding amounts from two-year agencies. She asked how the HRC would
review funding requests versus funding allocations for PACCC and Avenidas.

Ms. Van Der Zwaag advised that PACCC and Avenidas each requested
$40,000 more than they were allocated in the current six-year contract.

Council Member Holman agreed with Council Member Burt that the Finance
Committee understood additional HSRAP funding would be a budgeted item.
The Motion authorized the HRC to utilize additional funding up to $200,000
and directed the HRC regarding a range of a few other things. She
