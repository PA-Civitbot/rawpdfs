RECOMMENDATION
Staff recommends that the City Council approve and authorize the City Manager to execute the
attached contract with Bellecci and Associates Inc. (Attachment A) in a not to exceed amount of
$172,590 for civil engineering and landscape architectural design services for the San Antonio
Medians and Street Improvements Capital Improvement Program (CIP) Project (PE-00104),
including $156,900 for basic services and $15,690 for additional services.

BACKGROUND
San Antonio Road between Alma Street and Highway 101 contains center and frontage medians
and is badly in need of repair and upgrading.      The medians are currently planted with Stone
Pine trees that have grown too large for the medians and the root systems have reached outside
the medians and under San Antonio Road. The root systems have caused extensive damage to
the median, sidewalk and curb in many locations. The tree roots have caused uplifted roadway
and many costly base failure repairs over the years. The uplifted roadway and curb also interferes
with drainage and can cause increased vehicle noise. Many of the trees have already been
removed due to structural problems associated with their size and age. Trenching for irrigation
in the median islands with the existing Stone Pines is unfeasible as it would destabilize the trees.
Other methods of boring and pulling irrigation tubing would be too expensive. The remainder of
the landscaping is currently in decline or nonexistent due to broken irrigation systems, damage
from cars and gophers.

DISCUSSION
The scope of work for this project, as identified in CIP PE-00104 San Antonio medians, involves
the reconstruction of the medians including replacing trees, irrigation systems, landscaping and
curbs as necessary. Professional engineering, landscape and environmental consultant services
are needed to:
    â€¢ develop a concept plan for renovating the San Antonio Road medians from Alma to
       Highway 101;
