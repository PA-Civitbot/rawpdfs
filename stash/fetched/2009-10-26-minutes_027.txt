Mr. Perez requested continuity that would be present with Axon Solutions,
Inc.

Council Member Klein requested whether the City had an evaluation of Axon
Solutions Inc.â€™s work and whether they consulted the City on problems that
may transpire.

Mr. Perez stated problems were expected in the initial implementation of any
complex project. He indicated an independent review of Axon Solutions Inc.
would be the best approach if the City Council felt it was needed.

Vice Mayor Morton inquired whether Staff felt once migration and unforeseen
issues where resolved would customer service improve.

Ms. Fong stated the SAP customer service management software was
complex and cumbersome. It was her hope that customer service would
improve after post-implementation issues were resolved.

Vice Mayor Morton stated telephone calls would raise online support due to
the need to train customers on the new online SAP software.

Council Member Burt inquired when the RFP originally was generated.

Mr. Perez stated the RFP was originally generated in 2007.

Council Member Burt stated that utility bill amount did not match between
the bill stub and inside the detail of the body.

Mr. Ramberg stated that was correct in some utility bill statements.

Council Member Burt inquired how unmatching bill amounts would be in
conformance with the contract with Axon Solutions Inc.

Mr. Perez stated the above issue was rectified, and Axon Solutions Inc.
provided the City with a credit of approximately $20,000.

Council Member Burt asked whether the $20,000 fully covered the billing
error.

Mr. Ramberg stated the discovery of the billing issue was within the time
period that Axon Solutions Inc. was contractually bound to fix the issue.

Council Member Burt stated more performance-based elements were
needed. He inquired whether the proposed Amendment had moved in that
direction.
