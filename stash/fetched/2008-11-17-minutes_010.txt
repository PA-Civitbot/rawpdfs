Council Member Morton asked the City Attorney the specifics of parking pits
in order to accept the Negative Mitigated Declaration. He stated the middle
spot was useless with all the maneuvering and was ineffective. He asked if
he could make a stipulation on the pits, whether the applicant or architect
agreed or disagreed.

City Attorney Gary Baum clarified the question that he wanted to require the
pit to be dug.

Council Member Morton stated he wanted a requirement for the pit at this
pre-building stage, removing the need for later modifications.

Mr. Baum stated this was a legitimate condition but not applied to the
Negative Mitigating Declaration. He stated it was grounds for denial if the
parking was not adequate.

Council Member Morton asked if it was correct process to move forward with
that condition.

Mr. Baum stated this was the case, but the applicant would be allowed to
comment.

Mr. Morton asked the applicant if he would consent to making the pit a
requirement and not an option.

Mayor Klein asked the applicant to respond. He stated the issue was spoken
to by Council Member Morton himself. This was not an act of Council.

Mr. Weltes stated from a practical standpoint the expense of the pits would
jeopardize the LEED Gold level.

Council Member Morton asked how the pits affected the LEED Gold.

Mr. Welte stated the economics of the extra pits affected the amount left
over for other needs.

Council Member Morton stated with foundations digging equipment in the
area, he could not see how this would undermine the LEED Gold.

Mayor Klein stressed the need to close the Public Hearing and consider the
issue.

Council Member Morton asked for a further explanation on the effects of the
pit construction on the LEED Gold standards.
