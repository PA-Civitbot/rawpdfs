Vice Mayor Beecham suggesting adding that parking requirements
would apply to TDRs transferred to a site within SOFA 2 and not within
a parking district.

Council Member Freeman asked for clarification on item 6(d) which
indicated that the donor parcel would be dedicated as public open
space away from the project site. The concern was removal of open
space was encouraged in the district in favor of the open space going
other places. Pocket parks might be a good idea.

Mr. Emslie responded that the open space must be within the SOFA
area.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF
MAKER AND SECONDER to add to the end of the first sentence in
Item 6(d) “within the SOFA 2 area.”

Mr. Emslie said a developer would be able to purchase a piece of
property and get credit if the property were turned into dedicated open
space.

Ms. Furth said there would be a separate parcel dedicated to the City,
rather than open spaces within projects.

Council Member Kleinberg said TDR creative solutions might allow for
individual parks within neighborhoods.

MOTION PASSED 7-0, Morton, Mossar “not participating.”

Council Member Kishimoto clarified the TDR to a SOFA site, which was
outside the parking assessment district, was not exempt for parking
but was subject to CUP and TDM negotiation.

Mr. Emslie responded that any TDR needed to comply with the parking
requirements of the zone it was being applied to.

MOTION: Council Member Ojakian moved, seconded by Burch, to
accept the staff recommendation on Item 7. Non-Complying Facilities
Provisions (“Grandfather Clause”), with any reference to FAR updated

Council Member Ojakian noted that the Planning and Transportation
Commission (P&TC) deleted the wording in Item 7 ( c), “If the shift will
make the building more suitable for retail use or for housing.” There
