ACTION ITEMS

1.   Approval of Letter Regarding Santa Clara County Transportation
     Project Sales Tax Increase (CONTINUED FROM JUNE 2, 2014).

Richard Hackmann, Management Analyst, reported Carl Guardino, Chief
Executive Officer (CEO) of the Silicon Valley Leadership Group (SVLG), gave
a presentation before the Council on May 19, 2014. According to Mr.
Guardino, preliminary polling indicated strong support within Santa Clara
County for a 1/4 cent sales tax increase. Mr. Guardino outlined SVLG's
proposal to spend the sales tax increase totaling approximately $3.5 billion
over the 30-year life of the tax increase. Approximately $500 million or one-
seventh of the total tax increase would support Caltrain. The Council
referred the item to the Policy and Services Committee (Committee) for
additional discussion.     At its May 20, 2014 meeting, the Committee
unanimously recommended the Council consider sending a letter to SVLG
recommending a 3/8 cent sales tax increase with the additional 1/8 cent
funding provided exclusively to Caltrain modernization including grade
separations.

Council Member Price indicated the Committee held a lively discussion of the
issue. The Committee wished to emphasize the critical importance of
Caltrain to the region in general and Bay Area Rapid Transit's (BART)
