MOTION: Vice Mayor Klein moved, seconded by Kleinberg, to approve
staff’s recommendation to adopt the first reading of an ordinance that
approves Planned Community (PC) zoning for the three properties located at
3401, 3415, and 3445 Alma Street, subject to public benefits and conditions
of approval, as outlined by the City Council at its April 16, 2007 meeting,
and refer the project to the Architectural Review Board and Planning and
Transportation Commission for site development plan review with the
following changes:
1)     The three commercial out-buildings, “D” Street and associated
       removable bollards shall be sited to enhance the retail quality of this
       portion of the property. The Applicant and staff may consider
       alternative configurations provided that an equivalent ratio of ground
       floor commercial is provided;
2)     Change the minimum size of the grocery store to 15,000 square feet.
       The 15,000 square feet may include retail subtenants and services that
       are compatible with the intended use of the grocery store to provide
       food services, and shall be more specifically defined as part of the
       approval of the site development plan;
3)     No building permit shall be approved (other than for up to 4 model
       homes) for residential development prior to submittal to the Director
       of a lease agreement or other legally binding commitment from a
       grocery operator to occupy the 15,000 square feet of grocery store
       used in the mixed use building. Occupancy of the grocery store shall
       occur not later than 15 months after issuance of building permits for
       the retail development. No final inspection and occupancy (other than
       for up to 4 model homes) of residential development mixed use
       building shall be permitted prior to final inspection and occupancy
       approval for the grocery use. Bonding or other financial security may
       be considered in lieu of these requirements only upon review and
       approval by the City Council as an amendment to the Planned
       Community (PC) ordinance;
4)     Regarding the community room, add the language proposed by staff
       that basically states that prior to approval of the site development
       plan, the Developer would provide written documentation as to how
       the room would be used, for how long and appropriate enforcement
       mechanisms;
5)     Add the suggested language by staff to Section 4(d) of the proposed
       Ordinance to assure compliance to LEED Silver standards with
       appropriate City inspections (at Applicant’s expense); and
6)     If the Applicant does not accept the proposed ordinance in writing prior
       to second reading of the ordinance, and within 30 days of the Council’s
       adoption, the question of the appropriate zoning of the Alma Plaza site
       shall be referred to the Planning and Transportation Commission for
       the consideration and recommendation, which may include the CN
       zone, the CN zone plus various overlays, a newly crafted zone
