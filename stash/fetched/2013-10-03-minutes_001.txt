ACTION ITEMS

1.     Continued Discussion of Palo Alto Transportation Demand Management
       Plan (Continued from September 16, 2013).

Mayor Scharff reported that he and Council Member Klein discussed the topic
as directed in the Motion made on September 16, 2013.

Council Member Klein recalled that the Council continued the prior Motion
and Substitute Motion to allow the Mayor and him to propose a compromise
of the two. The current proposed Motion included elements of both the
Motion and Substitute Motion. The Mayor and he wanted the City Attorney's
opinion as to the legality of Transportation Demand Management (TDM)
Districts and the process for creating them.

MOTION: Council Member Klein moved, seconded by Mayor Scharff that:
In order for the City Council to determine whether one or more
Transportation Demand Management (TDM) Districts as proposed on the
Colleaguesâ€™ memorandum or as reasonably modified would be legal,
effective, practical and economic for any or all of the University Avenue,
California Avenue, East Meadow Circle and Stanford Research            Park
Business District, the City Council hereby directs the City Manager and the
City Attorney as follows:
