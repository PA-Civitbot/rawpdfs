                         TRANSCRIPT
Mayor Burt: Yes.

Mr. Keene: I'm not a Council Member, but just speaking to the Council since
this is our last public opportunity. I just wanted to say as City Manager that
Council Member Schmid, Mayor Burt, you're the last two Council Members
from the Council who hired me. I remember you interviewed the candidates
on Father's Day. I've pointed that out before. That should have been a
signal and a warning to me, on a Sunday, Father's Day. I would just echo
what has been said, that the Council Members, you're citizen volunteers, the
amount of work that you do and the wellbeing of the community, not just
the current community but the past and the future. It's been an honor to
work as your City Manager with you. I really wish you both the best where
you go on from now as far as helping make Palo Alto a better place and
other roles. It's hard to believe. Thanks.

Mayor Burt: Thanks. The pleasure's been ours.
