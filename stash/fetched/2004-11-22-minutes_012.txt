Mayor Beecham asked if processed material kept the same value in the Single
Stream processing as in source separation.

Mr. Roberts said the value remained the same.

Mayor Beecham asked how that differed from glass-contaminated material
being less valuable.

Mr. Roberts said that was part of the 5 percent degradation but not an
overwhelming shift in the total value of product.

Mayor Beecham asked whether recyclers paid the same for Single Stream
recycled materials as they would for source-separated raw materials.

Mr. Roberts said yes.

Mayor Beecham said he would support the motion.

MOTION PASSED 6-3, Cordell, Freeman, Kishimoto no.

CONSENT CALENDAR

MOTION: Council Member Morton moved, seconded by Mossar, to approve
Item No. 2A and Consent Calendar Item Nos. 3-6.

Council Member Freeman asked to confirm the first reading vote for Item 2A on
November 8, 2004.

City Clerk Donna Rogers said the vote was 9-0.

Council Members Mossar and Ojakian stated they would not participate in Item
No. 5 due to a conflict of interest because of family holdings in
telecommunications stock.

Council Member Morton said the City Attorney verified the barrier for non-
participation was at the level of $25,000. He owned Comcast stock, which was
significantly below the barrier level and would participate.

City Attorney Gary Baum clarified under California Code Regulations 18705.1
(b) 2, as long as the ownership was less than $25,000, Council Members could
participate.

Council Member Mossar said she was employed by the Media Center, and chose
not to participate and wanted to continue to not participate in any of the issues.
