Council Member Morton said staff would be requested to return with
comments on the feasibility of opening some of the Foothills Park trails.

Council Member Mossar said the trail alignments provided connectivity from
the Bay to the ridgeline and from Santa Clara into San Mateo County.

Council Member Morton questioned whether the trail connectivity was
pedestrian and equestrian.

Council Member Mossar said it was pedestrian connectivity.

Herb Borock, P.O. Box 632, said agendas had not indicated that funds

the agenda.

Council Member Freeman asked whether the “residents only” admission
policy for Foothills Park would be discussed on future agendas.

Council Member Mossar confirmed.
