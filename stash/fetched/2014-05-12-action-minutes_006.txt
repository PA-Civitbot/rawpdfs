10.   Policy and Services Committee Recommendation to Council on Moving
      Agreements with Avenidas and Palo Alto Community Child Care out of
      the Human Services Resources Allocation Process.

MOTION: Council Member Price moved, seconded by Council Member Klein
to direct Staff to separate the funding contracts with Avenidas and Palo Alto
Community Child Care (PACCC) from the Human Services Resource
Allocation Process (HSRAP) and to contract directly with them.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION: Council Member Holman moved, seconded by
Council Member Schmid to keep Avenidas and Palo Alto Community Child
Care (PACCC) in the Human Services Resource Allocation Process.

INCORPORATED INTO THE SUBSTITUTE MOTION WITH THE
CONSENT OF THE MAKER AND SECONDER to add the HRC
recommendations identified on Packet Page 274; 1) Avenidas and PACCC will
be assured that their HSRAP funding will not be cut in order to fund
reallocations to other HSRAP grantees, 2) When the Council determines
annual adjustments to reflect the increased costs of doing business in the
nonprofit sector, Avenidas and PACCC will be assured their proportional
shares, 3) When the Council makes an incremental allocation over and
above any annual adjustment, the HRC will recommend redistribution of
those funds according to its assessment of human service needs at that
time. Incremental allocations will be recommended according to a review
covering all HSRAP recipients (including Avenidas and PACCC) and new
applicants, and 4) In the case of budget reductions set by the Council and
staff, Avenidas and PACCC will bear their proportional share, but no more, in
the HRCâ€™S recommendations.
