PUBLIC HEARING

4.    Public Hearing: The Palo Alto City Council will Consider a Request by Alex
      Kanellakos on Behalf of the Property Owners on Allen Court, Tract #
      1137, for a Zone Change from R-1 Single Family Residential to R-1(S)
      Single Family Residential with Single Story Overlay. Environmental
      Assessment: Exempt from the California Environmental Quality Act per
      Section 15301. File No. [04-ZC-07].

      Ordinance 1st Reading entitled “Ordinance of the Council of the City of
      Palo Alto Amending Section 18.08.040 of the Palo Alto Municipal Code
      (the Zoning Map) to Change the Classification of Certain Properties on
      Allen Court, a Portion of that Property Known as Tract 1137 From R-1 To
      R-1(S)”

Chief Planning Official Lisa Grote narrated a presentation outlined in staff
report (CMR:442:04)

Planning and Transportation Commissioner Karen Holman said the staff report
and staff presentation represented the actions of the Planning Commission.

Mayor Beecham declared the Public Hearing opened at 8 p.m.

Robin D. Stavisky, 3162 Ross Road, said the “overwhelming majority” level of
support was a misstatement and he felt the number of residents in favor of the
overlay was less. She wanted Council to know the majority of residents at
Allen Court were not in support and raised issues on how people felt and the
way votes were recorded.

John Sessoms, 421 Carolan Lane, said adding a second floor to an Eichler
home would take away the privacy from an existing neighbor.

John Tumminaro, 777 Allen Court, opposed the overlay and the Conditions,
Covenants and Restrictions (CC&Rs). He urged Council to not approve the
recommendations.

R. A. Witt, 769 Allen Court, did not support the overlay.

Steve Greenbaum, 782 Allen Court, was in favor of the overlay.
