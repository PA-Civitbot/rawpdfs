the power or right to unduly influence the Board or Commission Members
covered language proposed in the Amendment.

Council Member Holman felt the Amendment language was somewhat
different. The Liaison's role was not to participate fully in the discussion.

Council Member Schmid inquired whether the Amendment language would
be added at the beginning or end of Subsection C.

Council Member Holman replied at the end of Subsection C.

Council Member Schmid indicated the language would fit better in
Subsection D.

MOTION: Council Member Klein moved, seconded by Mayor Scharff to call
the question.

MOTION PASSED: 7-2 Berman, Kniss no

AMENDMENT TO MOTION PASSED: 6-3 Berman, Klein, Price no

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER in section H1 “it is appropriate for the Council
Liaison to offer as examples the following at Boards and Commissions
meetings stating existing Council policies, institutional memory, background,
procedural guidance on the scope of what is appropriate to provide to
Council and consider whether the body has the tools it needs to fulfill its
role.”

Council Member Klein felt policy guidelines were the same as advocating a
position.

Council Member Holman clarified that the Liaison's role was to represent the
policy.  The intention was to clarify Council policy for a Board or
Commission.

Council Member Klein believed that was covered by institutional memory.

Council Member Holman noted institutional memory was part of the
Amendment.

Council Member Klein indicated the Liaison could report the Council's
previous actions, including policy guidelines which would remove the
effectiveness of the whole proposal.
