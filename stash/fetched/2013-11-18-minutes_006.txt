Molly Stump, City Attorney, reported the effective date of an Ordinance was
31 days after the second reading. Construction should not proceed until that
period of time passed. Any construction that did occur prior to the effective
date was at the developer's own risk.

James Keene, City Manager, felt the City Attorney responded to Council
Member Schmid's question.       Staff could not further elucidate the
miscommunication. At the current time, Staff did not have a resolution as to
the allegations.

Council Member Schmid registered a no vote on Agenda Item Number 7.

MOTION: Vice Mayor Shepherd moved, seconded by Council Member Kniss
to approve Agenda Item Numbers 3-15.
