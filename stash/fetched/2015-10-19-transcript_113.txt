Mayor Holman: Council Member DuBois.

Council Member DuBois: We had the second meeting of the Water Recycling
Commission. We agreed to invite other Palo Alto water customers to
participate. We're also starting to look at projects that that group would
fund, as a very early look at some options there.

Mayor Holman: Seeing no other lights, this meeting is adjourned.

Adjournment: The meeting was adjourned at 11:50 P.M.
