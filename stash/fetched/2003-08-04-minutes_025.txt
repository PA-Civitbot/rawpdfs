Director of Planning and Community Development Steve Emslie said the
P&TC date could be moved up to late September.

Ms. Harrison said it would be dependent on the Council deciding on that
long-term option.

MOTION: Council Member Burch moved that the Council proceed to convert
four tennis courts into basketball courts and look for alternative places for
tennis courts

MOTION FAILED FOR LACK OF SECOND

Council Member Kleinberg wanted clarification of the definition of “burden”
when used in the phrase where parks were traditional public forums and the
public must have unrestricted public access and cannot be burdened the
right to the access.

Ms. Ancel answered the content must be neutral and narrowly tailored in the
approach and believed the public “must” or are “required” to register would
be narrowly tailored enough for the issues.

Ms. Furth said she believed the PAUSD criteria for using a sign-in system
would not be accepted by the court in regard to the traditional use of a park.

Council Member Kleinberg asked if the language regarding the burden
attached to the sign-in requirement was worrisome.

Ms. Furth said public policy favored safeguarding children in schools. She
said she believed the courts would be reasonable to the efforts to forward
the goals.

Council Member Kleinberg said the PAUSD would like to have the authority
to remove the public who were not authorized.

Ms. Ancel said the school could deny or revoke registration and therefore it
was worrisome to the City Attorney’s Office.

Council Member Kleinberg asked if the school district wanted to put a
monitoring procedure that would deter offensive individuals. She asked if
there were a way to make signage more voluntary.

Ms. Furth said the language in the staff report was language the attorney’s
office was comfortable with.
