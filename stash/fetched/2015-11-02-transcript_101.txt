came here. Google, Apple, and so on. In 1975, there were two Silicon
Valley information tech companies in the Fortune 500. They were both in
Palo Alto. Silicon Valley took off. By 2015, there are 19 Silicon Valley tech
companies in the Fortune 500. There's only one in Palo Alto. Palo Alto has
done very well for itself and for Silicon Valley to say, "We are different.
We're a place where things can start, where collaboration, where risk-taking,
where people meet and talk with each other. A residential community of
people who live here and can spend 24/7 interacting with each other." It's a
unique role for a city. To remain at the heart of Silicon Valley, having that
open space between Stanford and valley firms has been enormously
successful for us. Program L-8 is the attempt to carry that into our Comp
Plan. I'd like to make a motion saying that as a variation on L-8, we ask
Staff to go and look at growth over the next 15 years Citywide,
nonresidential between boundaries 750,000 to 1.275 million.            Those
numbers are consistent with the rates of growth we've had over the last 15,
16 years that have been monitored by the Staff. It's keeping a modest
level. The goal, at the same time, would be to reduce that jobs to employed
resident balance back to where it was in 2000, from 2.9 back towards 2.4.

Mayor Holman: You need to ...

Council Member DuBois: I would second.

Mayor Holman:     You need to restate the motion please or get some
language to David please.

Vice Mayor Schmid: Direct Staff to look at boundaries of growth for the
DEIR scenarios over the next 15 years of growth of 750,000 square feet of
nonresidential space Citywide to let's call it 1.3 million. Those are annual
growth rates between 50 and 87,000 square feet per year.

Mayor Holman:         Council Member DuBois, you seconded.          With this
clarification, are you good with that?

Council Member DuBois: Yep.

MOTION: Vice Mayor Schmid moved, seconded by Council Member DuBois
to direct Staff to look at boundaries of growth of the Draft Environmental
Impact Report (DEIR) scenarios over the next 15 years, growth of 750,000
square feet of non-residential citywide to 1.3 million square feet.

Council Member DuBois: Can you explain the higher numbers?               What's
remaining, is that the current cap?
