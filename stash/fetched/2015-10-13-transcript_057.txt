Council Member Filseth: It's probably a lot more actually. If you calculate
the rest of the county.

Council Member Scharff: Right. Most of these grade separations are
actually here and then some other places.

Mr. Keene: You were talking about Caltrain grade separation?

Council Member Scharff: Yeah, Caltrain grade separation.

Council Member Berman: I'll second.

Mayor Holman: Council Member Scharff, did you say 700 or 750?

Council Member Scharff: I said 750 would ...

Mayor Holman: 750 million. Actually I think I heard Council Member DuBois
on the left, I think I heard you second it first.

MOTION: Council Member Scharff moved, seconded by Council Member
DuBois to:

A.   Direct Staff to advocate for and support putting in the Countywide
     funding measure, funding for countywide Caltrain grade separation in
     the order of $750 million; and

B.   To check in with Council when the Measure starts to take shape.

Mayor Holman: Do you want to speak to your motion?

Council Member Scharff: The other part of that would be to check in with us
when the measure starts to take shape and then to come back to Council.

Mayor Holman:    Council Member DuBois, do you want to speak to your
second?

Council Member DuBois: Yes. I think these things are done based on
estimated sales tax.       I was going to propose that something like
approximately 15 percent of the thing be spent on grade seps, which would
be 900 million as a starting point. I'm expecting that to go down. Yeah, 15
percent with San Mateo County. I think doing it as a percentage is just a
little clearer.

Council Member Scharff: I'm good with doing it as a percentage. I think
that may actually be better.
