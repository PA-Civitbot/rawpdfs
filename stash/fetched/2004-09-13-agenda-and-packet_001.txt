                          MEMORANDUM

To:          Council Colleagues
From:        Mayor Bern Beecham, Council Member Dena Mossar
Date:        September 13, 2004
Subject:     Proposed Public-Private Partnership for Renovation of Lytton Plaza




We have been approached by Le Levy and Roxy Rapp with a proposal to
establish a private-public partnership for the purpose of redeveloping Lytton
Plaza in conformance with the 1997 Downtown Urban Design Improvements
Plan. The improvements plan envisions the use of water, greenery and seating to
make the plaza more inviting as a focus for the downtown and a place of “quiet
rest, informal gathering and small-scale entertainment.”

Initial cost estimates for the project proposed by Mr. Levy and Mr. Rapp total
$500,000. They have indicated they believe half the cost of the improvements
can be raised by the private sector and would like a commitment from the City for
matching funding.

The City Council adopted a public-private partnership policy in April 1994. The
policy includes facilitation of proposals through the City regulatory process and
consideration of waiving development-related fees. As we know, private-public
partnerships have been successfully used in the past in connection with
improvements to the Children’s Theatre and the Junior Museum and Zoo.

We ask your support to direct staff to review the proposal for Lytton Plaza and to
bring a recommendation back to the Council. Specifically, we would like the staff
to return with:
• Verification of cost estimates
• Recommendation on potential funding options
• Possible implementation timeline, including staff and board and commission
    review process
