13.   Recommendation for One-Time Additional Allocation in the Amount of
      $250,000 Over Two Years in Support of Intensive Case Management in
      Connection with Housing Subsidies to be Provided by the County of
      Santa Clara for Palo Alto’s Homeless

MOTION: Council Member Kniss moved, seconded by Council Member Price
to approve a one-time City allocation of $250,000 to be disbursed over two
years for support of its homeless outreach and placement plan and that the
Fiscal Year 2014 allocation in the amount of $125,000 is authorized to be
paid from the City Council Contingency due to the urgency of providing this
service. The homeless outreach and placement plan will be comprised of
intensive case management in connection with housing subsidies for the
homeless to be provided by the County of Santa Clara (County). Further,
the City Council directs staff to bring forward a Budget Amendment
Ordinance in November to increase the City Council Contingency in the
amount of $125,000 with a corresponding decrease of the General Fund
Budget Stabilization Reserve and include funding of the Fiscal Year 2015
allocation in the amount of $125,000 in the FY 2015 Proposed Budget.

Member Holman to remove the words “one-time,” changing the Motion to
