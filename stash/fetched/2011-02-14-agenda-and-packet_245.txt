                                                                                                               10.d

 2   Mr. Rodriguez: Yes, if we were looking at those types of land use changes it would be a much
 3   different study than we have done today. We would have much more volume along the street. A
 4   typical example, and I will ask Bret to correct me any time I say anything wrong, but a typical




                                                                                                                      Attachment: Attachment D: P&TC Excerpt Minutes of January 12, 2011 (1320 : California Avenue Neg Dec and CIP)
 5   residential unit is about ten trips average per day. That is a couple in the morning, people going
 6   to work, there are maybe a couple of mid-afternoon trips, then another couple of trips coming
 7   home in the evening. So when we do that analysis, you mentioned a 150 room hotel, we would
 8   look anywhere between say – I am just going to throw a number out, 125 trips during a peak
 9   hour. So if you look at the volumes that we were showing on our slide and you added 150
10   during those peaks you might see the Level of Service drop from B to probably a C, but you
11   probably still won’t get anywhere near a D or an E, anything that would be by CEQA considered
12   a significant impact.

14   Commissioner Garber: Thank you.
15
16   Mr. Rodriguez: I want to clarify also for the Performing Arts Center if that type of analysis were
17   to be conducted we would actually look at the periods when the events would likely be
18   occurring, and conduct more data during those planned times. So a Performing Arts Center may
19   not see an impact during say the lunch hour but you would definitely have an increase during the
20   PM peak period or later say to the seven o’clock time when activities are occurring. So I would
21   say a Performing Arts Center would have less of an impact than say a hotel that would have
22   traffic all day long.
23
24   Commissioner Garber: Thank you. What I am hearing here is just in this little mind experiment
25   that we have done is that even though there would be significant impacts they would likely be
26   less than significant relative to the conclusions that the current CEQA study has presented to us.
27
28   Mr. Rodriguez: That is correct.
29
30   Commissioner Garber: Thank you.
31
32   Chair Tuma: I want to ask a follow up to that before we go onto the next Commissioner. A little
33   slightly more concrete and less abstract, we are concurrently reviewing California Avenue Area
34   Plan that has sort of three different levels of intensity if you will, status quo, more, and then more
35   than that. Has Staff done any thinking about or analysis with respect to whether, along the same
36   lines of what Commissioner Garber was asking, whether at the most intense of those
37   developments whether that would create again the same question, something greater than a
38   significant impact for CEQA purposes? Again, I know it is a bit of an unfair question but it is
39   something that we are all studying and looking at now. So I think we want to address it at this
40   stage.
41
42   Mr. Williams: Actually, I don’t think it is an unfair question. I think it is a very fair question
43   and it is something that we talked about pretty extensively. There is a paragraph at the bottom of
44   page 7 of the Staff Report that talks about it and gives two examples, California Avenue and
45   Birch Street, and California Avenue and Ash. Sort of what would it take to actually reach a
46   Level of Service D, which is theoretically acceptable. We would prefer not to go there at those
