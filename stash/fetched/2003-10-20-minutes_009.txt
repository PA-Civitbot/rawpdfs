Council Member Freeman asked about the 2003/2004 fiscal year
Compensation Plan in which Council Appointed Officers were authorized to
give up to 3 percent of salary plus benefits for Management and Professional
positions.

Mr. Benest said there was not a base salary increase for the Management
and Professionals, but they were eligible for the Variable Management
Compensation Plan, which was a performance-based budget.

Council Member Freeman asked if it could be called a bonus.

Mr. Benest answered it could be called a performance based bonus.

Council Member Freeman asked if it could be up to 3 percent.

Mr. Benest said the 3 percent was the total available for all the employees.

Council Member Freeman queried 3 percent of what.

Mr. Benest answered 3 percent of the salary and benefits available for
performance-based budget.

Council Member Freeman asked if it was 3 percent of the pool of salaries
plus benefits.

Mr. Benest replied yes.

Council Member Freeman said she did not understand the difference.

Mr. Benest explained there was a 3 percent pool available for performance-
based bonuses called Variable Management Compensation. It had been in
practice in the City of Palo Alto for over 20 years.

Council Member Freeman said there was a potential for salary increase if
bonuses were included as part of the whole compensation package.

Mr. Benest said based on performance, an individual employee may get a
performance-based bonus.

Council Member Freeman said the City Managerâ€™s Report (CMR:449:03) gave
the impression there was not a change. She asked if that were the proper
time to speak about the housing fee allowance.

Mayor Mossar said the item on the agenda was the resolution.
