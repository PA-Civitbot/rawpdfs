California Avenue Lane Reduction – Traffic Analysis Report


Intersection Level of Service
The results of the intersection level of service analysis under project conditions are
summarized in Table 7. The results indicate that, with the proposed reduction in travel lanes,




                                                                                                                         Attachment: Attachment B: Hexagon - Cal Av TIA Report (No Appendices) (1320 : California Avenue Neg Dec and CIP)
all of the study intersections would continue to operate at acceptable levels of service with
LOS C or better. The stop sign intersections would operate at LOS A or B. While some
intersection delays would increase slightly, each of the study intersections would continue to
operate well within capacity. Thus, the proposed project would not result in any adverse LOS
impacts to intersections on California Avenue. The level of service calculation sheets are
included in Appendix B.

Roadway Segment Level of Service
Roadway links were analyzed using volume to capacity (V/C) ratios. With the proposed lane
reduction, the volume of traffic on California Avenue would remain unchanged, but the
capacity of each direction would be reduced from 1,360 vehicles per hour to 560 vehicles per
hour. According to the publication Parking by Weant and Levinson, lane groups with 2 lanes
experience a 15% reduction in capacity when on-street parking is provided and parking
turnover is heavy (approximately 40 parking maneuvers per hour). For one lane streets, on-
street parking, and heavy parking turnover, a 30% decrease in capacity is expected. The
additional reduction in capacity occurs for one lane roadways because vehicles backing out of
spaces block the entire traveled way. With the two lane configuration, through traffic can
maneuver around vehicles backing out of spaces.
