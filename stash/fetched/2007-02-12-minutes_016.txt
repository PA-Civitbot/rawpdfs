Ms. Harrison said each individual would need to make their own decision and
the Council and staff would need to understand the individual’s situation.

Mayor Kishimoto said the notification process needed to be defined to ease
the community’s anxiety and emphasized the need of having a warning
system. She asked whether staff would be responding to PAN’s request for
budgetary support and recognition within the CCC’s framework.

Ms. Harrison said the RRTF would need to fully examine the CCC’s
involvement and accountability prior to making decisions. Staff and PAN
endorsed having block captains.

Mayor Kishimoto said attention needed to be given to the coordination
process to aid in minimizing confusion.

Ms. Harrison said staff had made a decision to use a steering committee with
a work support group to maximize department participation. There were
numerous groups with common themes such as the Neighborhood Watch
and Police Academy Graduates that could come together to strengthen
coordination.

Council Member Kleinberg said in moving forward it would help to define the
roles and responsibilities of all non-official participants.

Mayor Kishimoto said in terms of corporations’ roles, Roche would be giving
a presentation on their preparedness and sustainability programs during a
Study Session on February 28, 2007.

Council Member Morton expressed the need for a small business emergency
response plan and to include coordination with the private-sector, business
community, and large employers such as the Stanford Industrial Park,
Stanford Shopping Center, Palo Alto Medical Foundation and Stanford
Hospital.

Council Member Kleinberg said all sectors mentioned were included in the
RRTF and would not be overlooked.

Vice Mayor Klein said citizens would view the Emergency Management
Operations Plan as a guide to what happens in the event of an emergency
