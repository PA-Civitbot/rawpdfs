Mayor Burt: Council Member Berman.

Council Member Berman: Following up on that. On the chart on Packet
Page 139, it says there are 72 employee daily permits issued. That's over
how long of a time?

Ms. Atkinson: I don't think we have the page numbers in here. Could you
be more specific?

Council Member Berman: Page 4 of the Staff Report. It's the 72 employee
daily.

Ms. Atkinson:   That's since the beginning of Phase 2.   They're not used
widely.

Council Member Berman: Which is like a couple a day at most.

Ms. Atkinson: Yes.

Council Member Berman: Thanks.

Ms. Atkinson: The five day permit that was introduced hasn't been utilized
at all. Food for thought for moving into the permit program.

Council Member Berman: It doesn't show up on the bar graph.

Ms. Atkinson: It's zero.

Council Member Berman: Thanks.

Mayor Burt: Council Member Schmid, did you have a final follow-up?

Council Member Schmid: Yeah, just a follow-up. The question was raised
where is the two hour parking. On the supplemental Packet Page 314, isn't
that what that is? Those are the two hour parking, and it shows very
concentrated.

Mr. Mello: Could you reference an exhibit number or an attachment? We
don't have page numbers in our Packet.

Council Member Schmid: It's the supplemental Packet that was given this
Thursday. The only Page I have on it is 314, Attachment F.

Ms. Atkinson: That is the total occupancy of those who are parking with no
permit. Yes, that does represent the people who are parking with no permit.
