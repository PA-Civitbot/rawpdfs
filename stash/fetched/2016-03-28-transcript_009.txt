provision in the agreement that it is available to the community. There are
some functions that are fee-based, and the City would receive those fees.

Council Member DuBois: Do we have any idea what the fee would be?

Mr. Perez: It's minimal. We'll email it out to you.

Council Member DuBois: It'd be on the lower range of like the community
centers?

Mr. Perez: Yeah. It's a small room, too; it's not a very large meeting room
itself.

Council Member DuBois: If it's okay, I'd like to go ahead and move the Staff
Motion.

Council Member Kniss: Second.

MOTION: Council Member DuBois moved, seconded by Council Member
Kniss to authorize the City Manager or his designee to execute a four-year
lease agreement between the Palo Alto Lawn Bowls Club, Inc. and the City of
Palo Alto for the Palo Alto Lawn Bowl facility at 474 Embarcadero Road with
two, three-year extension terms for a total not to exceed term of ten years.

Mayor Burt: Did you wish to speak to it?

Council Member DuBois: No.

Mayor Burt: Council Member Kniss, did you want to ...

Council Member Kniss: (inaudible).

Mayor Burt: Council Member Berman.

Council Member Berman: The one quick suggestion I was going to make is
also if you're not already, you look at marketing on Nextdoor.com which is a
website that a lot of the neighborhoods use, that I know a lot of folks look at
every day, the posts that come up. It's a couple years old, but a good kind
of source for that.

Mr. Hickson: Thank you. May I just add one thing? As the head coach, if
any of you'd like to come down and see us in operation, we would be happy
to give you some instruction.

Council Member Berman: Do you have to wear whites?
