Mike Nolan: Thanks. I've lived in Midtown since 1979. I just want to point
out that I want to thank the Midtown Residents Association, I guess, in
general for being there and Sheri specifically for being there. Having her
and that group there really adds to the quality of our life in Midtown and
helps maintain some sort of fabric there. Thank you, Sheri. I really
appreciate your service. I guess I alsoâ€”iterating what Annette said, I'd like
to say I appreciate you folks for recognizing Sheri and by that recognizing
the importance of these community organizations and these networks of
citizens in the various neighborhoods. It's really important to us. It's
important to maintain that fabric of what I've come to think of as Palo Alto.
I know there's differences of opinion about ways things should be done. The
fact that you're here and willing to listen to these groups and to citizens like
myself, I really appreciate it. Thank you, and thanks, Sheri. Thanks a lot.
