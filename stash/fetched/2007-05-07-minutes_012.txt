15.   Transmittal of Police Auditor Interim Report

Council Member Cordell stated in March 2006 the Council approved a one-
year contract for a Police Auditor. In August, the OIR Group was retained,
and prepared a semi-annual report. She stated the decision to have a Police
Auditor is one of the wisest decisions the Council has made.

MOTION: Council Member Cordell moved, seconded by Klein, to accept the
interim report as provided by the Police Auditors Michael Gennaco and
Robert Miller, dated May 7, 2007.

Aram James stated the independent Police Auditor has done a great job
reaching out to members of the Police Department, working with the policy
and procedures manual and important internal considerations. However, the
Police Auditor has not reached out to the community to explain the function
of the independent Police Auditors. He did not agree with the presentation of
the Taser Task Force and felt it was one-sided.

Mayor Kishimoto stated she appreciated the policy and procedure changes
that the Police Auditor recommended.

MOTION PASSED        9-0.

Council Member Cordell asked whether staff would come back with
recommendations regarding whether the Police Auditorâ€™s jurisdiction would
extend to SEIU employees.

City Attorney Gary Baum responded yes and asked to have staff return with
a recommendation regarding this inclusion in the policy.

REPORTS OF COMMITTEES AND COMMISSIONS

Mayor Kishimoto noted Agenda Item Nos. 18 and 19 would be heard
together.

Mr. Benest suggested the Taser Task Force Chair make a presentation and
then Chief Johnson would make a presentation regarding number 19.
