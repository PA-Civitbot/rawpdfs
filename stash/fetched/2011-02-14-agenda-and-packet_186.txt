The basis of the analysis is as follows: (1) the Poisson probability distribution is used to
estimate the 95th percentile maximum number of queued vehicles per signal cycle for a
particular movement; (2) the estimated maximum number of vehicles in the queue is
translated into a queue length, assuming 25 feet per vehicle; and (3) the estimated

maximum queue length is compared to the existing or planned available storage capacity
for the movement.

Report Organization
The remainder of this report is divided into four chapters. Chapter 2 describes the existing
transportation system including the roadway network, transit service, and existing bicycle
and pedestrian facilities. Chapter 3 describes the impact of the proposed project on the
transportation system. Chapter 4 presents the conclusions and recommendations of the
transportation analysis.
