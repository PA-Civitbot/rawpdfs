Ms. Shen replied no. Ms. Peckham has done a number of City Clerk
recruitments and has a good idea of the market. All four of the recruiters
have been informally spoken to about this recruitment.

Mayor Shepherd inquired as to her sphere of knowledge.

Ms. Shen stated that Ms. Peckham has worked throughout the State of
California.

Mayor Shepherd asked for names of other cities that Ms. Peckham had
recruited for.

Ms. Shen stated that when they submit their proposal they will include
recent recruitments they have completed. The packet will also include
sample brochures.

Mayor Shepherd confirmed they are asking all four recruiters to submit
proposals.

Ms. Shen replied yes.

MOTION: Mayor Shepherd moved, seconded by Vice Mayor Kniss to seek
Request for Proposals for the City Clerk recruitment from a professional
recruiter, to include the four already spoken to.

Council Member Klein inquired why Ms. Shen was limiting to the four
recruiters.

Ms. Shen stated that because this would be under $25,000 it would be an
informal bid and normally they only seek three bidders. However, we are
looking at these four.

MOTION PASSED: 4-0

Chair Scharff inquired as to the timing of the process.

Ms. Shen advised that she would return within a week with information from
the recruiters.

Mayor Shepherd wanted to be sure of what the stages are for the
recruitment.
