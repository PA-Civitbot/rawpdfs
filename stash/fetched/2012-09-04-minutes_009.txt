                                MINUTES
September 19, 2012, then the Item would return to the Council at the next
Council meeting.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION: Council Member Klein moved, seconded by Council
Member Holman to continue this item to September 10, 2012.

Council Member Holman requested Staff provide information regarding the
process for a soft appeal when the Item returned to the Council Agenda.

Ms. Stump agreed to provide information; however, soft appeal was not a
technical term.

Council Member Holman understood.

Council Member Schmid reiterated that the discussion of the Housing
Element for 2007-2014 noted the ABAG numbers had been dramatically
overstated. During that discussion, the Committee received a legal opinion
that it was too late to file an appeal for that time period. There was a period
of time when the right of appeal expired; therefore, it was important to
identify that time period.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION PASSED: 8-0 Espinosa absent
