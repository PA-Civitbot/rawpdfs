      District Number 40. The Council shall hear all protests and receive
      evidence for and against the action herein proposed, and when and
      where the Council shall consider and finally determine whether the
      public necessity, health and safety require the establishment of the
      District and the removal of poles, overhead wires, and associated
      overhead structures, and the underground installation of wires and
      facilities for supplying electric, communication and similar or
      associated services in the District.

 Electric Engineering Manager Tomm Marshall said he had received a few
 comments from the public. There were 16 homes that were being
 considered in the Underground District.

 Mayor Beecham declared the Public Hearing open at 7:10 p.m.

 offered by the City as an accommodation for loss of property and
 landscaping in connection with the levy restoration and floodwall
 reconstruction project on the San Francisquito Creek.
