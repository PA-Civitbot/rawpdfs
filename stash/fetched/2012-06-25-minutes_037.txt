Mr. Marshall indicated it depended on location, but typically no.

Mayor Yeh said the Staff recommendation in the presentation was slightly
different from the recommendation in the Staff report.

Council Member Shepherd inquired if the difference was the requirement for
Staff to return to the Council in six months.

Mayor Yeh stated that would be a fourth recommendation.             It was not
included in the Staff report.

Council Member Shepherd wanted to include that recommendation.

Council Member Holman inquired whether six months was the earliest Staff
could return.

Mr. Williams answered yes.

Council Member Holman asked whether equipment shelters were assumed to
be part of the description in Recommendation 1.

Mr.     Williams suggested   substituting   "for   a   City-wide  wireless
communications network" for "towers and antennas." That would include
any and all components. Alternatively, the Council could add "and ancillary
facilities."

Council Member Holman asked if Staff's report would provide options to
eliminate or rollback incentives for DAS.

Mr. Williams indicated Staff would return with options for incentives and
disincentives.

Council Member Burt did not find a correlation between the Staff report and
the Motion. He asked Staff to explain how the Staff recommendations
aligned with the list of community priorities for an RFP versus the
information before the Council.

Mr. Williams stated the recommendation was too narrowly framed after the
discussion tonight.    The recommendation should be to initiate an RFP
process for a City-wide wireless communications network.
