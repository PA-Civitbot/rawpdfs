Council Member Barton raised concerns regarding the Home Energy Rating
System (HERS) requirement. He said Staff could recommend not to pursue
the HERS requirement if they did not find it useful. He felt the 50 Green
Points was low and suggested taking a closer look at it to research ways that
would help homeowners and architects get the 50 Green Points quickly. He
supported Staff’s recommendation.

Council Member Klein raised concerns regarding the City completing the
verification and asked what it was called when the City did the verification.

Ms. Heinen said Staff would work closely with the City Attorney’s Office for
the appropriate language.

Council Member Klein asked whether the Leadership in Energy and
Environmental Design (LEED) standard was used in judging.

Ms. Heinen said yes and the City would use the same exact submittal
process in reviewing the process.

Council Member Klein asked how LEED felt about using their standards and
not their name.

Ms. Heinen said LEED had not responded. Building It Green was local and
was more involved in the process changes. Their main concern was to collect
information on a statewide basis on how Green Building was doing and
environmental indicators.

Council Member Klein asked whether any of the commercial buildings chose
to use the Palo Alto process.

Ms. Heinen said yes. Large commercial innovations had the option under
the old Ordinance. She found that on the non-residential side they were
open to the City’s verification due to the time and cost of going through the
US Green Building Council (USGBC) process. On the residential side, more
people would want to choose Build It Green because the Building
Department could not offer it cheaper.

Council Member Klein said in terms of the Energy Code, did Staff consider
moving to a program where the City required buildings to be brought up to
higher standards.
