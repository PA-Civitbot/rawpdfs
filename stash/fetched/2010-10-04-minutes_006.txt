Council Member Scharff stated maximum house size and FAR was roughly
the same number.

Mr. Williams stated that was correct.

Council Member Scharff inquired whether the City had an impervious surface
requirement, or whether it was combined in the FAR.

Mr. Williams stated the City had an impervious surface requirement, plus a
FAR requirement. The impervious surface area was the coverage on the
ground, and the FAR was the building space. He stated the maximum house
size would be layered on top of those two requirements.

Council Member Scharff inquired whether all housing developments of this
magnitude would be reviewed by the P&TC.

Mr. Williams stated any new house would be subject to the Site and Design
Review process by the P&TC, and brought to the City Council for final design
approval.

Mayor Burt inquired on the difficultly to achieve additional Build It Green
points.

Mr. Williams stated he had seen a maximum of 180 additional Build It Green
points. He stated it was less likely for a larger house to achieve a larger
number of additional Build It Green points.

Council Member Price inquired how long the Site and Design Review process
and Build It Green requirements have been in place.

Mr. Williams stated the Site and Design Review process had been in place
since approximately 1980.       The Build It Green requirements were
established a few years ago.

Council Member Price inquired whether prior City Council Members, between
the late 1970s through 2009, had addressed this issue.

Mr. Williams stated he was unsure how far the debate went back. Part of
the Zoning Ordinance update, adopted roughly 10 years ago, discussed
maximum house size in the OS Zone District. There had been houses built
in the 2000â€™s that were concerning given their size.

Council Member Price stated the application of the proposed Ordinance
would apply to approximately 80 separate parcels.
