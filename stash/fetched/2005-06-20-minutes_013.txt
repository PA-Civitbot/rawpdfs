      B.    The Finance Committee recommends the City Council Adopt
            Sections of the Community Services and Planning Department
            2005-2006 Budgets and the 2006-2007 In-Concept Budgets as
            Modified, Pertaining to Nonprofit Entities, Including Community
            Development Block Grant (CDBG) and Human Services Resource
            Allocation Process (HSRAP) and the Ordinance Portions Related
            Thereto.

Council Member Morton would not participate in the item due to a conflict of
interest because he provided, or had provided, services to those organizations
receiving Community Development Block Grant Funds.

MOTION: Council Member Mossar moved, seconded by Ojakian, to accept the
Finance Committee recommendation to adopt sections of the Community
Services and Planning Department 2005-06 budgets and the 2006-07 in-
concept budgets as modified, pertaining to nonprofit entities, including CDBG
and HSRAP and the ordinance portions related thereto.

Council Member Mossar acknowledged the Finance Committee added back in
the additional funding for Project Sentinel so they could continue to provide
essential services for the community.

Council Member Freeman clarified the recommendation was for non-profit
entities including the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) and Human
Services Resource Allocation Process (HSRAP) funds, and was not for the
structure of the Community Services or Planning Departments.

Director of Administrative Services Carl Yeats said that was correct.
