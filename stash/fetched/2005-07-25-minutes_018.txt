Angelica Volterra, P.O. Box 1724, said approval of the MND should be denied
as it did not comply with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and
did not ensure that all significant/potentially significant project impacts were
mitigated.

Toni Stein, 800 Magnolia, Menlo Park, urged the Council not to approve the
project until proper mitigations were included. The magnitude of the project
would cause issues with the need for a signal light at Watson Court.

Georganna Hynes, 140 Azalia Drive, East Palo Alto, suggested using the site
to build a car dealership. She urged the Council to study the project further
before voting on it.

Jim Baer addressed the issue of traffic impacts. He said if trip generation was
based on an average as opposed to the curve, the difference was 110 PM
peak hour trips versus 162, which equaled less than two trips per minute and
three trips per minute respectively. In relationship to the gap analysis, there
were 221 left turn gaps, which was 2-1/2 times the number of gaps necessary
for 110 cars to exit and make the left turn, and 2 times the number for 162
cars to do the same. There were 254 right turn opportunity gaps, which was
14.9 times the number of gaps necessary to make a right turn out of Watson
Court. He believed the project had done more on a voluntary basis in meeting
the needs checklist.

Mayor Burch declared the Public Hearing closed at 9:25 p.m.

Council Member Kishimoto asked whether the flow of traffic on East Bayshore
Road was based on 2005 data or extrapolated data from 2001.

Ms. El-Guendy said the volumes on Watson Court were based on the 2005
survey. On East Bayshore Road, they were done under four analysis
scenarios: 2001 volumes; background for 2008; background plus project
including the project trips with no credit; and 2015 cumulative volumes.

Council Member Kishimoto clarified 2008 volumes were calculated on the
extrapolated 2001 data and not the actual 2005 data.

Ms. El-Guendy said that was correct. Despite that volumes had decreased
from 2001 to the present, a 1.2 compounded yearly growth rate was applied
to come up with the 2008 volumes.

Council Member Kishimoto asked for clarification of the recommendation for
ingress only on East Bayshore Road.

Mr. Emslie said staff suggested modifying the recommendation to retain East
Bayshore driveway as ingress and egress.
