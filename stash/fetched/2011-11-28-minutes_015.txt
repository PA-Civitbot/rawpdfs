railings before having the design reviewed by the various Boards and
Commissions for final approval.

Council Member Scharff said Staff was not asking Council to make any
design aspect decisions tonight.

Mr. Sartor said that was correct and he added part of the increased cost to
the Alignment D-Enhanced design was the configuration and the width of the
structure itself.

Council Member Scharff clarified Council was to accept the feasibility study
and direct Staff to proceed with going forward with the overcrossing at
Adobe Creek at a cost of $250,000.

Mr. Sartor said that was correct.

Council Member Burt asked for clarification on the differences in the widths
between the Alignment D-Enhanced design and the Ralston Avenue Bridge.

Mr. Sartor said the Alignment D-Enhanced design was at a width of 20 feet
and he did not believe the Ralston Avenue was as wide. The Alignment D-
Enhanced design had room for landing areas for viewing opportunities while
the Ralston Avenue did not.

Council Member Burt asked how critical the 20 foot width was and if Staff
could break-out the cost difference for that portion.

Mr. Sartor stated the cost estimated for the Alignment D-Standard design, at
a ten foot wide structure, was from $5 to $7 million. The Alignment D-
Enhanced design had several raised areas for pedestrians and ranged from
$7 to $10 million.

Council Member Burt said only a portion of the cost was attributed to the
width.

Mr. Sartor said that was correct and a portion of the cost was attributed to
the shape and alignment itself.

Council Member Burt asked for a breakdown of the cost for the width which
was the utilitarian and safety aspect of the bridge.

Mr. Sartor said Staff did not have that level of detail at this phase.
