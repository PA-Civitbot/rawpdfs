Mr. Morton said he was referring to the public utility access.

Ms. Furth said that it was included.

Mayor Mossar suggested an amendment to direct staff to reassess short-
term parking needs of retail businesses in the area and come up with a
parking plan that allowed for significantly more short-term in- and out-
parking for customer parking.

Ms. Furth asked if it was supplemental to any onsite parking and not in lieu
of any onsite parking.

Mayor Mossar said it was not in lieu of any onsite parking.

INCORPORATED INTO MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE MAKER
AND SECONDER to direct staff to reassess short term in/out parking needs
of retail businesses in the area and come up with a parking plan that allows
for significant additional customer parking.

Council Member Kleinberg said with added parking and sensitivity to the
needs of the retailers, it enhanced the neighborhood and gave a framework
to model higher-density housing where it was needed.

Council Member Beecham said he supported the motion for the Current
Plan. It offered added parking, housing and BMR units.

Mayor Mossar briefly summarized the list and said adequate public parking
had been addressed and additional access points of parking were also
addressed in the proposal.

Ms. Furth clarified there were multiple subterranean access points and one
surface access point.

Mr. Emslie clarified there were multiple pedestrian stairway access points
and one vehicle access point from High Street that was under debate.

Mayor Mossar said to consider eliminating and reducing retail was not
applicable to the motion; incorporating the Family Services Laundry building
was also not an applicable option. Reducing and analyzing construction
impacts was added to motion.

Council Member Ojakian assumed reducing and analyzing construction was
part of the Public Works Departmentâ€™s regular process.
