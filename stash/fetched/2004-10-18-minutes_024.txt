COUNCIL COMMENTS, QUESTIONS, AND ANNOUNCEMENTS

Council Member Morton asked City Attorney Baum to provide the Council
with guidelines on how to call for the question and if that action takes
precedence over other actions.

Mr. Baum stated Council Protocols state the action takes precedence but the
Mayor has the ultimate prerogative to run the meeting.

Mayor Beecham clarified the question was whether a colleague could call for
the question or did they have to be recognized by the Chair in order to make
that motion.

ADJOURNMENT: The meeting adjourned at 10:10 p.m.


ATTEST:                                 APPROVED:




City Clerk                              Mayor
