Council Member Questions, Comments and Announcements

Council Member Burt: I have a report out of the Caltrain Local Policymaker
Group. In lieu of taking time tonight, I've asked Staff to distribute the
presentation to the Council. If there are follow-ups subsequently, we can
discuss that.

Council Member Kniss: If any of you ever want any of the extensive Air
Board reports that deal with wood smoke among other things including tar
sands and so forth, I'd be delighted to chat with you.

Adjournment: The meeting was adjourned in memory of Palo Alto City
employee Ewing Bettles at 12:25 P.M.
