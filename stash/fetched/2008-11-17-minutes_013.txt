Vice Mayor Drekmeier stated the benefit was the creation of space for taller
vehicles, not just vehicles in general.

Mr. Williams stated this was his understanding. He stated it was shown on
the cross-section as an actual whole other space, but the intent was for the
lower spaces to accommodate tall vehicles.

Council Member Barton gave examples of the lift parking systems versus the
use of a pit system.

Council Member Morton cited the importance of this pit system versus
backing out on the street to remove cars from the structure.

Council Member Barton stated the pit system was vertical tandem parking
similar to residential two-car garages throughout the city. He stated the
applicant provided information which revealed adequate space for vehicle
parking and readjustments within the garage space.

Council Member Yeh asked if the double spots were slated to be shared by
one unit within the building.

Mr. Williams verified these double parking spots would be specific to one unit
within the structure.

Council Member Schmid stated the ground plan indicated the maneuvering
was done inside the structure. While awkward, he stated this was not a
problematic issue.

AMENDMENT FAILED: 1-8 Morton yes

Council Member Yeh indicated support for the Motion. He encouraged future
consideration of public transit use and outreach. He stressed the importance
of pedestrian traffic as well.

MOTION PASSED: 8-1 Morton no

Council took a five minute break at 10:14 p.m.
