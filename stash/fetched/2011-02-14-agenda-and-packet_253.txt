 1   The last one, and I think I am going to get it in my five minutes, is relatively new, and that is
 2   sustainability. I don’t think we could overemphasize how important not just walkability, but the
 3   climate protection goals we have, urban forest, the use of permeable materials. I think
 4   Commissioner Garber mentioned maintenance, making sure we are not replacing things all the




                                                                                                                    Attachment: Attachment D: P&TC Excerpt Minutes of January 12, 2011 (1320 : California Avenue Neg Dec and CIP)
 5   time. This is really an important newer urban design goal. I think it should be considered as we
 6   go forward with the design aspect, then beautification, and the connectivity, and the street
 7   improvements, and land use, and sustainability. They are all working together as really the urban
 8   design of California Avenue. Thank you.

10   Chair Tuma: Thank you. Commissioner Tanaka followed by Lippert.
11
12   Commissioner Tanaka: First I would like to thank Staff for the work and for winning the grant.
13   I think that is great. Thank you for all the comments from the public. I appreciate you coming
14   out this late evening.
15
16   I have a few questions for Tommy. Can Tommy go to the mike? Basically, one of the
17   comments that I heard is that a lot of the businesses were against this. I understand that you
18   actually talked to a lot of the businesses. I was wondering if you could share your experience.
19
20   Mr. Fehrenbach: With special thanks to Feta Bishop who unfortunately is not here tonight. She
21   is the President of the California Avenue Area Development Association. We were able to get
22   some businesses to attend many of the meetings, especially the last meeting that we had, as well
23   as to put the actual plans and the project in a few places along California Avenue for people to
24   come on their own time and view the plans. Basically, we received many comments via email
25   from those folks.
26
27   I talked to folks both for and against the project. I think there was nothing substantive that you
28   didn’t hear tonight in terms of the arguments for and against. I can say that I believe that Feta
29   did a great job of helping to get the merchants involved and get the information to them.
30
31   Commissioner Tanaka: Okay, great. Thank you. I don’t know if this is a question for you or for
32   Jaime, but I have read somewhere and this is probably appropriate for areas where there is
33   limited real estate like San Francisco perhaps or maybe areas where real estate is very expensive
34   like Palo Alto, that each parking space costs something like $100,000. Do you have any idea of
35   how much does a parking spot right on the street in front of a business, how much is that worth
36   generally?
37
38   Mr. Rodriguez: I would probably say that your best reference is the parking space within a
39   parking structure is a garage. So within a price range of about $40,000 to $50,000 per space that
40   is what we would probably use. I would say conservatively it is probably closer to about
41   $40,000 on the low end if you want to just go with a low number.
42
43   Commissioner Tanaka: What about if it is on the street?
44
45   Mr. Rodriguez: That is what I would assign a value to because that is what it would take to build
46   it somewhere else.
