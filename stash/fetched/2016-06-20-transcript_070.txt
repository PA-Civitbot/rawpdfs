INCORPORATED INTO THE SUBSTITUTE MOTION WITH THE
CONSENT OF THE MAKER AND SECONDER to remove from the Motion
Part B, “of where.”

SUBSTITUTE MOTION RESTATED: Vice Mayor Scharff moved, seconded
by Council Member Schmid to:

A.   Direct Staff to return with bikeway improvements along Loma Verde
     Avenue with a preference for Class 4 Bikeway improvements with clear
     indication of what signage and on street markings would be
     recommended by Staff; and

B.   Work with Santa Clara County to determine if the Santa Clara County
     grant funds can be used to create a Class 4 bike pathway along Loma
     Verde Avenue and if not, or the Loma Verde Avenue Path is
     determined to be infeasible, return to Council to use the grant money
     on Segments D, E, and F; and

C.   Return with a plan for a Caltrain crossing at Loma Verde Avenue and
     Alma Street prior to spending funds; and

D.   Adopt the Midtown Connector Feasibility Study.

Mayor Burt: I think that covers it. Please vote on the board. That passes
7-1 with Council Member DuBois voting no. Thank you all, to the Staff and
the public, for everybody's thoughtful participation.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION AS AMENDED PASSED:               7-1 DuBois no, Berman
absent

Mayor Burt: We'll take a brief five minute break, and then convene our next
item.
