Council Member Schmid stated the goal was to have the City Auditor, who
reports to the Council, be the responsible party.

Mayor Klein stated the City Manager was in charge of the day-to-day
administration of the city and if he deemed it necessary to secure a
consultant to improve the function of the government, he had the authority.
The duplication of having the City Manager and the City Auditor review was
a checks and balances system.

Council Member Yeh asked if the audit was assigned to the City Auditor’s
office what the current capacity for the office was.

Senior Auditor Renata Khoshroo stated there were two current audits in
process and two beginning. She asked whether the question of assignment
would be after the City Auditor was onboard or moving forward at present
time.

Council Member Yeh asked whether the City Auditor’s office was to oversee
an outside firm, would that be less disruptive to current staff projects.

Ms. Khoshroo stated yes, that would be more feasible.

Council Member Burt stated he did not see the need for duplication of
expense and effort between the Auditor and Managers’ office. He wanted to
be assured policies were being followed through appropriate administration.

Mr. Benest stated yes.

Council Member Espinosa asked for clarification on the Motion in reference to
the use of the City Auditor’s office.

Council Member Schmid stated it had been the responsibility of the City
Auditor to review the policies in question. He stated the incoming City
Auditor would be given the authority to contract out or maintain the project
in-house.

Mayor Klein stated contracting out was an unwarranted expense and
expressed that was the reason the city had an Auditor’s Department.

Council Member Yeh stated moving forward with an outside Auditor would be
a budget neutral event with the current salary savings of not having a City
Auditor.
