Council Member Klein noted they didn't discuss the use of sales proceeds.
Assuming the property sold for $x million, he asked where the $x million
went.

Ms. Alvarado stated it went into the general fund of the Postal Service.

Council Member Klein thought that would be one way to reduce the annual
deficit.

Ms. Alvarado answered correct.

Mr. Wigdell said this program was part of a larger program of the Postal
Service to become solvent by the year 2015 or so, and involved other
closures and consolidations and reducing deliveries.

Council Member Klein inquired if the highest bid always won.

Ms. Alvarado responded no.

Council Member Klein asked what went into that decision.

Ms. Alvarado explained the highest bidder may not always have the cash or
have acceptable credit or propose a suitable use for the property.

Council Member     Klein   inquired   if       there   was   a   discount   for   local
governments.

Ms. Alvarado suggested the City put in an offer.

Council Member Klein asked if discounts were in a written policy in the
Postal Service or if they had been carried out in actual practice.

Ms. Alvarado was not aware of any discounts.

Council Member Klein proposed the following scenario: three credible
buyers, one bid x amount and wanted to develop it into an office building,
another bid a little less than x amount and wanted to turn it into a hotel,
and the City bid half of x amount to keep the property in public use. He
asked how the Postal Service decided who won the property.

Ms. Alvarado couldn't answer that question right now.

Council Member Klein inquired how the Council could get guidance on that.

Ms. Alvarado said she had provided the name of the asset manager and
suggested the City submit a letter of intent.
