Mayor Shepherd stated that could happen.

Vice Mayor Kniss felt the Amendment should designate the City owned 8
acres.

Council Member Schmid asked what would happen to funds in the Cubberley
Reserve.

Mr. Rossmann reported the money was set aside as part of the Budget for
future allocations.  The purpose of those funds was maintenance and
infrastructure needs at Cubberley. Staff did not indicate in the Budget
document the 8 acres just mentioned.

Council Member Schmid asked if the Reserve was in the City's name and
whether the City had paid PAUSD.

Mr. Rossmann responded yes. The Reserve Fund was designated for Council
disposition for future infrastructure and maintenance needs at Cubberley.

Mr. Perez recalled that the Council directed Staff not to include the Covenant
Not to Develop in the Budget. The Council suggested that money could be
utilized for maintenance and capital improvements at Cubberley.

Council Member Schmid asked if PAUSD had requested funds.

Mr. Perez stated the answer would be coming in the next section addressed
by the City Manager.

AMENDMENT PASSED: 7-1 Schmid no, Scharff absent

Mayor Shepherd expressed concern about funding for the Golf Course. She
requested Staff comment on the City's exposure for the Golf Course.

Mr. Keene reported Staff originally believed the City would award a contract
at the beginning of May 2014 and close the Golf Course at the end of April.
Staff was handling a shortfall in funding separately.

Mr. Rossmann advised that the Council approved a Budget Amendment
Ordinance (BAO) in early May 2014 to keep the Golf Course open for the
remainder of the fiscal year.

Mr. Keene inquired whether the BAO would total $100,000.
