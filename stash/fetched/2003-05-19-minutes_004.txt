Jim Wiley, 1200 Woodland Avenue, Menlo Park, said he lived in the only
Menlo Park house in Reach 2, between Woodland Avenue and the creek.
Five years prior, a two-foot flow of water went through East Palo Alto where
the University Circle had since been built. He believed this was most of the
water that went onto Highway 101. Earlier in the year, a photo had been
taken of the water level at the Highway 101 Bridge. The water was at the
same height from the University Avenue Bridge. The model did not show
what happened at the University Avenue Bridge. He queried whether the U.
S. Army Corps of Engineers was asked for help and whether they would
need to return to the City Council for approval.

Mayor Mossar stated the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers would return to the
City Council for approval. They went back to the Joint Powers Authority
(JPA) and the JPAâ€™s member agencies.

Mr. Wiley proposed that all attention was focused on Reach 1.

Mayor Mossar said the body of work completed to date on Reach 1 would be
passed on to the Army Corps of Engineers.

No action required.

ADJOURNMENT: The meeting adjourned at 7:58 p.m.
