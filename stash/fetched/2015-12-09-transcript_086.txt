Ms. Gitelman: I think that's the same issue. I think we want to enable this
in our direct interaction between the Council and the CAC. We'll have to
agendize a subsequent item to get your actual direction, an Action Item
either that night or some night shortly thereafter.

Mayor Holman: Thank you. Clarification about the work that we did tonight.
I had a note to myself about noise.         If Staff would also have the
conversation with CAC about ambient noise. We usually talk about direct
impact noise; we don't talk that much about ambient noise. Is Staff okay
with having that conversation with the CAC?

Ms. Gitelman: That will undoubtedly be part of the conversation. There are
some pretty specific requirements in the Government Code of what the noise
section has to address. It includes a number of things that will capture
ambient noise and what our compatible land use is based on, their noise
level. We'll get into that.

Mayor Holman: Thank you. I appreciate that. Seeing no other lights, this
meeting is adjourned.

Adjournment: The meeting was adjourned at 10:05 P.M.
