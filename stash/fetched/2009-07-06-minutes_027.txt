INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH CONSENT OF THE MAKER
AND SECONDER to have volunteers translate the campaign statements in
Chinese and Spanish languages for online posting of the statements in these
languages.

Council Member Kishimoto inquired whether the language translations would
be mandated or simply volunteered.

commitment from the City Council and felt it would send a consistent
message to the community of the City Council’s inclusiveness of all
community members.

Council Member Burt felt enlisting the Website Committee or Human
Relations Commission to be the conduit for this project would be beneficial.

Council Member Kishimoto spoke on volunteer translation examples from
past years that were successful.
