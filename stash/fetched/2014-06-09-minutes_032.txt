Mr. Betts could make adjustments to the Community Garden Program;
however, the policy for a Fee Reduction Program applied to all or many
programs listed under arts and sciences programs and recreation programs.
A fee reduction applied to youth 17 years of age or under, seniors, and/or
disabled adult residents. The Fee Reduction Program was based on income.
Staff did not include able-bodied adults in the Fee Reduction Program for
arts and sciences, recreation, or community gardens. Staff would need
direction on whether the matter would be referred to the Policy and Services
Committee for discussion.

Council Member Holman inquired about a reason for the Fee Reduction
Program applying to all programs.

Mr. Betts explained that bifurcating the Fee Reduction Program between
activities would be confusing for front desk personnel.

Council Member Holman requested Staff consider the matter in 2015 for FY
2016.

Mr. Keene would have to look at the issue of fairness and consistency of
providing a discount for one program and not another.

CALL THE QUESTION: Council Member Klein moved, seconded by Council
Member Price to call the question.

Superintendant. He reviewed the terms. He had not reached an agreement
with PAUSD to eliminate the Covenant Not to Develop and the payment
under the lease.        PAUSD was open to a longer-term lease and
reconfiguration of the City's 8 acres. PAUSD suggested a reciprocal option
for the City to purchase PAUSD's 27 acres. He declined, indicating the City's
potential purchase of PAUSD's 27 acres was impractical. There did not
