Mayor Burt: Our first item tonight is a Study Session. It's a presentation
with our partner agency, Palo Alto Housing Corp. Ms. Gitelman, would you
like to kick things off?

Hillary Gitelman, Planning and Community Environment Director: I'd be
happy to. Thank you, Mayor Burt and Council Members. Hillary Gitelman,
the Planning Director. I'm here with Candace Gonzalez, the President and
Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Palo Alto Housing Corporation, and Grace
Lee, a project manager. I think you know Grace because she formerly
served on our Architectural Review Board (ARB). The City Manager had a
request from a couple of Council Members for this presentation. I think it's
taken us quite a while to find a date that would work for you. I think all of
you know Palo Alto Housing Corp. has been an important partner for the
City, working actively to expand the supply of affordable housing in Palo Alto
since 1970. They've also managed the City's below market housing program
for quite some time, actually since 1974, and recently signed a new three
year agreement with the City for that work. With that, I'm going to hand it
over to Candace and Grace. I'd be happy to help them answer any
questions you have at the end of the presentation. Thank you.
