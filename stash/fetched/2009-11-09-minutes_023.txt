3.   Support the secondary alternative improvement for Ross Road which
     would include signalization of the intersection to provide a protected
     pedestrian and bicycle crossing of Oregon Expressway and facilitate the
     implementation of a bicycle boulevard along Ross Road.

4.   Direct Staff to work with the County, the neighborhood stakeholder
     groups, and the Palo Alto Bicycle Advisory Committee (PABAC) to
     develop detailed design plans and return to the Council with a report on
     the final design plans.

5.   Direct Staff to continue monitoring traffic conditions on Oregon
     Expressway after implementation of the improvements and to provide an
     update to the City Council six months after implementation.

Council Member Kishimoto asked whether signal timing was a part of the
plan.

Mr. Rius stated yes, signal timing was in the current Motion as part of the
physical changes.

Council Member Kishimoto asked whether            there   was   a   uniformed
landscaping plan for Oregon Expressway.

Mr. Williams stated the recommendation was to return with design plans
including landscape. He noted it did not include all of Oregon Expressway,
just the improvement areas.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to add “including landscaping” into No. 4 above.

Council Member Kishimoto asked the expected completion time for the
implementation of the project.

Mr. Akbarzadeh stated the design would begin once Council approved the
alternative. He stated there was a process with CalTrans for securing funding
and the timeframe for that was uncertain.

Council Member Kishimoto clarified the bid process would begin at the end of
2010.

Mr. Akbarzadeh stated probably not until 2011. He noted the CalTrans
process for securing funding was cumbersome.
