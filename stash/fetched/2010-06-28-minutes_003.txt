Council Member Price stated she would not participate in the Agenda Item
because the American Institute of Architects had a significant relationship
with Turner Construction.

Council Member Yeh stated the Downtown Library Measure N Bond Project
(Bond Project) required a Bond Oversight Committee to ensure appropriate
oversight. He did not see any mention of the Bond Oversight Committee’s
review of the contracts.

Director of Public Works, Glenn Roberts stated the Public Works Department
was responsible for the administration of the contracts on the Bond Project.
The Bond Oversight Committee had been established, and processes had
been put in place for a review of audit expenditures. The review by the
Bond Oversight Committee would take place after expenditures have been
made to ensure that funds were spent properly and were in compliance with
the original bond commitments. He ensured the City Council that the
process was consistent with the original intent of the Bond Project. The City
Auditor’s Office had an additional program to review the conformance of the
Bond Project.
