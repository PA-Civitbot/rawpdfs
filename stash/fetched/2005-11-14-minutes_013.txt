Mr. Emslie said the incremental cost of maintaining the fences was
much less than landscaping and they could be removed.

Council Member Freeman asked for the cost and whether money could
be moved from picket fence painting to landscaping the traffic circles.

Mr. Emslie said he believed the cost was negligible.

Council Member Freeman asked whether there were safety issues
related to them being removed.

Mr. Emslie said no.

Council Member Freeman asked whether the street closure at Palo Alto
Avenue and Middlefield Road was included in the landscaping idea.

Mr. Emslie said it only included the traffic circles.

Council Member Freeman asked whether the picket fences aided in
motoristsâ€™ understanding of the road closure.

Mr. Emslie said yes. On Palo Alto Avenue, it increased the visibility of
the street closure.

Council Member Freeman asked whether other picket fences existed in
Downtown North.

Mr. Emslie said yes. There was one on Waverley Street near Johnson
Park.

Council Member Freeman asked whether they were proven to be
effective safety measures.

Mr. Emslie said they did not provide closure or other diversion, but
were an adjunct to the street.

AMENDMENT: Council Member Freeman moved to remove picket
fences except for the ones located at Palo Alto Avenue and Middlefield
Road.

Council Member Mossar clarified there had not been any discussion of
whether the picket fences would remain or be removed.

Mr. Emslie said the motion included a proposal to landscape the traffic
circles, but did not include the picket fences.
