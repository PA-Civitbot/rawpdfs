Policy Implications
The City’s Comprehensive Plan recommends that the City enhance the California Avenue
streetscape by upgrading the visual quality of the street to attract additional business and
visitors to the area. Consistent with those Comprehensive Plan goals, the proposed streetscape
and place-making improvements along California Avenue should ensure continued growth and
enhancement of the California Avenue Business District. The Comprehensive Plan also
encourages a mix of residential and non-residential uses at a scale of development that is
comfortable for pedestrian use. The Plan encourages improving the appearance of the street
while preserving its “home town” character. Also, Program L-18 specifically calls out for street
improvements that could make a substantial contribution to the character of commercial
Centers, including narrowing travel lanes.

Environmental Review
The Initial Study and draft Negative Declaration are attached (Attachment A), and conclude that
no significant environmental impacts would result from the project. Approval of the Negative
Declaration for the California Avenue Transit Hub Corridor Improvement project is necessary
prior to initiating detailed design.
