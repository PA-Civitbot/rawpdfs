Mayor Holman: You have ten minutes of questions. It looks like we could
maybe put this on next week's agenda.

Mr. Keene: We'll work on that.        (inaudible) questions, but how much
conversation.

Mayor Holman: Right.

Council Member Kniss: That just starts the ball rolling.

Mayor Holman: Let's look at theâ€”the motion does not indicate where we
would put it. The Clerk and City Manager will look at putting it on next
week's agenda.

Mr. Keene: We'll look at the next two meetings. Thanks. That'd be good.
We start at quarter of 8:00 tomorrow.

Mayor Holman:      The motion is to continue Item 23 to a date to be
determined. That was the motion by Council Member Kniss, seconded by
Council Member ...

Council Member Kniss: Cory I think.

Mayor Holman:     ... Council Member Wolbach.       Do you have something,
Beth?

Beth Minor, City Clerk. This is a public hearing. Unless we continue it to a
date certain, we're going to have to re-advertise it.

Council Member Kniss: Then let's get a date certain.

Mayor Holman: Is City Manager okay if we continue this to next Monday's
meeting?

Mr. Keene: (inaudible)

Mayor Holman: Next Monday's agenda is scheduled to conclude at 9:00, but
then we have the very lengthy Closed Session after that.

Mr. Keene: (inaudible)

Council Member Kniss: I move we continue it to 'til next week.

Council Member Wolbach: Still second that.

Council Member Kniss: Whatever that date is.
