           statue of limitations in connection with the collection of back rent
           shall be tolled and suspended during the period that the
           agreement is in effect.
     3.    Direct staff to prepare an agreement between the General Fund
           and the Refuse Fund regarding use of the City-owned landfill.

Council Member Beecham pointed out that Phases IIA and IIB were closed
and not being used by the constituents for refuse. One of the rationales for
charging was because the land was not available for park use, but for a cost
of approximately $200,000, the land could be made available.

Council Member Kleinberg pointed out the original Byxbee Landfill Closure
and Park Development Schedule indicated that Phases IIA and IIB were to
be completed by summer 1995 and the park developed by summer 2003.
The public had been waiting for a park. Unused, closed land should be
turned into park land. There was no rationale for continuing to pay rent on
land that was no longer being used for refuse.

Mayor Kishimoto asked whether there was an estimate for turning the land
into a full park.

Director of Public Works Glenn Roberts stated the cost of development was
for all the remaining areas, IIA, IIB and IIC, which the Byxbee Master Plan
said would be done simultaneously. The estimated cost was $2 million,
which was a General Fund obligation rather than a Refuse Fund obligation.

Council Member Beecham stated he differentiated between making the land
into a park versus making it available to the public for much less. That could
be done for IIA and IIB separately.

Council Member Morton asked whether there were issues of methane
collection that needed to be resolved.

Mr. Roberts said there was a methane collection system on IIA and IIB
which was above ground. The system needed to be put underground, which
would cost approximately $200,000.
