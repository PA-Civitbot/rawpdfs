Slide         Mitchell Park Library and Community Center




Mitchell Park Community Center where we are this evening. And if you haven’t been
to the library yet, you haven’t seen the half of it. Palo Alto loves its libraries, approving
Measure N to support the renovation or reconstruction of 3 of our 5 libraries, with all
5 library projects completed now, including the reconstruction of this facility that has
already been proven very popular. Thank you to Allison Cormack for leading the
Measure N campaign.
