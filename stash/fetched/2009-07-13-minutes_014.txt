Mr. Williams stated prior to the reductions twenty-seven spaces were short of
meeting the zoning requirement.

Council Member Burt asked with the reductions.

Mr. Williams stated with the reductions there were eleven spaces short,
although there were reserved spaces being provided.

Council Member Espinosa asked the exact Floor Area Ratio (FAR) on the
reduced project size with the store expansion.

Mr. Williams stated the FAR would be 1.18 instead of 1.23.

Council Member Espinosa asked for clarification on Staffâ€™s concerns of the
process of returning the project to the P&TC, the ARB, and then returning to
the Council.

Mr. Williams stated the Ordinance specified the order of review and although
there were no substantive concerns he wanted to verify with the City
Attorney the order of review would not become a concern.

Mr. Baum stated he reviewed the Planned Community Ordinance and found
there was adequate flexibility should the Council make a specific direction to
alter the order of review.

Council Member Espinosa asked the parameters of mandating a grocery store
and what could be required.

Mr. Baum stated in a CN development the Council had minimal ability to
mandate requirements, in a Development Agreement the Council could
mandate specifics, and in a PC development there could be square footage
and type of retail requirements mandated.
