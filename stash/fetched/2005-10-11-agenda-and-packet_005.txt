On November 8, 2004, Council approved power purchase agreements for a 20 MW share of
wind energy from the PPM High Winds Project in Solano County (CMR:424:04) and a 50%
share of the output from a 3.2 MW Ameresco Santa Cruz landfill gas-to-energy project in
Watsonville (CMR:461:04). On January 18, 2005, Council approved a contract for 50% of the
output from a 6-13 MW Ameresco Half Moon Bay landfill gas-to-energy project (CMR:100:05).
On August 8, 2005, Council approved a contract for 50% of the output from a 2.8-4.1 MW
Ameresco Keller Canyon landfill gas-to-energy project (CMR:350:05). Wind energy deliveries
began in December 2004. The Santa Cruz landfill project is on schedule to begin operation in
December 2005, and the Half Moon Bay and Keller Canyon projects are expected to begin
operation by the end of 2006. Together, these four projects, when operational are expected to
meet 10 to 13% of Palo Alto’s annual electric energy supply. Palo Alto also receives 1% eligible
renewable resources from the small hydroelectric portions of the Calaveras Hydroelectric facility
and the Western Central Valley Project.



DISCUSSION
Palo Alto issued a Request for Proposals (RFP 114134) on August 3, 2005 for Renewable
Electric Power. Seven firms submitted proposals for 11 different projects, including wind,
geothermal, biomass, solar thermal, and photovoltaic technologies. Proposal price and contract
duration ranged from $63/MWh for 5 years to $300/MWh increasing at 3.5% for 25 years. The
PPM Shiloh wind project was selected as the most viable proposal. According to the American
Wind Energy Association, PPM is the fifth largest owner of wind energy installations and fourth
largest purchaser of wholesale wind power in the U.S.

The contract is similar to the PPM High Winds project agreement approved by Council in
November 2004, except that the energy is provided in monthly firm blocks and the facility will
be owned and operated by PPM Energy. Northern California Power Agency (NCPA) will serve
as the scheduling coordinator, managing the day-to-day balancing activities within the NCPA
pool; verifying deliveries; monitoring supplier compliance with contractual obligations; and
managing invoicing and payment. The remaining output of the Shiloh facility has been sold to
Modesto Irrigation District (33% for 10 years) and PG&E (50% for 15 years).

A copy of the contract is attached and available to the public on file with the City Clerk. The key
terms of the contract are as follows:
    • Term: 15 years, with deliveries beginning between December 2005 and January 2007.

   •   Quantity: 16.66% share of the 100-150 MW rated capacity (16.7-25 MW) of the
       proposed Shiloh Wind Power project. CPAU’s share of the expected annual output is
       50,000 to 75,000 MWh, or approximately 5-7% of Palo Alto’s annual electric retail load.
