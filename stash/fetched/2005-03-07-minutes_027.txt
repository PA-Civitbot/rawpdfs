Vice Mayor Kleinberg said she would like information on what authority the
Council had to modify the State mandate for secondary units during the ZOU
public hearing. She also noted how impressive it was to see a group of
citizens come to support the needs of the community (Friends of the Parks).

Council Member Kishimoto asked that all zoning items go in the packet a
week early to ensure the public would have time to digest the information
before the Council meeting.

Council Member Kleinberg requested the meeting be adjourned in memory
of Victor Ojakian’s mother-in-law, Alice Barth, who passed away on Tuesday,
March 1, 2005.

FINAL ADJOURNMENT: The meeting adjourned at 10:50 p.m. in memory of
Victor Ojakian’s mother-in-law, Alice Barth, who passed away on Tuesday,
March 1, 2005.
