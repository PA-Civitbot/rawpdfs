compromise and a compromise should still be worked out.           She did not
support the zone change.

Council Member Mossar stated the neighborhood wanted to convert this from
a large-scale medical center to a residential. The intent was to get rid of the
heavy commercial uses and replace them with residences.

Council Member Morton asked when it was a non-conforming use, did there
need to be a general definition of what the successful uses could be which
then could be changed by legislation.

Mr. Emslie stated he was correct. The code defines the difference between a
medical office and general office.

Council Member Morton stated in the future this particular problem would
not exist for this site.

Mr. Emslie agreed and stated unless the property is changed it could
continue to be medical.

Council Member Morton asked if the office next door could not go from being
an administrative office and into a medical office.

Mr. Emslie replied that he was correct.

Mayor Kishimoto stated she had never seen a transformer on someone’s
front lawn that served the whole neighborhood. She did not understand why
it was placed on a property owner’s front lawn.

Mr. Emslie stated it served the whole neighborhood.

Council Member Kleinberg stated the City had the responsibility for locating
this transformer and having other properties dependent upon it.

Council Member Drekmeier asked whether the City and the two parties could
come back together with the City as a partner to find a short-term solution,
which would address the concerns of the neighbor.

Assistant City Manager Emily Harrison stated there was no way to justify
using taxpayer money to participate in the compromise.

Mayor Kishimoto asked about possibilities for the other six properties with
same issue and she stated this was not spot zoning because they had been
zoned residential.
