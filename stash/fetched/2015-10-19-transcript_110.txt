can have to do this. I think that our gravity is to the community and not to
any particular group or non-group or something like that. This is an
important issue that we need to deal with.

Mayor Holman: Council Member Berman, now your light's on.

Council Member Berman: Yep. I absolutely agree we shouldn't bash
Commissions. I think that's why we need to be much more careful with the
words that we use from the dais.

Mayor Holman: With that, we will vote on the amendment to send the
Colleagues Memo to Policy and Services prior to PTC. That amendment fails
on a 4-4 vote.

AMENDMENT FAILED:          4-4 Berman, Scharff, Wolbach, Kniss no, Burt
absent

Mayor Holman: We return to the original motion which is to refer the matter
to the Planning and Transportation Commission. Seeing no lights, vote on
the board please. That passes on a 7-1 vote with Council Member DuBois
voting no.

MOTION PASSED: 7-1 DuBois no, Burt absent

Mayor Holman: That concludes that item. Council Members, can we quickly
dispatch the next item so that we can ..

Council Member Kniss: Can we quickly dispatch it?

Mayor Holman: We'd allotted half an hour to it. Let's see if we can do it in
15 minutes. That would get us out of here by midnight basically. You have
ten minutes of questions.

Council Member Scharff: (inaudible)

Mayor Holman: You did, you did.

Council Member Scharff: I'll be happy to discuss this some other night.

Council Member Kniss: I would move to continue this item.

Council Member Wolbach: Second.

Council Member Kniss: I think that calls for a vote.
