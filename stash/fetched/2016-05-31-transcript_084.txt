Council Member Kniss: 250,000 ...

Council Member Holman: For two years.

Vice Mayor Scharff:   For two years, so it was 500,000 total or was it 250
total?

Council Member Kniss: I think it was 250 total.

Mr. Keene: I think it was 250 total ...

Vice Mayor Scharff: Over the two year period.

Mr. Keene: The County matched it 125,000 each year. We ...

Vice Mayor Scharff: That's right. It's 500 for that. If everyone recalls, that
wasn't our first choice. Our first choice was to partner with local agencies.
We went through an entire process in that. We were unable to work out
how to give away our money to work with local agencies where we could
make it work.

Council Member Kniss: We spent a year on it.

Vice Mayor Scharff: We spent a year on it. This isn't something where we
could just say let's throw money at it and be productive. I don't want us to
lose sight of that. I've asked several times; I didn't ask hard enough that I
pushed it. I asked what happened to the money that we sent to the County.
What could we have to show for that effort? I don't think there's a single
Council Member here who could tell me that we gave that money to the
County, do we know what happened to it? Do we know what they used it
for?

Council Member Schmid: They had a report (inaudible) ago.

Vice Mayor Scharff: Two months ago.

Council Member Schmid: (inaudible) came and said thank you very much.
Here's what we've done with it. We've housed ..

Vice Mayor Scharff: What did he do with it?

Council Member Schmid: ... 10, 12 people.

Vice Mayor Scharff: They housed 10 or 12 people.

Council Member Schmid: That's a practical outcome.
