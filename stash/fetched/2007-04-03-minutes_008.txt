PUBLIC HEARINGS

6.   Public Hearing: Approval of a Negative Declaration, pursuant to CEQA
     for Each of the Sites (By Council Motion, item continued from
     03/12/07)

Director of Planning and Community Environment Steve Emslie said the
Council directed staff to rezone the four sites in August 2006. Staff was
asked to investigate sites that were zoned commercial with underlying
residential zoning not listed in the City’s Housing Element Inventory. Four
sites were found: 4329 El Camino Real (Palo Alto Bowl), 3981 El Camino
Real May Flower Motel), 725 San Antonio Avenue (Summerwinds Nursery)
and 4151 Middlefield Road (Office Building). The sites were taken through
the required Planning & Transportation Commission (P&TC) process for
recommendations.

Planning Manager Julie Caporgno said the item consisted of land use
changes and rezoning of four sites which include the Palo Alto Bowl, the
Mayflower Motel, the Summerwinds Nursery, and an office building adjacent
to the Summerwinds Nursery fronting Middlefield Road. On October 26,
2006, a community meeting was held with area residents and property
owners to discuss future uses of the sites under service commercial (CS) or
neighborhood commercial (CN) zoning. Staff prepared a Negative
Declaration for each site since there were no significant impacts from the
proposed use change. A traffic analysis was completed to evaluate the
potential traffic impact from each site and the conclusion was the change in
use from the exciting development would not result in significant additional
trips. The PT&C held two meetings, December 6, 2006 and on January 10,
2007 to discuss rezoning.       Each site was analyzed and evaluated for
04/03/07                                                                   8
