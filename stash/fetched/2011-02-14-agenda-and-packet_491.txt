Following are some highlights of the sales and use tax information we received:

   •   In Palo Alto, overall sales and use tax revenue (cash receipts) for the third quarter
       ending September 2010 increased by approximately $586,000, or 12.8%, (including pool
       allocations) compared to the third quarter ending September 2009.

   •   Statewide, some regions in California experienced increases while other regions
       experienced declines in sales and use tax revenue for the year ending September 2010,
       compared to the prior year ending September 2009. After ten consecutive quarters of
       decline or no growth, statewide sales and use tax revenue showed growth beginning first
       quarter ending March 2010. Statewide sales and use tax revenue has shown growth of
       3.7% during the third quarter ending September 2010 compared to the third quarter
       ending September 2009.

   •   Sales and use tax revenue totaled $19.0 million for the year ending September 2010, an
       increase of 2.4% from $18.6 million in the prior year ending September 2009. This
       amount includes sales and use tax for the City of Palo Alto and pool allocations from the
       State and Santa Clara County.

Preliminary estimates show the December 2010 unemployment rate in Santa Clara County at
10.4% and Palo Alto at 5.6%.

Economic Category Analysis

Analysis of six economic categories, for the year ending September 2010, shows that General
Retail comprised the largest percentage of Palo Alto’s sales and use tax revenue and
experienced 5.3% growth. Business to business experienced a 9.3% decline and comprised
21.6% of total revenues. Construction experienced an 11.3% decline, but it also represented
only 1.0% of total sales and use tax revenue.
