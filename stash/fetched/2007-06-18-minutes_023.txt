Mr. Mazer stated he could not give a firm answer, but it would be difficult to
arrange private financing without any contributions from the City.

Council Member Beecham asked what “any” included.

Mr. Mazer stated it meant the total assets that were being contributed.

Council Member Beecham stated it would just have to be figured out.

Mr. Mazer stated the first phase in the business plan was to do the
assessment of the potential sources of contributions that could be made.
RBC and NorthStar would then facilitate dialogue between the City and the
capital markets to evaluate the financing.

Council Member Cordell asked whether the proposal was correct with stating
that the head offices were in Calgary, Alberta and the operational
headquarters were in New York.

Mr. Mazer stated that was not correct.

Council Member Cordell asked for clarification regarding the proposal stating
those locations and the letterhead stating Idaho.

Mr. Mazer stated NorthStar was based in Denver and Boulder, Colorado.

Mayor Kishimoto asked what the relationship was between NorthStar and
RBC.

Mr. Mazer stated NorthStar worked with RBC on a number of projects all
over the United States to facilitate the financing of community based and
municipal based broadband networks.

Council Member Kishimoto asked what other broadband networks they had
worked on.

Mr. Mazer stated the consortium worked for Franklin County, Washington,
Pasco and the Seattle Broadband Project.

Mayor Kishimoto asked if the City did not put up the $30,000 and asked the
consortium to do it, would it still be possible.

Mr. Mazer stated it would have to be discussed.

Mayor Kishimoto asked whether the proposal was based on the City
eventually owning the system.
