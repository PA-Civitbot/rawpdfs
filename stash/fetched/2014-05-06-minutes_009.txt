Mr. Rossmann reported there was not a summary showing changes by
department from one fiscal year to the next. Staff had hoped to do that, but
did not have the capacity. Perhaps a chart could be provided during the
Finance Committee review.

Council Member Burt requested the chart reflect staffing changes by
department and net increases in positions. If there was a significant number
of position increases in one year, the Finance Committee would review that
closely.

Mr. Rossmann indicated the Budget proposed adding 17 positions.

Council Member Burt reiterated that the Proposed Budget contained details
but not a summary showing movement of positions.

Mr. Keene advised that Staff could provide a chart for the Finance
Committee.

Council Member Holman wanted to understand reasons for, methods for,
and operational functionality of transferring Development Services from
Planning and Community Environment.

Mr. Keene wanted to have an integrated one-stop shop. To do that, the
Budget had to be explicit about where people worked and how they were
assigned.    People could still have split assignments between two
departments. The next phase was to set up Development Services as an
fund independent of the General Fund in order to associate revenues with
expenditures. In order to implement the Blueprint, Staff needed to be
specific. This was not an uncommon way to deal with the development
process.

Council Member Holman would need additional explanation as Mr. Keene's
response raised more questions.

Mayor Shepherd thanked Staff for providing the organizational chart on page
3. It was the first time she could recall seeing it include all of Palo Alto.

ADJOURNMENT: The meeting was adjourned at 8:08 P.M.
