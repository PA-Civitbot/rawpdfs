Council Member Kishimoto asked whether a signal would ever be expected.

Mr. Emslie stated if a signal became warranted it would be because of
incremental growth in the traffic.

Mr. Williams answered Council Member Kishimoto’s question from earlier
that 15 parking spaces were required for guest parking spaces which was
one for every three units.

Council Member Kishimoto asked whether we could make conditions of
redevelopment to allow forward thinking with the Elks Lodge and Dinah’s
projects.

Mr. Emslie stated the way we acquired the Deodar Street Easements right-
of-way, was done incrementally. The City has half of the street from the
former Ricky’s owner with no participation on the part of the Elks other than
to consent to the project. In this case, the Elks development was still
pending and that was something that could be looked at when the Elks
property develops in terms of access.

Council Member Yeh asked whether we would know what the boundaries
would look like at this point.

Mr. Emslie clarified that he was asking regarding the proposed Summerhill
project.

Council Member Yeh stated yes.

Mr. Emslie stated yes and the Applicant was prepared to give us an overview
of the design.

Council Member Yeh asked whether that would be true on the other side as
well at the Wilkie Way Subdivision.

Mr. Emslie stated yes.

Council Member Yeh asked if the alternate path connection was approved
who would assume the costs of maintaining that path.

Mr. Emslie stated the developers are proposing to include that in the
maintenance that the Homeowners Association would be responsible.

Council Member Yeh asked how far along Elks Lodge was in their site design.
