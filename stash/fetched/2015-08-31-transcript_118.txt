Ms. Gitelman: ... TDM.

Council Member Burt:      I just have to find out whether the maker and
seconder accept that.

Council Member DuBois: Again, I think you may be going to policy level
where it's already there. I'm good with it, but I'm not sure it's called out as
one of these (inaudible).

Mayor Holman: Council Member Scharff, you said as seconder you're good
with that? Okay.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to add to the Motion, “Incorporate existing
Council policy on single occupancy vehicle reduction.”

Council Member Burt: I'm looking at Goal T-7, mobility for people with
special needs. I think at a minimum we want to add seniors, called out
there. I think senior mobility is a major issue that we need to include in our
thinking. I would offer mobility for seniors and people with special needs.

Council Member DuBois: It's T-6.

Council Member Burt: Oh, the current goal is T-6. The proposed goal would
be—I mean, the current goal is T-7, proposed goal is T-6. Just to add
seniors within that. I'm moving that as an amendment. People need to
respond.

Council Member DuBois: That's fine.

Council Member Scharff: That's fine.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to add to the Motion, “add to Goal T-6, ‘Mobility
for seniors and people with special needs.’”

Council Member Burt: Under proposed Goal T-4, that doesn't really seem to
capture anything in the—maybe this is once again a program—about
efficient and innovative parking. I mean, it's not just more parking that
we're talking about doing. It's this whole next generation of approaches to
parking.

Council Member Wolbach: Where was that?
