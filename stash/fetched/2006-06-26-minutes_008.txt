Californians to support a meaningful redistricting reform.    She urged
the Council to support the resolution.

Council Member Beecham registered a “no” vote. He said his opinion
was that this issue was not under the control of the City of Palo Alto
and his vote did not indicate disagreement or agreement with the
issue.

MOTION PASSED 7-1, Beecham no, Morton absent.

10.   Colleagues Memo from Council Members Beecham, Drekmeier
      and Mossar Requesting Direction to the Parks and Recreation
      Commission to Consider the Needs and Opportunities for
      Additional or Enhanced Water Recreation Access and/or Facilities
      and to Identify Ways in Which Palo Alto Might Support the San
      Francisco Bay Water Trail.

MOTION: Council Member Mossar moved, seconded by Beecham, to
direct the Parks and Recreation Commission to consider the needs and
opportunities for additional or enhanced water recreation access and/or
facilities and to identify ways in which Palo Alto might support the San
Francisco Bay Water Trail.

Council Member Mossar said The Bay Conservation and Development
Commission was updating the San Francisco Bay Plan and was looking
at water recreation needs around the bay. The state legislature had
established the San Francisco Bay water trail, which was a water path
where people could explore all areas of the Bay by water. She said the
Parks and Recreation Commission (PARC) was looking at ways to
determine the needs for recreational activities but did not include water
recreation. Understanding the recreational needs around the Bay when
establishing the Baylands Master Plan would be beneficial to ensure the
plan was compatible with the needs.

Vice Mayor Kishimoto asked to add the word “non-motorized” to the
motion since it was included in the colleagues’ memo.

Council Member Mossar said it was acceptable.
