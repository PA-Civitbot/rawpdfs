reports might have the same issues. He wanted a specific
recommendation that they have monthly reports of action items
and progress. A key period was during the Council break. There
would not be any reporting during that time but it might be just
the point and time where many important decisions would be
needed. He said that Staff should tell the Council what it would
receive.

Mr. Keene said he thought all of the Guiding Principles were
ultimately the Councilâ€™s prerogative and that the Council should
indicate what it wanted. Staff would support the production of
whatever report, written or verbal.

Mayor Yeh said the CPAC had not set up the frequency of its
meetings. He assumed that they might be monthly, but as a
committee they had to set its base agreements. He said that as
a member of the CPAC he was comfortable returning to Council
and stating what the frequency of the meetings would be and
some ideas on how they would report back to the full Council.

Council Member Klein agreed with the comments made on
Guiding Principle Number 7 and thought that the change of
referring to just 2012 solved the problem even though 2012-13
was more likely. He had several questions regarding cooperation
with PAUSD on what was before the Council that evening. He
asked Mr. Emslie if the report was shared with PAUSD.

Mr. Emslie said yes.

Council Member Klein     asked   if   PAUSD   had comments                or
suggested changes.

Mr. Emslie said no.

Council Member Klein said that the committee was being
appointed by the City Manager and asked if it was also being
appointed by the School Superintendent.
