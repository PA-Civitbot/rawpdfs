It was permissible at any election where candidates were listed on the Ballot
to move forward with the adoption of the Secretary of States lottery.

Council Member Schmid asked whether it was essential to have a Charter
Amendment approved by the people.

Ms. Stump stated no, it would avoid the administrative task of approving the
Resolution during election periods.

Vice Mayor Kniss recalled the cost of the Ballots and asked if the initiative
was added to another Ballot would additional costs be incurred.

Ms. Stump clarified the Clerkâ€™s numbers for the costs were per Measure. By
adding the lottery initiative to the reduction of Council seats Measure, the
charge would be for one Measure.

MOTION: Vice Mayor Kniss moved, seconded by Mayor Shepherd to
eliminate the lottery provision from the Charter, to be included in the
reduction of Council seats Measure on the 2014 Ballot.

Mayor Shepherd seconded the Motion because she believed changing the
Charter would save time on a regular basis voting on the lottery each
election.

Council Member Klein would not support the Motion since there was no
connection to the reduction in Council seats.

Council Member Holman asked what the accomplishment was in altering the
Charter.

Ms. Stump stated it was a Staff recommendation as a means to reduce
administrative tasks.

Ms. Grider declared there was not always a Resolution for the lottery issue
and when there was not a quorum of City Council Members available the
decision was to follow the Secretary of States lottery.

Council Member Holman asked if the matter could be addressed in the
Council protocols or no.

Ms. Stump stated no, it was in the City Charter and needed to be
implemented.
