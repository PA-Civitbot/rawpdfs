staff returned with information on height. The Council tried to gather
information to make the best solution possible.

Vice Mayor Beecham said the intent was to find the best solution
possible in a civilized fashion to keep things clear and organized.

Council Member Freeman suggested separate motions be made on
height, FAR, and sidewalks.

Council Member Kishimoto understood the Council was talking about
height before FAR and setbacks. There would be three separate
potential amendments.

Vice Mayor Beecham referred to the motion on page 11 of the Action
Minutes, “To direct staff to come back with suggested height
limitations for the PC area that would reflect greater densities along
Alma, backing down toward the eastern end of the area.”

Council Member Freeman asked about Council Member Kleinberg’s
addition.

Vice Mayor Beecham responded that Council Member Kleinberg’s
addition was incorporated into his amendment. Staff would advise the
Council on how the limitations affected the ability to promote private
investment in housing in the area.

Council Member Kleinberg clarified the wording included, “in
accordance with the previous Council’s policy framework for the SOFA
Plan.”

Vice Mayor Beecham said that was correct.

Council Member Freeman asked whether the FAR and sidewalks would
be incorporated.

Vice Mayor Beecham responded that was possible.
