    Action Items

    1.     Council Retreat for the Purpose of Discussing Council Priorities for
           2012, Topics for Future Council Retreats, and the Infrastructure Blue
           Ribbon Commission’s Report Findings, Recommendations, and Next
           Steps.

    Mayor Yeh stated that he had recommended to the Council to rollover the 2-
    year old Council Priorities into the third year, 2012, and asked to open up
    the recommendation for discussions or Motions.

    Council Member Klein said he did not have a problem with the
    recommendation. He said five Priorities were too many and needed to
    explore how other Cities handled priority setting. He suggested referring the
    process to the Policy & Services Committee (P&S) to review the definition of
    the Priorities and to recommend to the Council changes to the process.
