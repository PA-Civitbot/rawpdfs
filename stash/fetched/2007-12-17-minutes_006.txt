Mr. Roberts stated that would be part of the contamination factor. It was
part of the new Zero Waste initiative that would be introduced into the new
collection contract.

Council Member Morton asked what the plan was for long-term.

Mr. Roberts stated that this project would give us an opportunity for the
future to locate a permanent recycling center.

Council Member Morton stated there would be many demands on that site.

Council Member Mossar asked why the access road would need to be paved.

Mr. Roberts stated an all weather permanent surface for accessibility and
use would be necessary.

Council Member Mossar asked whether the road went from the entrance to
the water treatment plant.

Mr. Roberts stated the road they were discussing was a dirt road which
would be paved to access the landfill area.

Council Member Mossar asked whether above that road was a strip of
dedicated parkland.

Mr. Roberts stated that was correct.

Council Member Mossar asked why we would duplicate the single stream bin
concept at this recycling center when this service was distributed around the
community already.

Mr. Roberts stated there people who did self-haul either by residents or
contractors and this would become a centralized location.

Council Member Mossar asked whether this would be a regional service we
would be providing.

Mr. Roberts stated this would be for people in the area.

Council Member Mossar asked about the florescent bulb recycling capacity or
motor oil recycling.

Mr. Roberts stated that was an oversight and those programs were intended
to be continued.
