it's going to be used. People will actually congregate on the Adobe Creek
Trail extension, which has got to be a part of this. Maybe not the funding
part, but it's got to happen. People will gather, talk, visit and then they'll
start up the ramp. Those cyclists who come from the north and have to stop
to make their really sharp turn, again an opportunity for a visit before they
go across the bridge. When they cross the bridge, it's boring. It's just cars.
The fun is getting over to the east side and enjoying looking at the Baylands

     PE-11011.

Mayor Burt: Do you want to speak to your Motion?

Council Member Wolbach: Just a couple of things. First, I did hear a
number of members of the public and also during the presentationâ€”the
video by the way was very useful. It really highlighted one of the key areas
of concern for me. This fix on West Bayshore is really important. That's a
very frequent jogging route that I take. I know that area well. Having to
look over my shoulder, if I'm heading southeast on Bayshore, to make sure
that I'm not going to get run over by a car and how unappealing that would
be if I were any less athletic. I can imagine other people just having a very,
