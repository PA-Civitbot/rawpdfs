Roxy Rapp, P.O. Box 1672, said a fitness center would bring customers for
the retailers.

Shahram Seyedin-Noor, 3000 El Camino Real, said the Form Fitness
proposal would bring in more money for the City.

Paula Gooden, Casa Alta, said Form Fitness encouraged individuals of all
ages to participate.

Hanh Vo, Santa Clara, said Form Fitness would be able to provide childcare
to its members at the new location.

Scott Saslow, 152 Melville Avenue, said another restaurant was not needed
in Palo Alto.

Herb Borock, P.O. Box 632, said a change in the economy could bring
increased rent.

Allyssa, 10 Hawk View, Portola Valley, said Form Fitness was a place of
support for teens and adults.

Martin Bernstein, P.O. Box 1739, said it was important to rent to the tenant
that provided the least risk.

Tony Carasco, 4216 Darlington Court, said at the end of the ten-year lease,
the Saffron Club would have invested a large sum of money into the
infrastructure of the building.

Sal Giovanoto said the City should hire a realtor to handle the rental of the
property.

Jan Kapoor, 5470 Mohuivy Side Road, San Jose, said the Saffron Club would
become a destination Indian restaurant.

Jaime Arndt, 3442 Middlefield Road, said Form Fitness provided much more
than an exercise club. There was warm-hearted interaction and concern for
the well being of the members.

John McNellis, 310 Waverley Street, said a first class gym was needed
Downtown.

Stephanie, 461 Fairfax Avenue, San Mateo, said teens were tolerated rather
than welcomed at other gyms. Form Fitness encouraged everyone to
participate.
