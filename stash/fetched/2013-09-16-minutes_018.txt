Council Member Berman asked if Mr. Svensson would normally not consider
the financing cost of purchasing the land.

Mr. Svensson indicated the financing costs were built into other parts of
financing. It was not a significant cost; therefore, it was not included.

Council Member Berman asked why the consultant assumed the Developer
could obtain only 65 percent financing rather than 80 percent.

Mr. Svensson explained that 65 percent applied to the construction loan.
The long-term loan was calculated at 70 percent of loan to value ratio.

Council Member Berman asked why the long-term loan did not assume 80
percent financing.

Mr. Svensson reported that 70 percent was the amount quoted in research.

Council Member Berman inquired whether Staff requested a pro forma from
the applicant.

Mr. Svensson indicated Staff did not receive a pro forma from the applicant.

Ray Paul, Applicant, intentionally kept the discussion with Staff at arm's
length in order to provide an independent analysis. The applicant could not
obtain 80 percent financing.

Council Member Berman felt a pro forma from the applicant would be
valuable.

Mr. Paul noted the consultant's analysis was close to the applicant's analysis;
although, the methods were different. The applicant had detailed cost
estimates from professional estimators, including the mitigation costs
associated with the superfund site.       He did not share those, but he
understood them.

Council Member Berman encouraged the consultant to review the numbers
for inconsistencies. The use of high-end construction costs and rental rates
was logical.
