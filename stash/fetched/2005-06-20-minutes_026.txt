Council Member Freeman clarified no parking signs would not be posted.

Ms. Harrison said that was correct.

Council Member Kishimoto said the Midpeninsula Community Media Center’s
(MCMC’s) contract had been reduced in the past from $160,000 to $140,000,
and was being reduced again by another $40,000 to $100,000. She asked what
services were being eliminated as a result of the reduced contract.

City Manager Frank Benest said one of the eliminated positions previously
produced the City Beat cable show, which reduced the budget for the
Community Media Center.

Council Member Mossar stated she could not participate in Item No. 7 due to a
conflict of interest because she was an employee of the Community Media
Center.

Council Member Morton stated he could not participate in Item Nos. 11 and 20
due to a conflict of interest because he provided or had provided services to
those organizations receiving Community Development Block Grant Funds.

MOTION: Council Member Beecham moved, seconded by Cordell, to approve
