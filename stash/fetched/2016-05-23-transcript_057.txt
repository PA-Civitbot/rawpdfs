Mayor Burt: That's better.

INCORPORATED INTO THE SUBSTITUTE MOTION WITH THE
CONSENT OF THE MAKER AND SECONDER to replace in the Motion, “2,
4, 5, and 6. The Sherman Avenue and El Camino Real street faces cannot
be met” with “2, 4, 5, and 6 cannot be met regarding Sherman Avenue and
El Camino Real street faces.”

INCORPORATED INTO THE SUBSTITUTE MOTION WITH THE
CONSENT OF THE MAKER AND SECONDER to replace in the Motion, “to
make the following findings” with “to make findings in regards to.”

Mayor Burt: Council Member DuBois, I think you're going to need to say
what it is about the Comp Plan that you don't think it meets.

Council Member DuBois: That's what the rest of the sentence there is meant
to cover. Instead of following, it should say "in regards to loading space."

Mayor Burt: That's pretty vague.

Council Member DuBois: I think I'd be happy to have Staff come back with
making it compliant for those things based on my comments.

Mayor Burt: I'm sorry. It's incumbent on the Council to say what the
findings are. If you're saying it's not compliant with the Comp Plan, then
you have to say how. You can't just say ...

Council Member DuBois: I think I made my comments.

Vice Mayor Scharff: I think you need to say which Comp Plan policies it does
not (crosstalk).

Mayor Burt: Policies and programs.

Ms. Silver: There are some statements on the record that we could use to
support a finding of denial on Finding Number 4 with respect to
compatibility. What I would suggest is—we don't have that language here
right now. What I would suggest is that, if the motion does pass, Staff
would come back with a draft resolution, put it on Consent for the Council's
approval.

Council Member DuBois: That would be acceptable.

Mayor Burt: I would say we have to be cautious about just making blanket
statements that we think it's not compliant with the Comp Plan without
being concrete about how that is. It's a really important (crosstalk).
