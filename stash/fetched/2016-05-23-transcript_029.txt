Vice Mayor Scharff: Is the idea that during the day the office people would
use some of the residential space and the retail? How does that work?
What percentage? I guess all the non-reserved spaces?

Mr. Lait: Yes.

Vice Mayor Scharff: Got it. One other quick question. What is the CC(2)
zoning? What is the requirements of that? I understand what's in the CN.

Mr. Lait: Development standards or land uses? Are you interested in land
uses or development standards?

Vice Mayor Scharff: I'm interest inâ€”my understanding on the CN zoning, it's
1 FAR for residential, right?

Mr. Lait: Right. It's 0.5 for the CN for residential, and it's 0.6 for the CC(2).

Vice Mayor Scharff: Point six for the CC(2). There's the same amount of
office in either one. Is that correct?

Mr. Lait: For office in the CC(2), it's 2.0. For the CN, it's 0.4.

Vice Mayor Scharff: The CC(2) is much more office?

Mr. Lait: Yeah.

Vice Mayor Scharff: That's why it's a smaller parcel and you get the same
5,000 roughly. Right? No?

Mr. Lait: The 5,000 is not triggered by the CC(2). The applicant has left the
CC(2) alone and is not interested in ...

Vice Mayor Scharff: If they had developed the CC(2), they could have built
much more office.

Mr. Lait: They could have built more. To get to a prior question, about
4,000 square feet of additional residential could have been built.

Vice Mayor Scharff: Thank you.

Mayor Burt: Council Member Filseth.

Council Member Filseth: Thank you. I have four questions on the traffic
study, one on parking and one on the CUP. On the traffic study, if you look
at Packet Page 189, there's a table here. It says that if you look at the P.M.
peak hour, car trips are going to be reduced by 16. It's on the table, P.M.
