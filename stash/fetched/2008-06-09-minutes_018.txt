COUNCIL MATTERS

13.     Referral of the Criminal Investigation of the Children’s Theatre to
        Either the City Auditor or the Police Auditor

Mayor Klein noted the public would speak first.

Susan Phillips Moskowitz, 1941 Tasso Street, spoke to the investigation
offering the following questions:

   1) What of the wall between the administration and the investigators.
   2) Where was the leak for the termination.
   3) When did the police learn of the Statute of Limitations issues.
   4) Was the investigation pursued after the limitations.
   5) Why was the Yore Report released prior to the hearing.
   6) Why did the police not consider explicit and implicit approval by the
      City in conducting the costume sales.
   7) Did the City Manager urge Yore to go to Texas.
   8) What of the DA’s conclusion that there was no conclusion as to
      embezzlement since property never left the theatre.
   9) Why did the police not take the above, property related issue, into
      account.

Katie Christman, 1340 Byron Street, stressed innocence over being proven
guilty, in support of Rich Curtis.
