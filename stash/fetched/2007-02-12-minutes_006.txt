Clerical Study. He said City Management conducted a Clerical Study in
agreement with Service Employees’ Industrial Union (SEIU). All clerical
positions were analyzed, career ladders were developed, and job description
drafts were submitted to SEIU. SEIU grieved 23 job descriptions which
required 250 hours of staff time to respond. There was a delay due to an

job descriptions, and a survey would be conducted in the job market field to
determine appropriate compensation.
