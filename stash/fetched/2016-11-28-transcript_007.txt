Mayor Burt:       Item Number 3 will be pulled.      Does that need to be
rescheduled for a future date or is this—I guess it's dependent on whether
this is a relatively brief discussion this evening.

James Keene, City Manager: Yes, Mr. Mayor. Council did not give us
advance notice of pulling this. Not really in a position to speak to that. In
any case … Are you here to try to take action on it right now?

Hillary Gitelman, Planning and Community Environment Director: I think we
should, because it affects the resources available for the Comp Plan.

Mr. Keene: We'll let you finish with the Consent Calendar, and then we can
take this matter up.

Mayor Burt: Just a reminder to colleagues. It's our protocol to attempt to
notify Staff in advance if we intend to pull items, so that they can attempt to
have appropriate Staff here so that we hopefully would be able to contend
with it in a timely manner. Do we have a Motion to approve Items 2-8
excepting Item 3?

Vice Mayor Scharff: So moved.

Council Member Filseth: Second.

MOTION: Vice Mayor Scharff moved, seconded by Council Member Filseth
to approve Agenda Item Numbers 2, 4-8.

Mayor Burt: That's Motion by Vice Mayor Scharff, second by Council Member
Filseth. Please vote.
