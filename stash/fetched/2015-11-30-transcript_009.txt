available, the additional FAR square footage, provided that it is not
necessary to reduce the square footage in order to modify the project. It
also must be compliant with specific requirements of the Municipal Code.
That's what your TDR ordinance says. No specific requirements have been
identified that have not been satisfied. Things like height, parking, setback,
circulation, etc., all of those have been met. The ARB is the body that you
have charged and they are the professionals that you have selected to

than we're accustomed to, that is really not relevant given the fact that you
have agreed that they can have a larger building as long as it meets the
specific requirements and the architectural requirements. In any case, the
mass is going to be greater, the visibility is going to be greater, and the
building is going to be more prominent given these FAR transfers. You must
take that into consideration if you're applying your own ordinances fairly.
This is what is and what should be expected of the City and of its residents.
The previous iteration of this project met all the requirements of the Code
and received the approval recommendation of the ARB. Here in response to
the Council, mass and visibility really is no longer the issue. Compatibilityâ€”
