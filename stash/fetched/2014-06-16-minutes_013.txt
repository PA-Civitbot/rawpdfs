AGENDA CHANGES, ADDITIONS AND DELETIONS

Mayor Shepherd asked if there was consensus for a special City Council
meeting for Wednesday, June 18th for some of the Agenda Items from this
evening’s agenda.

Council Member Burt suggested discussing June 30th as the next City Council
meeting since Council Members will be out on Wednesday, the 25th.

Council Member Scharff requested Council reflect by a show of hands who
will be out on June 30th. He believed a number of the Agenda Items could be
reviewed quickly.

Mayor Shepherd     acknowledged   the   meeting   was   30-minutes   behind
schedule.

Council Member Holman stated she could attend on June 25th but not until
7:00 pm.

MOTION: Council Member Scharff moved, seconded by Vice Mayor Kniss to
move Action Item Number 24, “Resolution of the Council of the City of Palo
Alto Authorize the Placement of a Ballot Measure on the November 4, 2014
General Election to Increase the City’s Transient Occupancy Tax (TOT) by
Two Percent and Modernize TOT Ordinance to Ensure Equal Treatment of
Traditional and Online Bookings”, to the Consent Calendar deferring it to
Finance Committee.

Mayor Shepherd asked if the item could be discussed once it was moved to
Consent.

Molly Stump, City Attorney, explained Council could speak to the Motion;
although, once the Motion was approved the Item could not be spoken to.

Council Member Klein was uncertain Item 24 could be moved to Consent
because it requested Council discussion.

Ms. Stump stated the Motion included additional information but felt it was
not a notice issue because the potential action was noticed.
