Council Member Cordell asked whether it was the first “turn-key” project the
City had undertaken and noted a private developer had initiated the project.

Ms. Harrison said yes and it was recognized the private developer had access
to significant cost savings.

Council Member Cordell asked whether the City Auditor had approved the
process.

City Auditor Sharon Erickson said opening a fair and transparent process
would generate the best project at the best price.

Council Member Freeman said some of the criteria in the staff report
(CMR:349:05) narrowed the opportunity for participation. She suggested
amending the motion to remove Bullet No. 1 under Criteria.

Vice Mayor Kleinberg requested clarification.

Ms. Harrison said the wording in the staff report (CMR:349:05) should be
changed to add “combination of public and private land was acceptable.”

SUBSTITUTE MOTION: Council Member Freeman moved to accept the staff
recommendation but remove Bullet Nos. 1 and 7 under the criteria.

Vice Mayor Kleinberg asked the reason for the criteria in the staff’s
recommendation.

Ms. Harrison said a “turn-key” proposal ensured there was land with the
building included. Companies would be required, by criteria, to identify a
reasonable site on which to build.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION FAILED FOR LACK OF A SECOND

Council Member Kishimoto asked whether the $45 million estimate included
the purchase of land and how much of the cost was for land.

Mr. Roberts confirmed it included the purchase of land, which was estimated
at $3 million.

Council Member Kishimoto said resources would be diverted from other new
capital projects if the project were debt financed. The staff report
(CMR:349:05) indicated $3 million would be needed to finance the debt.

Mr. Roberts confirmed there was an unfunded gap.

Council Member Kishimoto said the impending projects should be prioritized.
