Council Member Berman: Sure. Let's say our TMA efforts yield 60 percent
decrease in single occupancy vehicle trips. Do we all of a sudden reevaluate
what our parking per square foot of office space or housing or that kind of
thing, regulations if it's clearly being shown that our Transportation Demand
Management efforts are working?

Council Member DuBois: When I proposed "six," I was specifically talking
about transportation and parking. If we could add that clarification to "six"
and "seven," I think I'd be okay with that. I think it's too large to say that
you want to adjust (crosstalk) zoning or something like that.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to add to the Motion, “evaluating relaxing
regulations if mitigation measures are succeeding.” (New Part G)

Mayor Burt: Council Member DuBois, I'm not sure if they captured this. Is
it evaluate transportation and parking regulations or transportation and
parking mitigation measures?

Council Member DuBois: It's both, I guess.

Council Member Berman: I'd be fine with that for "seven." Obviously 10
years for now if things are going great and there's no traffic, people can
have a different conversation then.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to add to Motion Parts F and G, “transportation
and parking” after “evaluating.”

Mayor Burt: Should we just combine these two and say if mitigation
measures are—we're just talking about evaluating (crosstalk) are failing ...

Council Member DuBois: Or succeeding.

Mayor Burt: ... or exceeding expectations.

Council Member Berman: Sure.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to combine and restate Parts F and G as,
“evaluating transportation and parking regulation triggers if mitigation
measures are failing or exceeding expectations.” (New Part F)

Council Member Berman: That's all I have for now.

Mayor Burt: Council Member Holman.
