City Attorney Gary Baum stated the FBO leases were usually bound by the
County and therefore any negotiations of early termination may be very
costly.

Mayor Kishimoto asked regarding the levy situation.

Mr. Fellman stated there has not been a letter received by the County as of
yet.

Mayor Kishimoto asked whether the Board of Supervisors had implicated the
City responsibility to maintain the levyâ€™s.

Mr. Fellman stated yes.

Mayor Kishimoto asked if the levy report would not be available until 2018,
how important the alternatives were in Attachment A.

Mr. Fellman stated currently alternatives were being studied although there
would be no definite information until 2010.

Mayor Kishimoto stated she would not support the Motion.

Council Member Beecham asked why there was a three year timeframe for
completing the transfer.

Mr. Yeats stated there were many steps to the transfer including Grants
awarded to the County that needed to run their course before the City could
apply for them.

Council Member Beecham questioned why the economic study would take a
year to compile.

Mr. Yeats stated due to the fuel on the site it was required to complete a
hazmat study.

Council Member Beecham stated he would not support the Motion.

Vice Mayor Klein stated the airport belongs to the City so no matter what
impacts may occur it would seem more feasible to accomplish the necessary
repairs without going through the County or their subcontractor.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION: Mayor Kishimoto, seconded by Cordell to delay
until 2010 the consideration of an orderly transition of the airport.
