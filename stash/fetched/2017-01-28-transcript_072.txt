even just the original one that you had, Karen, living up to Code
enforcements and City agreements.

Council Member Holman: City agreements.

Council Member Kou: It's necessary to keep that in there in order to have
us focus on ensuring that all these agreements we have around town are
lived up to and we don't have citizens over here having to come forward and
tell us or monitor all of these agreements also. I do think that should
remain as a Priority. Thanks.

Mayor Scharff:    Let's vote on the Amendment.         All in favor of the

Substitute Motion. The Substitute Motion no longer includes "5." Vote on
the Substitute Motion. The Substitute Motion fails.

Mayor Scharff: Now, we'll vote ..

Council Member Holman: I still needed to get the clarification.

Mayor Scharff: What's your clarification?

Council Member Holman: The clarification is if commercial development
does not need to be addressed and is rolled into the built environment
