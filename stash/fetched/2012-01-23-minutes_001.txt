Study Session

1. Emergency Medical Services.
Dr. Harold Cohen of SPC/TriData presented the Emergency Medical Services
Study to the Council. This report was commissioned at the request of
Council after TriData did a Fire Services Utilization Study in 2010 and the
City Council sought to understand more about the Palo Alto Fire
Department’s Emergency Medical Services delivery model. Dr. Cohen
reviewed the Palo Alto Fire Department’s EMS efforts and made 21
recommendations in the report. He also provided staff with a five year
strategy to improve service delivery. These recommendations included
staffing, deployment, relationships with County EMS and support functions.
Staff will review these recommendations and consider them for
implementation.

Herb Borock spoke regarding the facility transport was guaranteed to collect
the amount of money charged as it was not an emergency transport. He
added the report indicated Station Seven would close. That station shouldn’t
close as it was required to be covered by Stanford under the Department of
Energy. He suggested the report may have had a typographical error.

Stephany Munoz said that civil servants have Medicaid payments to health
services providers matched. This suggested the government receives a
discount on medical services. The police and sheriff in the county have the
right to send a person against their will in an ambulance.
