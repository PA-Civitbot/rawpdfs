Mayor Scharff: If you think it's large, I'm thinking about what the size of a
yoga studio is. It's not 1,000 feet; it's bigger than that. I think 2,500
square feet is probably (crosstalk).

Mr. Lait: We've traditionally had studios come in at about 1,200—1,250, I
think, is the largest one that we've approved in the Downtown area. This
one on California is an anomaly.

Mayor Scharff: The one on California is much bigger than that.

Mr. Lait: It's 5,000 or 6,500 square feet; it's huge.

Mayor Scharff: That's what I thought it was.

Mr. Lait: Imagine that use on Hamilton, and imagine not just—you're
getting 50 people in your yoga classes. Something like that can be filled
with hundreds of people. We think about the parking and the traffic. That's
why we have a CUP for that.

Mayor Scharff: Would you suggest 1,500 square feet then? Would that be
fine?

Mr. Lait: Did you say 30 people?

Mayor Scharff: No, I said 50 people.

Mr. Lait: I don't have a recommendation on the size of the space. I think
it's something that warrants consideration.

Council Member Holman: If you don't mind, can we defer this to Staff and
have them come back with a recommendation? As Jonathan said, it is
midnight.

Mayor Scharff: No. I'm going to go …

Council Member Holman:      With the second reading, they could come back
with …

Mayor Scharff: I think we should just get it done. I'm actually going to go
with 1,800 square feet and call it a day. That's under 2,000, close to what
Staff wanted.

AMENDMENT RESTATED: Mayor Scharff moved, seconded by Council
Member Fine to add to the Motion, “replace Section 18.040.030(114)(H)
with, ‘fitness and exercise studios or similar uses of 1,800 square feet or
less.’” (New Part H)
