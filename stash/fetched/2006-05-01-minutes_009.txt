Sasson Golafshan, 445 Bryant Street, said the site for the proposed project
was located in a poor location with accessibility issues. He said the space
did not allow for any retail to succeed.

location for the proposed project. He said visibility was a key element for a
successful retail property.

Tim Steele, 315 Homer Street, expressed support for the project.

Reza Moodi, 3375 Alma Street, said the Alma Plaza project would not attract
shoppers due to the location.
