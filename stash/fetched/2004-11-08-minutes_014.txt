City Manager Frank Benest said the ultimate policy would be the decision of
the Police Chief and the City Manager. The operational policies of the Police
Department were not approved by the City Council.

Council Member Kleinberg said the expenditure required the confidence of
the public.

Mr. Benest agreed.

Council Member Kleinberg said for the record, she would look for the most
inflexible policy to return to the Council. The policy should maximize the
expenditure and obtain the greatest degree of public confidence in the Cityâ€™s
law enforcement.

Vice Mayor Burch asked the Police Chief whether the system would be used
anytime a police officer made a stop.

Ms. Johnson confirmed. The more up-to-date cameras ran consistently.

Vice Mayor Burch asked whether the police officers were instructed to turn
on the cameras when they made stops.

Ms. Johnson said there would be specific circumstances that required an
officer to turn on the camera.

Council Member Freeman said she believed the cameras should be used at
all times. She asked how the tapes would be used and whether they would
become public information.

Ms. Johnson said the tapes would be used for training purposes and in
investigations when there were allegations against a police officer.

Mr. Baum said when the tapes were used for investigations or crimes, they
would not be made public.

Council Member Freeman asked how long the tapes would be archived.

Ms. Johnson said there would be a minimum requirement of one year.

Council Member Freeman asked whether there would be public input and a
policy prior to the approval.

Ms. Johnson said the intent was to get the cameras installed as quickly as
possible. The policy would be brought back to the Council when a vendor
was selected.
