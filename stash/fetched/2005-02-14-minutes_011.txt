the California Avenue district signed a petition opposing the new police
building to be built on the parking lots.

Sanford Forte, 280 College Avenue, said dual use of the new building should
be considered.

Arthur Keller, 3881 Corina Way, said re-use of building space should be
considered.

Herb Borock, P.O. Box 632, said the police should be as close as possible to
its civilian oversight.

MOTION: Mayor Burch moved, seconded by Cordell, to direct staff to bring
back more information on the California Avenue site. That information
should include:

  •   Comparison of the pros and cons of the California site, compared to
      the Civic Center site, including temporary and ongoing costs.
  •   Analysis of issues raised by California Avenue merchants regarding
      surface parking and disruption to businesses during construction.

Council Member Beecham said, if passed, there should be a full discussion
about construction noise and impacts.

Council Member Morton stated he would not participate due to a conflict of
interest because his office was located on Sherman Avenue.

Council Member Morton left the meeting at 10:25 p.m.

Council Member Freeman asked for the square footage of the current police
facility.

Assistant City Manager Harrison said she believed it was approximately
20,000 square feet.

Council Member Freeman said the City’s government offices should be
constrained to a smaller capacity rather than increased. She asked whether
any approved funds had been spent on the new police building design.

Ms. Harrison said staff would need to return with a Budget Amendment
Ordinance to continue with a conceptual design.

Council Member Freeman said the use of the current Police Department’s
square footage should be considered.

Council Member Kishimoto asked about the study, which indicated the
California Avenue location as the most expensive site to build a new police
facility.
