Council Member Kleinberg asked the reason for not using San Mateo County
data considering the hospital was on the border of the two county lines.

Ms. Funk stated a similar analysis was done in San Mateo County, which was
not significantly different. She stated a comparison of the two counties
would have made minimal difference.

Council Member Kleinberg inquired why the San Mateo County data would
not be used.

Ms. Funk responded the information where the project was located would be
generally used.

Council Member Kleinberg asked whether Ms. Fund had reviewed the
response analysis from the other professional group.

Ms. Funk declared she had just received it.

Council Member Kleinberg asked whether data not about hospitals would be
used.

Ms. Funk responded the information used would be from a collection of
medical facilities. She stated this would be a generic analysis, not exactly
about Stanford.

Council Member Drekmeier asked to explain the affordability gap from
Attachment B, page 3.

Ms. Funk stated the affordability gap was what the costs would be to develop
the unit and what the purchaser could afford.

Council Member Drekmeier asked for the difference in amounts between low
income and moderate income.

Ms. Funk replied the very low and low incomes would be accommodated in
rental units; whereas, the moderate components would be accommodated in
condominiums.

Council Member Drekmeier inquired             about   the   difference   between
apartments and condominiums.

Ms. Funk stated the Below Market Rate (BMR) program focused on
condominium units; whereas, the apartments would be an estimate of what
the minimum building costs would be.

Council Member Drekmeier inquired whether the market would be the
reason.

Ms. Funk responded they do not have experience for market rate rentals to
determine the exact cost.
