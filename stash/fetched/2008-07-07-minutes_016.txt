Mayor Klein stated the questions needed to be refined and combined to a
reasonable number.

Council Member Espinosa supported the Motion.

City Attorney Gary Baum stated the Council could give authority to the
Committee to move forward therefore bypassing a return visit to the
Council.

Council Member Schmid stated the Police Auditorâ€™s role appeared to be
reviewing the same information reviewed by the police which seemed
redundant and time consuming. He recommended the Police Auditor review
the policy and procedures, and report requirements, and oversights.

Council Member Yeh recognized the importance of the ongoing process
however; the focus of the Police Auditor should be to uncover how the
matter occurred and what could be done to prevent a reoccurrence. He
stated he did not support the Motion.

Council Member Espinosa stated understanding the mistakes made was
required in order to understand necessary changes to the processes.

Mayor Klein stated the audit of the police action was designed to determine
whether the Police Department acted properly. The accounting procedures
were a separate issue and were to be reviewed separately.
