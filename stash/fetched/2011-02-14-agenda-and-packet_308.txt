                                 (e)      Reports of officials.

                                         (f)      Council matters. Any two Council Members may
                                         bring forward a colleague memo on any topic to be
                                         considered by the entire Council. Two Council Members
                                         are required to place such a memo on the agenda, reflective
                                         of the Council procedure requiring a motion and a second
                                         for consideration of a motion by the Council. Up to four
                                         Council Members may sign a colleague memo. The City
                                         Attorney recommends that the colleague memo be limited
                                         to three Council Members in order to avoid the potential of
                                         a Brown Act issue. Prior to preparing a colleague memo,
                                         Council Members will consult with the City Manager to
                                         determine whether he/she is or is willing and able to
                                         address the issues as part of his/her operational authority
                                         and within current budgeted resources. Colleague’s memos
                                         should have a section that identifies any potential staffing
                                         or fiscal impacts of the contemplated action. This section
                                         will be drafted by the City Manager. Council Members
                                         shall provide a copy of the proposed memo with the City
                                         Manager or appropriate senior staff prior to finalization.
                                         Completed Council colleagues memos shall be provided to
                                         the City Clerk’s staff by noon on the Tuesday prior to the
                                         Council meeting that the memo is intended to be agendized,
                                         to provide time for the City Clerk to process for the
                                         Council packet.
