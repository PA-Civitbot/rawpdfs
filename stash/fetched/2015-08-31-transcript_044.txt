Council Member Kniss absent.

MOTION PASSED: 8-0 Kniss absent

Mayor Holman: City Clerk, it looks like we need to go a third round. Would
you care to report out?

Beth Minor, City Clerk: You are correct, Madam Mayor. We have Council
Member Berman voting for Mark Harris; Council Member Burt voting for Arne
Ballantine; Council Member DuBois voting for Mark Harris; Council Member
Filseth voting for Arne Ballantine; Mayor Holman voting for Mark Harris;
Council Member Scharff voting for Arne Ballantine; Vice Mayor Schmid
voting for Arne Ballantine, Council Member Wolbach voting for Marianne Wu.
We had Arne Ballantine with four votes, Mark Harris with three, and
Marianne Wu with one.

Mayor Holman: Council Members, we need to give one more go at this.
Council Member Wolbach has a procedural question.

Council Member Wolbach: It might be a little bit late now. I was just going
to suggest that we narrow it down to the two who had received the most
votes in the prior round.

Council Member Burt: You can do that.

Council Member Wolbach: I would encourage my colleagues to do that.

Mayor Holman: Council Members, please place your ballot on the dais. We
will open Item 13, and we will have the Clerk report in during this item as
they have results.
