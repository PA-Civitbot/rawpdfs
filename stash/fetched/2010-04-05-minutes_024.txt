13.   Adoption of an Ordinance Amending Title 2 (Administrative Code) of
      the Palo Alto Municipal Code to Amend Section 2.28.230 (Claims) of
      Chapter 2.28 (Fiscal Procedures), Section 2.33.110 (Refunds; Credits)
      of Chapter 2.33 (Transient Occupancy Tax), Section 2.34.220
      (Refunds) of Chapter 2.34 (Real Property Transfer Tax) and Section
      2.35.190 (Refunds) of Chapter 2.35 (Utility Users Tax).

Deputy City Attorney, Amy Bartell stated the proposed Ordinance would
amend the Cityâ€™s Claims Ordinance to clarify the refunds procedures and the
statute of limitations would be the same as applied to Claims Against the
City and the Refunds Against the City. She stated the amended Ordinance
would protect the City against costly fiscal impacts of having to defend
against tax refund litigation before the taxes were paid on the Transient
Occupancy Tax, Real Property Transfer Tax or the Utility Users Tax.

MOTION:      Vice Mayor Espinosa moved, seconded by Council Member
Holman to Adopt the Ordinance updating procedures for filing claims for
refunds of taxes, fees and charges by the City.

Vice Mayor Espinosa stated the Amendment was a fiscally responsible
movement.
