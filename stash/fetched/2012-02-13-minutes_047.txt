    particular site. She didn't take it lightly that the Council was moving
    property into the zoning category Public Facility, as it was intended for the
    highest and best use of the community. She couldn't think of a better or
    higher use for this site.

    Council Member Schmid was delighted to participate in the initiation of this
    project, and looked forward to the detailed review by the Planning and
    Transportation Commission, Architectural Review Board and the
    Environmental Review.

    Vice Mayor Scharff found the applicant's and former Mayor Beecham's
    stories moving.    He stated it was a fantastic community asset and
    appreciated their work.

    Council Member Questions, Comments and Announcements

    Council Member Shepherd reported that Project Safety Net was recognized
    in Western City Magazine. She also reported that she attended a recent
    Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) Policy Advisory
    Committee Meeting as an alternate. She said they announced 100 percent
    of their electrical needs in their yard were met by solar energy. She said
    the certified housing element requirement by the Metropolitan
    Transportation Commission will not be advocated by the VTA. There had
    been a proposal to redirect federal funds awarded to Palo Alto for the
    California Avenue Project. They would need an option to redirect those
    funds, and they have prepared two motions for the VTA board to redirect
    the funds to the Highway 101 project for sound walls.

    ADJOURNMENT: The meeting was adjourned at 11:02 P.M.
