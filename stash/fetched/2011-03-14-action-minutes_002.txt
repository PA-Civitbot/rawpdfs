2. Infrastructure Blue Ribbon Commission.

Members of the Infrastructure Blue Ribbon Commission (IBRC) briefed
Council on the progress on the Commission’s work. The Commission was
formed to develop recommendations on eliminating the backlog of Capital
Improvement Projects (CIPs) for City facilities, parks and streets. It has
been meeting since November, 2010 and plans to bring its final
recommendations to Council in December, 2011. The Commission has
formed three Committees: Above Ground, Surface and Finance. The Above
Ground Committee will make recommendations for City buildings and the
Surface Committee will do the same for streets and parks. The Finance
Committee will explore methods of funding the needed improvements and
make recommendations on how best to obtain the funds to take care of
deferred maintenance, and insure that the City is able to keep up with
maintenance in the future. A number of Council Members asked the
Commission to also explore new City facilities which may be needed and to
plan for the next 25 years.

At 8:42 p.m. the City Council continued the meeting in the Council
Chambers.
