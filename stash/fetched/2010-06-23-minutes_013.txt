Energy & Environmental Design for Neighborhood Development (LEED-ND).

Council Member Shepherd asked whether the economic study portion of the
Rail Corridor Study would be coming back to the Council on July 12, 2010.

Mayor Burt said it was his understanding that it would be included in the
HSR scope of work budget.

Mr. Williams said it was removed from the Corridor Study and would be done
in conjunction with the on-going HSR assessments.

Council Member Scharff asked if the Comp Plan policy that supported the
Concept Plan for the Stanford Shopping Center housing could be included in
the RHNA allocation.

Mr. Williams said it could not because it was not specific enough for the
Housing Element and needed to be zoned sites in order to be credited in the
Comp Plan.

Council Member Scharff asked if it meant not having a Planned Community
(PC) zone between San Antonio Road and Charleston Road if the South El
Camino Real Concept Plan were approved.

Mr. Williams said there would be no residential intensification until a plan
was developed to fit the intensification.
