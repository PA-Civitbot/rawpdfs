Council Member Barton asked whether there was anything Palo Alto could do
to enhance the desire of visitors.

Ms. Le Clair stated it was a matter of educating people unfamiliar with the
City and its amenities.

Council Member Burt asked whether the Bureau had previously booked
locations outside of Palo Alto for Stanford events.

Ms. Le Clair stated yes, although once the Four Seasons in East Palo Alto
had joined the program, the goal was to include the cities where there were
activities such as Stanford.

Council Member Burt asked whether the intention of the calendar was to
promote events based upon how worthy they were of a visitors’ attention or
equalization of participants.

Ms. Le Clair stated both cases applied.

Council Member Burt stated Stanford was a major draw for Palo Alto and a
regional draw to surrounding cities; therefore one would believe Palo Alto
would be covered more broadly on the events calendar.

Ms. Le Clair stated her agreement.

Council Member Burt asked whether Staff’s intention was to provide the
metrics given them by the Bureau or to work out a defined set of metrics of
expectation.

Ms. Barnes stated Staff received the metrics from the Bureau, now Staff
needed to gather what was being requested by Council in order to develop a
specific table of metrics.

Council Member Burt stated a meaningful metric would be what occurred
over the past year in the surrounding cities versus Palo Alto that information
needed to be converted into dollars, and the impact of occupancy levels on
average daily rates.

Council Member Espinosa stated when the program was initially brought to
Council it was stated that there would be minimal data during the initial
start-up. The first year had passed and the same questions were still being
asked and the answers were the same.
