MOTION PASSED: 9-0

12.   Discussion and Appointment of a Council Member to the Board of
      Directors of the Bay Area Water Supply & Conservation Agency
      (BAWSCA) and the Bay Area Regional Water System Financing
      Authority.

Mayor Holman: I'm asking for any volunteers for that assignment.

Council Member Kniss: It's a four-year assignment by the way.

Mayor Holman: Four, not three?

James Keene, City Manager: It's three or four; I can't remember which.

Mayor Holman: Vice Mayor Schmid, are you offering?

Vice Mayor Schmid: Yes, I would be willing to do it. I've been on the Santa
Clara Valley Water District Boards and Commission for five years. Happy to
follow up. If anyone else wants to, I'd be delighted.

Mayor Holman: Are there any other offers? I would really like to have an
alternate.

Council Member Burt:   Council Member Kniss said this is a four-year
assignment. How does that work with those of us who term out in a year
and a half?

Mayor Holman: I don't know this absolutely, but I would think that if a
Council Member is termed out while serving a term on Bay Area Water
Supply and Conservation Agency (BAWSCA), that you could also supplement
with somebody else. It doesn't mean the same person has to serve, does it?

Molly Stump, City Attorney: Council Members, I believe that this is an
unusual type of appointment that does not expire on leaving office in Palo
Alto.

Mayor Holman: Meaning that someone else could step in or not step in?

Ms. Stump: Meaning that the person could continue to serve.

Mayor Holman: You continue to serve even after leaving office.

Ms. Stump: Yes. Although, I believe that the Council does have the
authority to make an alternative appointment.
