Gregory Kerber, Birch Court Condominium Complex, said the only issue that
should be considered that evening was the Planning and Community
Environment Directorâ€™s recommendations and appeal of July 2003.

Lisa Habbeshaw, 2504 Birch Street, said the property had been issued a
permit in June 1973. No modifications or review had been made in over 30
years.

MOTION: Vice Mayor Burch moved, seconded by Beecham, to continue the
application for a Conditional Use Permit (CUP) and an Appeal of an Existing
Use Permit to a date uncertain.

Council Member Freeman asked if a municipal code or any City procedures
had been violated during the process.

Interim City Attorney Wynne Furth said she did not know of any violations.
The City granted a Conditional Use Permit (CUP) and the applicant had
appealed. The Planning and Transportation Commission (PTC) and Planning
Department determined the most effective manner to arrive at an agreeable
solution would be to outline a new CUP.

Council Member Freeman said no violations had been made during the
process.

Ms. Furth confirmed.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER that the motion include a request that the
Assistant City Manager return with a date certain for the hearing at the May
3, 2004, City Council meeting.

Council Member Cordell said she would like to have an indepth conversation
with someone in the Planning Department for clarification.

Council Member     Kishimoto   said   the   staff   report   (CMR:233:04)   was
confusing.

Council Member Freeman said there was an opportunity for a partnership to
emerge.

MOTION PASSED 6-0, Morton, Mossar, Ojakian absent.
