Council Member Freeman clarified the motion would not have failed, but
rather no action was taken.

Mayor Beecham said yes.

Mr. Benest said staff was concerned given the other major items facing
Council before the end of year. If the item were to come back, the public
hearing should be closed.

Council Member Morton said if the motion to continue the item did not pass,
he and Council Member Ojakian would request to reagendize the item.

Council Member Kishimoto requested clarification on the status of the project
if the motion to continue failed.

Mayor Beecham asked whether the Council was obligated to take action on
the item by a certain time.

Mr. Baum said under the Permanent Streamlining Act the Council would be;
however, under Council Protocols the project would be suspended if the
matter were continued.

Mayor Beecham asked if the Council became truly tied in any action and
thereby took no action, would that put them in any jeopardy that required
them to take action on the application.

Mr. Baum said, ultimately, the developer could bring an action in court to
comply action to be taken. It was a multi-step process that tended not to be
successful.

Council Member Kishimoto asked whether the status could be denial of the
project because of a failed majority.

Mr. Baum said in certain cities that rule applied; however, Palo Alto was not
one of them. Palo Alto did not have an ordinance deemed denied.

Council Member Cordell stated the Council took a vote that evening to deny
approval of the application, which failed on a 4-4 vote. The Council had not
taken a vote to approve the application on the assumption it too would fail,
but she believed that vote should be taken. If that motion failed on a 4-4
vote, then the Council would be in a position to say that no action had been
taken.
