know you went on to be class president as well. You've had the eye on this
prize for 20 years. That's commendable to have decided when you were
that young that you would go to Sacramento. You've done a great job.
Good luck, and come back and visit us. When we want something, we
presume that we know what the answer will be. Congratulations. We'll see
you on Tuesday, the 3rd.

Council Member Berman: Thank you, Liz.

Vice Mayor Scharff: Council Member Holman.

Council Member Holman: I'm going to take just a quick moment here of
personal privilege, if I might, to go back to the Comp Plan just for one
comment, something that I overlooked. It also gets very positive comment
in response from the public. That is creation of an arts district. I'll just
leave it at that right now, because I forgot to mention it earlier. I didn't see
it in the Comp Plan.

Vice Mayor Scharff: Did I miss anyone? I just have a couple of brief
comments. I was chosen to be Vice President of the personnel and finance
committee recently at ABAG and also was put on their committee that's
supposed to negotiate the merger agreement with Metropolitan
Transportation Commission (MTC). If you have any thoughts on that, tell
me. With that, meeting adjourned.

Mr. Keene: Mr. Mayor, just real quickly. Council Member Berman, it's been
a delight for the Staff to work with you, and we wish you the best. It goes
without saying we know you won't forget where you came from. We'll look
forward to working with you.

Council Member Berman: Thanks, Jim.         If you want to come with me to
Sacramento, I'm looking for staff.

Adjournment: The meeting was adjourned at 11:36 P.M.
