did not dictate an outcome. She thought that the language
diluted the intention of trying to get somewhere. They should
work toward community access. She said that it was almost
understood that if it could not be done that it would not be done.

Council Member Espinosa understood the intent but disagreed.
He thought it was dictating.        He said that it was not a
commentary on the recreational uses but he thought that the
reality of creating a joint statement was that they wanted to be
realistic about the fact that people from the outside would read
that you had to work toward a certain use as a mandate from the
Council. Putting that parameter “if possible,” or “where possible,”
provided the flexibility and still gave the clear intent of the
direction that they would like the conversation and decision
making to go.

Mayor Yeh asked for a straw vote on Guiding Principle Number
13. He said the proposed language was “PAUSD and the City
should work to continue community access to the extent
possible.” He said that a majority generally favored the
language.

Council Member Price said she was no longer proposing changes
to Guiding Principle Number 14.

Mayor Yeh said there was no change to Guiding Principle Number
14 or Number 15.

Council Member Holman suggested adding the following words to
Guiding Principle Number 15, “Transportation issues and access
to and within Cubberley shall be considered.”

Mayor Yeh said that he saw nods.

Council Member Price added “to serve current and future needs.”
