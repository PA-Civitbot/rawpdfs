 Francesca Freedman, 115 Everett Avenue, said she was opposed to the
 closures as she felt they fashioned a gated community using tax dollars for
 a select few.

 Janine Bisharat, 621 Hawthorne Avenue, said cut-through traffic would not
 be addressed with speed bumps and other alternatives. The majority of the
 residents wanted fewer cars in their neighborhood.

 Selora Albin, 660 Hawthorne Avenue, said her neighborhood was peaceful
 and safer with the barriers.

 Michael Ekoff, 621 Hawthorne Avenue, said over a period of ten years,
 there had been an escalation in traffic. As a result of the barriers, there
 had been a decline in traffic and speeding and an increase in bicycle and
 pedestrian traffic.

 Sam Sparck, 302 Poe Street, said the traffic-calming project had fulfilled its
 goal and requested it be made permanent with the changes the trial period
 had indicated as necessary.

 Lucilia Goulart Da Silva, 309 Poe Street, said the unusual high traffic in her
 neighborhood was disruptive and had a potentially negative environmental
 impact on San Francisquito Creek.

 Greg Chesson, 115 Waverley Street, said he wanted to support the
 Modified Mixed Measures Plan, which addressed the problems of nearby
 neighborhoods and overflow traffic.

 Dana De Nault, 311 Middlefield Road, said he was opposed to the trial and
 a new plan should be created to fix the process. The process used had not
 worked properly; the community was splintered and at odds with itself.

 Jim Lyttle, 117 Emerson Street, said Lytton Avenue could be an efficient
 cross-town artery with coordinated lights, making it an attractive
 thoroughfare.

 Nancy Adler, 109 Emerson Street, said the traffic-calming project was a
 failed plan.

 Bud Bellit, 109 Emerson Street, said instead of traffic calming, there was
 traffic stopping.
