STUDY SESSION

1.   Potential List of Topics for the Joint Meeting with the Human Relations
     Commission.

Chair O’Nan reviewed the role and Mission of the Human Relations
Commission (HRC). Three primary responsibilities were outlined in the
HRC's Charter: the Human Services Resource Allocation Program (HSRAP),
the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program, and the Palo
Alto Mediation (PAM) Program. Key accomplishments during the previous
year included evaluation of emerging needs in the City; simplification of the
HSRAP application process; funding allocation recommendations for HSRAP
and CDBG; and advocacy for additional HSRAP funding in the next fiscal
year. In addition, the HRC approved the appointment of new mediators to
the PAM Program; attended Question, Persuade and Refer (QPR) Suicide
Prevention Training; hosted the first regional breakfast for all HRCs in Santa
Clara County (County); and provided liaisons to Project Safety Net and the
Palo Alto Police Department Citizens Advisory Group. In order to become
more aware of and educated about community issues, the HRC instituted a
learning series on affordable housing; received a briefing from the Palo Alto
Police Department regarding crisis intervention training; co-sponsored Made
Into America; and recommended the Council endorse a Constitutional
amendment titled Corporations Are Not People and Money is Not Speech.
