     Council Member Morton asked if it would be possible for the Planning and
     Transportation Commission (P&TC) to change the location of a unit.

     Mr. Emslie stated the change could not reduce the number of units or
     housing type.

     for retail, community, and Below Market Rate (BMR) units.

     Council Member Morton asked whether the Council could amend the plans
     during the meeting.
