Council Member Drekmeier referred to the request to waive permit fees
for an on-site student film shoot in Palo Alto, and noted he supports the
request.

MOTION: Council Member Drekmeier moved, seconded by Mayor
Kleinberg, to direct staff to return to Council with a recommendation to
waive the permit costs for filming under the private/public partnership
policy.

Mayor Kleinberg asked when the filming was scheduled.

Ms. Harrison said she had the contact information for Mr. Engelhardt
and, hopefully, could turn the request around by the next scheduled
Council meeting.

Mayor Kleinberg said she understood the issue regarding setting a
precedence.

Ms. Harrison said Mr. Engelhardt was requesting waiver on the filming
fee and not requesting a waiver on fees relating to street closures and
police work.

Council Member Klein said he was not in favor of motions being acted
on during Council Comments. He said it was the third time in a year of
taking a motion under Council Comments, which was not consistent
with the Brown Act.

Mayor Kleinberg asked whether there was a protocol or regulations in
handing such matters, or was it by custom.

Mr. Baum said he would check, but he believes it is up to the Council.

Council Member Mossar said she concurred with Council Member Klein’s
comments in principle. She believed the motion was to ask staff to
come back to the Council with a recommendation. It was not directing
staff to do anything in particular and to leave open the possibility of the
staff to come back and refuse issuance of a waiver.

Ms. Harrison said she heard the Council’s request to bring the item
