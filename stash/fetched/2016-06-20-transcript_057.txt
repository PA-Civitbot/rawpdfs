Male: (inaudible)

Mayor Burt: There was already—you already proposed an amendment to
just eliminate the word "minor" improvements to Loma Verde, and that
wasn't accepted. I think it would have to be a Substitute Motion. Why don't
we go ahead and—we have a bunch of speakers. One, we need to look at
the clock. We need to try to truncate our discussion on this.

Council Member DuBois: Eric, did you propose "minor"?

Council Member Filseth: (inaudible) I'm happy to if you'd accept it.

Council Member DuBois: (inaudible)

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to remove from the Motion Part A, “minor.”

Council Member Filseth: I'm also happy to propose that Staff have the
latitude to consider a crossing at Loma Verde as well as East Meadow.

Council Member DuBois: I guess I'll allow that.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to add to the Motion Part B “or Loma Verde
Avenue” after “East Meadow Drive.”

Council Member Filseth: I'm less convinced on the issue of the dual thing
where you go down Loma Verde and then cut across on Ross to Matadero.
If it was me, I'd just keep riding down Loma Verde. It's straight.

Mayor Burt: When we do the full grade separations at East Meadow and
Charleston, they will have pedestrian separations. There's no need to have
this Midtown Corridor address that. That's just basically saying don't do
Loma Verde or put a emphasis on East Meadow instead of Loma Verde. It's
not in support of Loma Verde. I wouldn't support it as long as it asked to
have the focus on East Meadow. I will ...

Council Member Filseth: To the maker of the Motion, East Meadow seems
problematic to me too, because we're just going to do it again.
