Council Member Burt: (a)(2)(B).

Mayor Holman: (a)(2)(B).

Council Member Berman: (i) and (iii).

Mayor Holman: (i) and (iii).

Council Member Burt: That's compatibility goals.

Council Member Scharff: Yeah, that's fine.

Council Member Berman: Yep.

Council Member Burt: Then I have one other that I want them to consider.
These are not stipulative; these are focuses, foci. I want to make sure I get
this right or maybe Staff can help. It's on the third page of the context-
based design, at the bottom. It's a "B," and it's under a Section 2 but ...

Council Member Scharff: Sorry. Which page are you on?

Council Member Burt: The third page of the context ...

Council Member Scharff: Right, that's page 3.

Council Member Burt: At the bottom. It talks kind of the street face facades
and eaves and awnings and overhangs and porches. That section as well.

Mayor Holman: Council Member Scharff?

Council Member Scharff: I'm just trying to follow this. Maybe I'm on the
wrongâ€”it's page 3. It looks like this?

Council Member Berman: Is it the one below Figure 2.1?
