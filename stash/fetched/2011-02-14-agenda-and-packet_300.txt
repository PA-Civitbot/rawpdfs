II.      Council Meeting & Agenda Guidelines

         A. Policy. It is the policy of the Council to establish and follow a regular format for
         meeting agendas.

                    1. Purpose. The purpose of these guidelines is to facilitate the orderly and
                    efficient conduct of Council business. This purpose recognizes the value of
                    establishing a community understanding of meeting procedures so that broad
                    public participation is encouraged. This purpose also recognizes that
                    Council Members must have a common approach to the discussion and
                    debate of City business so that meetings are both streamlined and thorough.

                    2. Summary of Guidelines. The City Council generally conducts four




                                                                                                                  Attachment: 2.15.11 (1422 : Policy and Services Agenda 2/15/2011)
                    different kinds of meetings. These are Regular Meetings, Special Meetings,
                    Study Sessions, and Closed Sessions.

             Regular meetings are conducted at City Hall on the first three Monday nights of
         each month, except during the Council’s annual vacation. The meetings will begin
         at 7:00 p.m. Regular meeting agendas must be posted in the City Plaza by the
         elevators no later than 7:00 p.m. on the preceding Friday as required by the Brown
         Act. It is City policy to make every effort to complete and distribute the agenda and
         related reports by the preceding Wednesday. For major complex projects and
         policies, the City will make every effort to distribute these reports two weeks prior to
         the meeting when the item will be considered.

         Once the agenda is posted, it shall also be uploaded to the City Council web page for
         use by the public. It is City policy to make every effort to complete and distribute
         the agenda and related reports by the preceding Wednesday. For major, complex
         projects and policies, the City will make every effort to distribute these reports two
         weeks prior to the meeting when the item will be considered.

              Special meetings are “special” because the mayor or Council can call them on a
         minimum of 24 hours notice. Special meetings need not be held at City Hall, as long
         as the alternate location is within the City. The Council makes every effort to
         provide notice well in advance of 24 hours, especially when the special meeting is
         for the purpose of conducting a Study Session.

          Study Sessions are meetings during which the Council receives information
      about City business in an informal setting. The informal study session setting is
      intended to encourage in-depth presentations by City staff, and detailed questioning
      and brainstorming by Council. The Council may discuss the material freely without
      following formal rules of parliamentary procedure. Staff may be directed to bring
                                         ____
