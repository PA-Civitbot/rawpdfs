CLOSED SESSION

1.    CONFERENCE WITH REAL PROPERTY NEGOTIATORS
      Property: Santa Clara County Assessorâ€™s Parcel Number 182-46-006,
      Palo Alto
      Agency negotiator: Steve Emslie, Lalo Perez, Hamid Ghaemmaghami

Mayor Yeh announced that this closed session concerned a 7.7 acre parcel
identified as Santa Clara County APN: 182-46-006, located adjacent to
Foothills Park in Palo Alto, California. The parcel is located northeast of the
Los Trancos Road Subdivision; south of the Lee Subdivision and Arastradero
Preserve; and to the northwest of Palo Alto Foothills Park. There is no situs
address for the site. The parcel is landlocked and there are no public utilities
to the site. Other than through Foothills Park, access to the site is only
possible via a 40-foot-wide, non-public emergency ingress/egress easement
from Los Trancos Road, which crosses the 19.2-acre common area of the
adjacent Lee Subdivision.

Herb Borock opposed the sale of the property. The property provided
secondary and emergency egress from Foothills Park. The easement was
used for hiking and biking through the park. He provided maps of the area
to the Council and explained each one. The parcel provided a land bridge
between Foothills Park and the common area of the Lee Subdivision. It was
a mistake to dispose of the parcel.
