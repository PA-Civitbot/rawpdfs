UNFINISHED BUSINESS

10.   Approval of an Ordinance Amending the 2004-05 Budget to Add a
      Position of Senior Deputy City Attorney to the Table of Organization (Item
      continued from 10/25/04)



MOTION: Vice Mayor Burch moved, seconded by Morton, to approve the
staff request to adopt an ordinance amending the 2004-05 budget adding a
Senior Deputy City Attorney to the Table of Organization and approval of a
resolution amending the Compensation Plan. This position would be devoted
100 percent to Utilities legal services.

City Attorney Gary Baum stated if an attorney was hired by January 2005,
an additional six months of services and preventative law would be provided
by the City Attorney’s Department.

Council Member Freeman requested to add an annual report with a
comparison of funds saved from Utilities compared to funds spent on the
position.

Mr. Baum said savings probably would not be shown the first year.             A
substantial savings would be shown in the long-term goal.

Council Member Freeman asked whether an annual report could be provided.

Mr. Baum said if the Council wished, an annual report could be provided.

Mayor Beecham said a Council Member had requested the report, not the
Council.   He asked Council Member Freeman whether she wanted to
incorporate the request.

Council Member Freeman said she would like to request to incorporate an
annual report as a fiscal review.

Vice Mayor Burch said he wanted to get the motion approved and deny the
request to incorporate. He did not want anything added to the request for a
report.

Mayor Beecham said Council Member Freeman’s request was to have the
City Attorney return annually and advise what the savings were on the
position.
