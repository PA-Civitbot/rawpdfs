Council Member Burt recalled that in the prior discussion the Council
received information regarding the number of cars removed from the road as
a result of BRT and the number of vehicles displaced by reduction in
capacity.

Mr. Ristow had summarized the results of VTA's analysis of traffic impacts
from a dedicated bus lane. That information was contained within the EIR.

Council Member Burt inquired whether the net amount between the number
of cars removed from the road and the decreased amount of capacity on El
Camino Real was readily available.

Mr. Ristow indicated it was contained in the EIR.

Mr. Rodriguez had not extracted relevant data from the EIR.           That
information would be presented along with the comment letter.

Council Member Burt asked if Staff had an analysis of the degree of loss of
level of service.

Mr. Rodriguez had not compared the prior analysis with the new analysis.
He would provide that information with the comment letter.

Council Member Burt asked if Staff would analyze the different levels of
numbers of trains per hour and impacts that would occur on roadway level of
service degradation in conjunction with dedicated lanes.

Mr. Rodriguez could perform that analysis.

Council Member Burt inquired when Staff would return with the comment
letter.

Mr. Rodriguez answered most likely January 12, 2015.

Mayor Shepherd reiterated that the comment deadline was January 14,
2015.

Council Member Burt remarked that Staff would not have much time to
revise the comment letter according to Council comments on January 12.

Mayor Shepherd advised that the draft comment letter would be provided in
the Council packet released approximately ten days prior to the meeting.

Council Member Burt asked if alternatives would include such items as other
means to improve ridership.
