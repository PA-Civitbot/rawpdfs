Herb Borock, P.O. Box 632, spoke on the bike library program, the cost and
storage.

Bill Burton, P.O. Box 4343, Aracata, spoke on the bike library program,
recycled bikes, auto-tracking of bikes, one bike station and the ability to
scale upwards.

Mayor Klein stated the Motion is to direct staff to evaluate the idea, and not
a proposal for a rental bike program, and Mr. Burton’s proposal was
background information at this point.

Council Member Kishimoto agreed there is no overnight success in such a
program and it would need public education and build-out.

Council Member Morton asked if they could expect to hear something back in
October. He was willing to ask staff to study it if there was an appropriate
timeframe.

Council Member Espinosa asked what an appropriate timeframe would be.

City Manager Frank Benest stated an evaluation could be done of a generic
program, with resource impacts done by the Transportation Division, and
they could return to Council after the break.

AMENDMENT: Council Member Burt moved, seconded by Council Member
Kishimoto that Staff’s priorities are as follows; first is to focus on a program
to serve commuters, second is to evaluate other revenue sources, and third
is for the City’s subsidy to be a moderate subsidy.

Council Member Kishimoto asked if commuters meant people commuting by
bike, or people who worked in the City.

Council Member Burt stated this would be workers in the City.

Council Member Kishimoto stated she was not talking about bike commuters.

Council Member Burt stated they would become hybrid commuters.

Council Member Kishimoto clarified they would get to the City in some other
way prior to renting the bikes. She stressed the importance of looking into
alternative revenue sources.

Council Member Espinosa suggested giving priority focus to commuters in
the program.
