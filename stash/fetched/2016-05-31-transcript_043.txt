                           TRANSCRIPT
Mayor Burt: I didnâ€™t even see him. (inaudible) Public Safety.        I'm just
questioning whether we had any Council items that were related.

Council Member Wolbach: Actually there's one.

Mayor Burt: What is that?

Council Member Schmid: Seven is listed as Police.

Council Member Wolbach: Also, 61 is Police Department (PD) and Office of
Emergency Services (OES). That's means restrictions.

Mayor Burt: We've got the Public Safety Building.

Mr. Keene: I think we can handle Animal Shelter, 7. What was the other
one? I heard the Police, but the other number.

Council Member Wolbach: Sixty-one is Police Department and OES, means
restrictions.

Mr. Keene:   I can speak to that also.   We're on the team, when the time
comes.

Mayor Burt: Council Member DuBois, did you ...

Council Member DuBois: Continuing on Page 6 which is where Fire was.
The IT items, I think, are both green.

Mayor Burt: Does anybody have any IT-related issues they want to raise?

Council Member Holman: Does that mean we're done with Police?

Mayor Burt: Actually ...

Council Member Holman: I wasn't.

Mayor Burt: Let me just say that the Police-related matters, the City
Manager said that those, I think, three that we identified, we could contend
with outside of Police. We actually skipped over Police. Let me do IT first,
and then give you an opportunity on Police since we're now on the IT. I
don't want to go back and forth. Anyone have anything on IT that they want
to raise? That one's resolved. Council Member Holman, you had something
on Police.

Mr. Keene: Jonathan, (inaudible).

Council Member Holman: Is Dennis around? Do we want Dennis here?
