Vice Mayor Kniss: That one.

Mayor Scharff: … the first one. I see a bunch of lights. My bad. I didn't
realize we suddenly had all these lights. Back to the main Motion. Council
Member Holman, did you put your light on?

Council Member Holman: I did. I want to steal whoever said it, maybe
Council Member Filseth.       Persons who have already applied would be
included in the pool of candidates, and they'd be given the option of whether
they would like to be interviewed again or not.

Mayor Scharff: I would second that. We'll just put that in there.

Vice Mayor Kniss: I think that was Fine's suggestion or Tanaka, one of those
two.

Mayor Scharff: You can put it in there.

Council Member Holman: If Tanaka would accept that as an Amendment?

Council Member Tanaka: I accept it.

Council Member Fine: I'd also accept that.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to add to the Motion, “and retain current pool of
applicants and permit current applicants to interview with Council again, if
they so choose.”

Mayor Scharff: We have that. That was Council Member Holman. Council
Member Fine.

Council Member Holman: Just a second.

Mayor Scharff: You have more.

Council Member Holman: This is only capturing so far part of it. It's permit
current applicants to (inaudible) we want to keep the current pool of
candidates. We want to retain the current pool of candidates and permit
current applicants to interview with Council again if they so choose. That
gets it.

Mayor Scharff: You're good, Council Member Holman? Council Member
Fine. You're good. Council Member Tanaka. You're good. Council Member
Filseth. Going on this side, Council Member DuBois.
