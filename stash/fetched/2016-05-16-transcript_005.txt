at the red outline here, you can see that this is a large parcel. It's unique in
that way in Downtown. What's highlighted in blue is an anecdotal survey
that myself and my staff, as we've walked these neighborhoods, have kind

ingredient in this, we want to understand what that figure (inaudible) looks
like and what's in the neighborhood. It points to us that this site is ripe for
housing. As Brad showed you before, this is broken up into two portions, so
commercial here. The existing outline of that box is the existing footprint.
We're diminishing the presence of commercial space on Hamilton and
bringing forth the residential edge on Webster. These site sections begin to
get at the question of scale and compatibility. You'll see in this packet that
we've taken care to be both within the existing zoning limit, but also
underneath the existing building that's there as well. Just quickly finishing

Male: Thank you.

recognition by the Chair before speaking.

Male: Apologies.

Mayor Burt: Let's return to the Council for questions and comments. Who
would like to go first? Council Member Kniss.

Council Member Kniss: I spent some time at the site a couple of days ago.
One of the things thatâ€”is the applicant close by? Where did you go? Just to
ask you a couple of questions about this. It says three stories, 58 feet tall.
Is it actually 58 feet?

Mr. Zirkle: Are you talking about the existing structure?

Council Member Kniss: Uh-huh.
