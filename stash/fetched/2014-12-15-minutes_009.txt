Ms. Stump clarified that if the Council voted to continue Agenda Item
Number 22 at the current time, it would be continued to a later date.

Mayor Shepherd preferred to discuss continuation within the order of the
Agenda.

Council Member Holman noted the Council received an email from the
President of the California Avenue Business Association.

Mayor Shepherd stated discussion was not allowed at the current time, but
could be held when Agenda Item 22 was reached on the Agenda.

Council Member Holman noted neither she nor Council Member Burt, maker
and seconder of the Motion, were allowed to address the Motion.

Mayor Shepherd wanted to postpone the vote on the Motion until Agenda
Item 22 was reached in the order of the Agenda in order to hold a
discussion.

James Keene, City Manager, concurred with awaiting the item in the Agenda
so that Staff could clarify what had happened prior to the Council
rescheduling the item.

Mayor Shepherd tabled the item until its natural order on the Agenda.

Oral Communications

Jim Wang reported the Planning Department spent a great deal of time
meeting with him; however, the Planning Department took no action to
proactively address the issues of privacy, noise and odor.

Robert Moss thanked Mayor Shepherd and Council Members Klein and Price
for their service on the Council. They worked to improve the City and the
community.

Lisa Henderickson introduced Amy Andonian as the next President and Chief
Executive Officer of Avenidas.

Amy Andonian looked forward to working with the community and
continuing Avenidas' work in the community.

Ronna DiVincenzi appreciated the improvements being made to California
Avenue. The crosswalks were much safer. However, pedestrians along the
sidewalk were suffering lacerations from the glass in the exposed aggregate.
The new sidewalks were slippery when wet and collected dirt.
