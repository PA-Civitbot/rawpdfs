Mr. Van Orsdol said the 5 percent reduction challenge was issued to each
department and several departments came up with greater than the 5
percent reduction. Each department came up with their own solution in
assessing cost effectiveness in reducing emissions.

Council Member Klein said the denominator was reduced for the City’s share
of the total community greenhouse gases. He had concerns as to whether
the City was meeting the goal on the basis of the new denominator.

Mr. Van Orsdol said the challenge was 3,025 metric tonnes and the 7,000
metric tonnes would be achieved through the plan.

Council Member Klein raised concerns regarding offsets and felt they did not
always work. He asked what the cost was on offsets.

Mr. Van Orsdol said renewable energy credit fluctuated from $1 to $5.

Council Member Klein asked what was the cost on renewable energy credits.

Mayor Drekmeier said approximately one and half cent per kilowatt hour.

Resource Planner, Shiva Swaminathan said they were not offsets but were
renewable energy certificates and were environmental attributes associated
to wind and solar photovoltaic (PV).

Council Member Klein asked what the numbers were if there were no offsets.

Mr. Van Orsdol said the numbers were reflected in Staff Report CMR:213:09,
Table 1, column titled: “2009 Expected Emissions (metric tonnes of C02e)”
as 24,841 metric tonnes of C02 WHKH and achieved an 11 percent reduction
or approximately 6 percent reduction over the original estimate. The energy
savings for 12-months would be over $2 million if the forecasted plan was
achieved.

Council Member Burt asked what percentage of the City’s C02’s as a
community was coming from gas and electricity usage.

Mr. Van Orsdol said 300,000 metric tonnes or approximately 45 percent.

Council Member Burt said there was a 50 percent water use increase in 2007
versus 2008.
