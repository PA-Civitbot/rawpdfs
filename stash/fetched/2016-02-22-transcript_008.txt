Council Member Kniss: I will weigh in again. I think the Minutes we
currently have are frankly useless except for seeing who made the Motion,
what may have been added to it. There is no substance whatsoever to it. I
know Tom and I both have regretted this before, and I'm regretting it again.
I think we should have Minutes that are at least substantive.

Mayor Burt: For a process to address that, I think we have our annual
review of policies and procedures. It's within that, is that correct, Beth? Is
the Minute frequency part of the policy and procedures?

Beth Minor, City Clerk: No, it's not.

Mayor Burt: This would take a Colleagues Memo to reconsider or ...

Council Member Kniss: I think it does.

Ms. Minor: Correct.

Mayor Burt: That would be the process.

Molly Stump, City Attorney: Mr. Mayor, it's in the Municipal Code. It could
be amended by Ordinance.

Mayor Burt: That would be the necessary process to address it. All those in
favor, please vote on the board. That passes unanimously.

MOTION PASSED: 9-0
