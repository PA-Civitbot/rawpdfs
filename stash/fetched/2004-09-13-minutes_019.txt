and she would support the substitute motion.

Council Member Freeman asked whether the $400,000 loss on the lease
would come from the General Fund.

Mr. Yeats said during the ten-year proposed lease, the current proposed
debt service was approximately $320,000 per year. Over the life of the
lease, Form Fitness had proposed to pay approximately $2.8 million in rent
payments, which would graduate over time.

Council Member Freeman said the City was leasing the property with the
knowledge it would be losing money.

Mr. Yeats confirmed.

Council Member Freeman said although she did not believe it was a good
arrangement for the City, the Council had made a decision.

Vice Mayor Burch said the original commitment was to use lease income for
teen programs since their space had been removed.

Council Member Kleinberg said although the process had not been perfect,
the Council should move forward with the lease to Form Fitness.

Council Member Morton said there was a capital investment differential up
front, which offset the rent differential between the restaurant and Form
Fitness.

Mayor Beecham said an honest effort was made to get the best bid.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION PASSED 6-3, Burch, Freeman, Ojakian no.
