Vice Mayor Kniss asked if Peckham & McKenney was the only firm not
presently performing recruitment for the City.

Ms. Shen clarified that Bob Murray & Associates had responded to the
Request for Proposal, but had not returned her phone call.

Mayor Shepherd asked if Peckham & McKenney was an offshoot of another
firm.

Ms. Shen stated Peckham & McKenney had been their own firm for 17 years.

Council Member Klein noted he and Chair Scharff agreed the Council
Appointed Officer’s Committee (Committee) should interview the three firms.

Ms. Shen believed that could be arranged and Staff had inquired of their
availability for this meeting; it was too short of a timeframe for them to
appear.

Council Member Klein clarified the interview could be in person or via Skype.

Mayor Shepherd felt the prior work with Bob Murray & Associates as well as
Ralph Andersen & Associates was sufficient knowledge of their abilities, but
not being familiar with Peckham & McKenney an interview would be
warranted.

Council Member Klein agreed; although, a brief interview comparing their
efforts between other recruitments and the City Clerk recruitment would be
beneficial.

Vice Mayor Kniss had concerns with Bob Murray & Associates not returning
Staff’s call. She was satisfied moving forward with Peckham & McKenney.

Mayor Shepherd asked if Vice Mayor Kniss was familiar with the recruitment
processes and style of Peckham & McKenney.

Vice Mayor Kniss stated no, she was basing her decision on Staff’s research
and recommendation.

Council Member Klein believed an interview of at least Peckham & McKenney
was warranted since none of the Committee members were familiar with
them.
