Council Member Lytle said she did not understand the answer about legal
redundancy. She asked where was the legal redundancy on adding a
guideline about being environmentally sensitive as staff implemented the
WIRP.

Council Member Kleinberg said she did not believe CEQA was merely a
document requiring revelation. It was also a document that required
mitigation of environmental problems. Therefore, it was more of a regulatory
act. When you chose to state a matter that was already the law in some
cases and not in other cases it became a potential problem. At those times
when it was not stated, it could be said then it did not apply.
Council Member Burch said that although he understood what was being
asked, he did not believe there was a need for it. He was opposed to the
substitute motion.

Vice Mayor Beecham opposed the substitute motion.

Mayor Mossar opposed the substitute motion.

MOTION PASSED 8-1, Freeman “no.”
