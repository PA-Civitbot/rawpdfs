    Transportation Commission will not be advocated by the VTA. There had
    been a proposal to redirect federal funds awarded to Palo Alto for the
    California Avenue Project. They would need an option to redirect those
    funds, and they have prepared two motions for the VTA board to redirect
    the funds to the Highway 101 project for sound walls.

    ADJOURNMENT: The meeting was adjourned at 11:02 P.M.
