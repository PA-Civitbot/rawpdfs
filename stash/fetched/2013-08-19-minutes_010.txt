                       WORKING MINUTES

Council Member Holman indicated the Residential Density Bonus and Appeals
of a Director's Approval were complex and should not be discussed at the
end of a long Council meeting.

Council Member Klein noted the reasons for continuing Agenda Items 14 and
17 were that Staff received calls from Council Members and the public did
not have sufficient time to review the information. The Planning and
Transportation Commission (P&TC) held numerous meetings on both issues.
The issues deserved additional study, but the public should have voiced their
concerns prior to the Council referring it to the Regional Housing Mandate
Committee.
