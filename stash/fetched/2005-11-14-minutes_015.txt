Council Member Freeman asked whether there was an issue with how
the item was agendized.

City Attorney Gary Baum said since the zone change would not take
place that evening, the Council was being asked to request staff to
bring the item to the P&TC.

Council Member Freeman said Exhibit A-21.9 of the staff report
(CMR:419:05) indicated Arastradero Road was part and parcel of the
property. She asked whether it was a part of the open space.

Manager Open Space and Sciences Greg Betts said yes. The Bressler
Property did extend across the road and included Arastradero Road. He
clarified other roads, such as Embarcadero Road in the Baylands,
Foothills Park, Las Trampas Valley Road, and Madera Point Hill
incorporated roads that were part of open space parks.

Council Member Freeman asked whether the portion of the Bressler
Property not part of the Arastradero Road right-of-way was included.

Mr. Betts said the entire parcel of property including the right-of-way
would be incorporated into park land. It was not broken up in any way.

Council Member Freeman asked the whether the change in the Comp
Plan Use Map would occur after the commission reviewed it.
Mr. Baum said it would follow to the extent necessary.

Council Member Kishimoto said it was important that staff notice
agenda items carefully because often the agenda was the only thing
the public saw.

Mayor Burch said the agenda indicated the park land dedication.

Council Member Kishimoto said the agenda did not indicate a
recommendation to initiate a zone change.

MOTION PASSED 9-0.
