Mark Tortorich, Vice President of Planning Design and Construction for
Stanford Hospital, gave a presentation for the Medical Center.

Jean McCown, Stanford University Director of Community Relations,
requested the Council consider the existing language in the City’s
Comprehensive Plan regarding the Medical Center. Her concern is that the
expansion of the area plan geographically and in scope could create a delay
of the process. She asked the Council to be open to how the identified
objectives are applied until the EIR is prepared with broader public input.
