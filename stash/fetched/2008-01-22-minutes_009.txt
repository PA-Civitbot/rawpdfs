Mr. Emslie stated the property was located on the Dinah side of the project.

Council Member Morton asked if there was some way to preserve the
eventual bike path.

Mr. Emslie stated the Applicant had proposed that location to be a public
access area.

Council Member Morton stated yes, however that would not grant access
from Wilkie Way to El Camino Real.

Mr. Emslie stated the public would get to the park and exit through Deodar
Street which was a public access street.

Council Member Schmid inquired on the statement made at a Planning &
Transportation Commission (P&TC) meeting regarding the proposed public
access easement would be discussed further in the review of the next
tentative map. He stated it seemed in the P&TC meeting the map discussion
was for the easement of Wilkie Way.

Planning & Transportation Commissioner Lee Lippert stated the discussion
did not include a housing proposal.

Council Member Schmid stated there was a block of funds for park
dedications and asked whether a portion of those funds could be used to
purchase an easement on the Dinah side.

Mr. Emslie stated yes, park dedication funds could be used to purchase
public right-of-way for recreation and access purposes.

Mr. Baum stated he would research the terms of the fee collection to verify
the usage ability.

Council Member Kishimoto clarified during the Architectural Review Board
(ARB) meeting that took place in November 2007, it had been mentioned
approval was vested but what had not been reviewed yet was the tentative
condominium map.

Mr. Emslie stated yes, the current discussion was the first of the two maps
coming to the Council.

Council Member Kishimoto asked at what time would there be discussion of
the layout of the public streets within each development.
