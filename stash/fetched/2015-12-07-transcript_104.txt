Council Member Berman: Mayor Holman? Sorry ...

Mayor Holman: Council Member Berman.

Council Member Berman: ... I wasn't sure if you were finished.

Council Member DuBois: Just my last comment. I support the rest of the
changes. It's just these ARB findings that I find to be kind of a lot.

Council Member Berman: That's kind of exactly what I was going to ask.
Mayor Holman, if you're okay with Sections 22 and 24, then maybe we could
change the substitute Motion to just an amendment to remove Section 23,
and we can move forward with our evening.

Mayor Holman: Yes, that actually was my intention. I hadn't looked up at
the screen to see what was captured. My only intention was to take out
Section 18.76.020, architectural review, and approve the rest of it.

Vice Mayor Schmid: Yeah, that's what (inaudible).

Council Member Berman: Council Member Scharff, are you okay with that?

Mayor Holman: Vice Mayor Schmid, are you okay with that?

Vice Mayor Schmid: Yeah.

Council Member Scharff: Yeah.

Council Member Berman: I am too.

Mayor Holman:    That's an amendment to the main Motion then, to
continue—I keep trying to find it here—Section 18.76.020, architectural
review.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to add to the Motion, “to continue Municipal Code
Section 18.76.020 to the next available meeting.

Mayor Holman: Waiting for the Clerk here.       That is Section 23, to be
redundant there.

MOTION RESTATED: Council Member Scharff moved, seconded by Council
Member Berman to approve Ordinance Sections 22 and 24, modifying
Municipal Code Chapters 18.70-18.77 with the exception of Municipal Code
Section 18.76.020.
