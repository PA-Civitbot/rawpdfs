position because there are a number of situations where the officers’ lives
could be at risk but they would still want the Tasers.

Council Member Cordell asked on page 3 of the protocol, on section 308.A5
on Taser Usage, it stated, “Generally, a subject fleeing should not be the
sole justification for use of an Electronic Control Device (ECD). Severity of
the offenses and other circumstances should be considered before officers’
use an ECD on a fleeing subject.” She had concerns on “other
circumstances” and “severity of the offenses” being too vague.

Assistant City Attorney Don Larkin stated that sentence was taken right out
of the case law.

Council Member Cordell stated she wanted more specificity.

Ms. Johnson asked that different types of situations be covered in the
training.

Council Member Cordell asked in the situation of a shoplifter lunging at an
officer, would a Taser be used.

Ms. Johnson replied yes if the person was presenting a potential danger to
the officer.

Council Member Drekmeier stated the public has access to Tasers, which
may put officers at risk.

Ms. Johnson replied yes there was on-line access to stun guns, which are
600,000 volts that any person could purchase. If the stun gun were used on
someone randomly, it would be illegal. However, if you were defending
yourself, it would be considered legal.

Council Member Drekmeier asked whether there was a regulation on this.

Ms. Johnson replied no.

Council Member Drekmeier asked whether the City could create a regulation.

Ms. Johnson stated it could be created similar to gun laws, but people
coming into Palo Alto may not abide by it.

Council Member Drekmeier asked for more information on the use of force
statistics in Palo Alto.
