Mr. Emslie stated the legislation did allow the agency to factor in water
conservation measures to meet the demand.

Council Member Burt stated there were different interpretations of the
language and asked whether there was a trial court ruling to determine the
interpretations.

Ms. Silver stated yes, there was a combination of legislation and published
case law.

Council Member Burt stated with approval of the project exceeded the
demand capacity. He asked how conservation measures, allowed a project to
meet that demand.

Ms. Silver stated the Council was a Legislative Body and they had the ability
to deem the level of conservation.

Council Member Burt asked whether the level of conservation could apply
citywide or directed to a project.

Ms. Silver stated the Council determined the direction of the conservation
and to what level.

Council Member Burt stated new projects had a higher level of opportunity
to conserve water than existing ones. He stated the report referred to
Stanford Medical Center water conservation measures and the Shopping
Center having a program of conservation without quantification. He asked
whether the conservation program included the retrofit of the existing
shopping and new portions of the center.

Ms. Silver stated there was an outdoor irrigation component to the program
which applied to the existing areas.

Council Member Burt asked why the shopping center was not required to
implement comparable measures to the medical center.

Mr. Emslie stated the review of the shopping center was not complete and
he could not say the measures would not be the same.

Council Member Burt asked why the process was before Council for approval
when the project had not been reviewed with adequate data.

Mr. Emslie stated the process was a matter of legality, this process needed
to be approved prior to the release of the EIR.
