                      DRAFT MINUTES
Mayor Yeh said that the original language was “Cubberley
programs enrich the community and criteria should be developed
to prioritize existing uses and assess prospective new uses.”

Council Member Burt suggested they say “prioritize uses.”

Mayor Yeh suggested that all Council Members should give their
input on possible language for Guiding Principle Number 10. He
stated he had no changes for Guiding Principle Number 11. The
suggested change to Guiding Principle Number 12 was “The City
Council representatives on the CPAC shall bring back the
frequency of the CPAC meetings following the first CPAC meeting
and report the frequency of regular reports to the full Council on
Cubberley planning activities.” He said that did not capture
everything. He said, “The Mayor shall bring back the frequency
of CPAC and report on the frequency of reports to the full Council
on Cubberley planning activities.”

Council Member Klein said that they did not need to be that
complicated. The concerns would be satisfied if they said, “The
City Council representatives on the CPAC shall provide regular
reports, not less often than bi-monthly, to the full Council on
Cubberley planning activities.”

Mayor Yeh said that the proposed language was “not less often
than bi-monthly, to the full Council on Cubberley planning
activities.”

Council Member Klein said bi-monthly was once every two
months. He said the wording should be semi-monthly.

Mayor Yeh asked for other comments on Guiding Principle
Number 12. He thought the challenge was that the CPAC had not
yet set the frequency of its meetings. He asked Council Members
who were not on the CPAC for their thoughts. He said that
monthly was proposed.
