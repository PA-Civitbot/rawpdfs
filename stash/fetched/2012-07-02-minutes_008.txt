5.    Public Hearing: Discussion and Direction Regarding City Policy for the
      Use of Utility Substation Sites, City Hall and Other City Property for
      Siting Wireless Communications Facilities (continued from June 25,
      2012, Public Hearing closed).

Curtis Williams, Director of Planning and Community Environment recalled
this Item was continued from the June 25, 2012 meeting, because of Council
concerns regarding the language of Staff recommendations. Staff had
broadened the recommendation to be generic with regard to the
development of a wireless plan, and included the list of details for a Request
for Proposal (RFP) in the discussion item rather than the general
recommendation.

Council Member Klein inquired whether a representative of AT&T was
present.

Mr. Williams answered no.

Council Member Klein noted receipt of a letter from AT&T and, based on that
letter, felt AT&T would not be cooperative. He asked if Staff had discussed
AT&T's interest.

Mr. Williams indicated Staff had discussed the issue with AT&T
approximately six months ago. AT&T stated its antennas would need to be
less than 100 feet tall. He responded to AT&T that antennas for its system
could be lower than 125 feet, but Staff would need more analysis to
determine that. AT&T would wait for the analysis, and indicated it was not
legally bound to use City towers.

Council Member Klein inquired whether AT&T had a firm rule for the height
of towers.

James Keene, City Manager said Staff could not speak to AT&T's intentions.
AT&T would proceed with other distributed antenna system (DAS)
installations in the City, even if the City constructed towers.
