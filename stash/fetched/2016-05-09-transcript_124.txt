                         TRANSCRIPT
C.   Implement an RPP in Evergreen Park through a stakeholder process
     including parking management options and determining how many
     permits to be sold for low income workers as well as retail and
     personal service workers from the adjacent California Avenue district;
     and

D.   Recommend that the Crescent Park neighborhood be added to the
     Downtown RPP eligibility area and if the neighborhood is not annexed,
     the residents can come back as the third priority for a separate RPP;
     and

E.   Edgewood Plaza would be fourth priority; and

F.   Direct Staff to explore options including sharing permits so that low
     income workers as well as retail and personal service employees can
     afford permits.
