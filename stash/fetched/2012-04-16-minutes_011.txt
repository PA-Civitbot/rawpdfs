therefore it was agendized as an Action Item in case there was a change
from the Finance Committee’s recommendation. He said Staff had placed
before Council a memorandum dated April 16, 2012 with the title
“Information Pertaining to Fiscal Year 2012 Midyear Budget Amendment
Ordinance (BAO).” The Electric Fund had a Capital Improvement Project
(CIP) for customer connections. The CIP was recommended to be closed
down with a balance of $1 million returned to reserves because there were
fewer connections than anticipated. Since the submittal of the midyear
request and its approval by the Finance Committee a major business in town
decided to move its expansion at a faster scale than originally projected. In
order to accommodate the expansion Staff requested that the Council allow
them to retain $500,000 of the $1 million in the Electric Fund and return the
remaining $500,000 to reserves. He said that also increased revenue as the
majority of the connection fee was reimbursed, noting that Staff had to front
the cost.
