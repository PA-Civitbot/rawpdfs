Ms. Morariu stated if the Motion was approved, Staff would move forward
with the implementation of the Foothills Fire Management Plan, and
reallocate existing funds as part of the budget process to support the Priority
One recommendation.

Council Member Kishimoto inquired whether there was funding allocated for
Priority One.

Ms. Morariu stated no.

Council Member     Kishimoto   requested    clarification on the           two
recommendations from the Parks and Recreation Commission (PARC).

Ms. Morariu stated the two PARC recommendations were part of Priority
One.     The Adaptive Management recommendation would evaluate the
Foothills Fire Management Plan to determine efficiency and address
unanticipated results. Allocation of funding toward a biologist, to review
proposed work prior to the initiation of any treatment, was the second
recommendation.

Council Member Kishimoto stated road clearance would be limited to 10-30
feet.

Mr. Deuker stated road clearance would be reviewed on a base-by-base
basis.

Council Member Schmid inquired whether the base proposal was to clear-cut
330 acres.

Mr. Deuker stated the initial proposal did not include clear-cutting. There
were a variety of treatment methods including mowing, grazing, and
weeding.

Council Member Schmid stated the proposed treatment methods could
potentially change the environment. It was his belief that adopting the
Motion would send a message that may change the experience of Foothills
Park. He inquired whether the protection of Foothills Park was discussed by
the PARC.

Interim Director of Community Services, Greg Betts stated discussions on
open space reserves were the primary element of Foothills Park
stakeholders. He clarified there was no suggestion of clear-cutting. He
spoke on a treatment method of mulching using specialized equipment that
proved to be beneficial.
