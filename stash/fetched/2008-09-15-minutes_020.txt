not habitable, and less than seven feet in height.

Vice Mayor Drekmeier asked whether it counted if it was used for building
utilities.

Mr. Williams stated it would without the Design Enhancement Exceptions
(DEE), which was what they were requesting. The Applicant was proposing
to use that space for essentially mechanical equipment needs and not office
or other space. He stated it would not be counted if it was seven feet or
less.

Vice Mayor Drekmeier asked if it needed to be brought up to code in order to
be used.

Mr. Williams stated yes, the new construction would have to be to the
current code requirement of eight feet in access for height.

Council Member Burt stated the project forced Council to face a number of
issues. He asked if there were any examples of an FAR and a whole floor
being allowed or a significant height exemption under a DEE.

Mr. Williams stated he did not believe so and that this was not a floor. Sixty
percent of the structure was habitable space but not an architectural
element.

Council Member Burt asked why this portion of the project came as a
Variance rather than a DEE which was intended for minor architectural
elements.

Mr. Williams stated there were strong design reasons.

Council Member Burt asked if the staff had made any estimate on equipment
and whether or not they needed the entire basement to house it.

Mr. Williams stated they had no specifics on that and there were no
conditions restricting the use.

Council Member Burt stated that beyond the DEE, he was more interested in
whether or not they should allow basements for other purposes in trying to
enhance street level retail. He suggested this might be considered on a
policy basis. He asked if an area was exempted would there be an impact
fee required for that area.

Mr. Williams stated he would check on the impact fee language.
