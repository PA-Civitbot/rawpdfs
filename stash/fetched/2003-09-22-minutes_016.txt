Council Member Morton said once a performance measure became an
official document, they were literally interpreted. He was concerned a
set of performance standards would get adopted and would not be
achievable.

Council Member Ojakian said his concerns were when guidelines and
ideas were talked about they would end up coming back as law. Items
3 through 9 provided relief. He wanted the record to show that the
Council had indicated they were not precluding or presupposing certain
factors based on future developments in the Corridor.

Council Member Burch said the word “any” concerned him.

Vice Mayor Beecham said the measures told how well the objectives
were met.

Council Member Kishimoto said the City could reverse the long-term
negative trend the City had been in.

Council Member Freeman said the problem was traffic. The goal was
to hold, and possibly reduce, the traffic the study had precipitated.

Council Member Kleinberg said what was happening that evening was
measuring, not restricting and prohibiting. Safety in the community
was the number one responsibility.

Mayor Mossar asked staff if it changed their work if Measures 1 and 2
said “no increase” or “minimize increase.”

Mr. Emslie said it would not change the nature of the work.

Mayor Mossar confirmed with Mr. Emslie that one word or the other
would result in the same work product and decision-making process.

AMENDMENT: Council Member Morton moved, seconded by Ojakian,
to amend Performance Measures 1 and 2 of Attachment A to state
“minimize increase” rather than “no increase.”

AMENDMENT FAILED 7-2, Morton, Ojakian “yes.”

Council Member Burch said he wanted an amendment to remove the
word “any” out of the final motion.
