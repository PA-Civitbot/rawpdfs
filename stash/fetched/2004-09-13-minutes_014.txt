Norman Carroll, Emerson Street and University Avenue, said he did not
agree with dedicating $250,000 to enhance Lytton Plaza when it could be
upgraded for less.

Herb Borock, P.O. Box 632, said the proposal violated the Charter provisions
for use of dedicated parkland.

Elaine Meyer, 609 Kingsley Avenue, said the design of Lytton Plaza made it a
functional public plaza where individuals of all ages congregated.

MOTION: Vice Mayor Burch moved, seconded by Morton, to direct staff to
review the proposal for Lytton Plaza and to bring a recommendation back to
the Council. Specifically, for staff to return with:
•     Verification of Established cost estimates
•     Recommendation on potential funding options
•     Possible implementation timeline, including staff and board and
      commission review process

Vice Mayor Burch said the cost of the renovation needed to be defined.

Council Member Morton said he had concerns about an open fountain in the
plaza.

Council Member Ojakian said he would like feedback on the project from the
individuals who were part of the Downtown Urban Design Improvement Plan.
The Park and Recreation Commission (PARC) should review the current
proposal.

Council Member Cordell asked whether a design already existed for the Plaza
and asked about the 1997 proposed design improvements.

Mayor Beecham said there was a preliminary sketch.

Council Member Cordell asked whether the City had generated the designs.

Mayor Beecham said it was currently a concept. The concept would be sent
to the appropriate boards and commissions for input, it would be sent on to
staff, then back to the Council for a final decision.

Council Member Cordell asked whether the Council would see the sketch
prior to making a recommendation.

Council Member Mossar said a concept existed.
