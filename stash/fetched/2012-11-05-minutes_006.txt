Council Member Holman inquired whether the Council could review the Noise
Ordinance in response to Agenda Item Number 11; Appeal of Director’s
Architectural Review Approval of the Collocation by AT&T Mobility LLC, or
whether the Council would need to take separate action.

Ms. Stump explained Agenda Item Number 11 was an appeal from a
Director's decision on a particular application. The potential amendment or
adoption of a new Noise Ordinance was a legislative action and should be
noticed and discussed separately from Agenda Item Number 11.

Shepherd to approve Agenda Item Number 2-7 and 9-17.
