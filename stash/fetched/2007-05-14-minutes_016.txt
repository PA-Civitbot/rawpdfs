reimburse up to $300,000 for waterproofing to the Palo Alto History
Museum.

Council Member Drekmeier asked the accuracy of the Heritage Park drainage
and the roof drainage, which flow directly to the rear of the Roth Building.

Mr. Fellman stated that was corrected as part of the $415,000.

Council Member Drekmeier asked about grading Heritage Park away from
the Roth Building.

Mr. Roberts stated the grading had been completed. He added there were a
number of cracks in the concrete and ground water surfaces through the
floor of the basement.

Council Member Drekmeier asked whether there were basement repairs as
part of the $415,000.

Mr. Roberts stated some repairs were made at the time with further work
necessary.

Council Member Drekmeier asked the confidence level of waterproofing with
further work.

Mr. Roberts stated the building was a 70-year old concrete structure with a
large amount of cracking. He believed there will continue to be a support
system for drainage to the basement.

Council Member Drekmeier asked the possibility of bypassing the usage of
the basement and the probability of filling it in.

Mr. Roberts stated the basement was an intricate part of the spine for the
building and it may not be possible to fill it in.

Ms. Robinson stated the fix for the basement was to put a membrane on the
floor and up the walls to prevent seepage. The basement was necessary for
storage.

Council Member Beecham stated there is a shared responsibility for the pre-
existing leakage and he recommended the City pay a portion not to exceed
$150,000 for repairs.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION: Council Member Beecham moved, seconded by
Kishimoto, to share the costs of the repairs where the City would contribute
the maximum amount of $150,000 for waterproofing.
