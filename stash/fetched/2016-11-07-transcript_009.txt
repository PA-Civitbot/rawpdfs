in the summer. The first red arrow there shows the start of a distant—I
think it's about 2,000 feet away, maybe 1,000 feet away. This is the start of
dewatering. The water started to go down. When the closer site started
pumping, the water dropped quite rapidly, about two feet, and then more
slowly down to about three feet below the starting point. When it rained,
the water table came up. Finally the pumping stopped, and then the water
table recovered after about a week; however, the water table recovery was
incomplete. The summary is that dewatering has significant extended
impacts several properties from the boundary of the applicants' properties,
and the water table recovery even after significant rains—we had about one-
fifth of our normal rainfall—is incomplete. Thank you.

Mayor Burt: Thank you.
