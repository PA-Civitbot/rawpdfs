Planning and Transportation Commissioner Michael Griffin said the Planning
and Transportation Commission (P&TC) approved what had been given to
the Council.

Council Member Morton reiterated to Mr. Lusardi that a second unit could not
be built in a R-1 district unless the lot was 8,000 square feet or larger, and
in a R-2 district it would be possible to have a 450-square-foot second unit if
the lot was 6,000 square feet or larger.

Mr. Lusardi said the current minimum lot size in the R-2 district was 6,000
square feet; a duplex required a lot size of 7,500 square feet. The added
provision allowed a small 450-square-foot second unit to be built on lots
from 6,000 to 7,500 square feet.

Council Member Morton asked how many R-2 lots abut R-1 lots.

Mr. Lusardi said that information was not available.

Council Member Morton asked how many additional lots would qualify for a
second unit by lowering the square footage from 7,500 to 6,000 square feet.

Mr. Lusardi said there are 373 R-2 lots in the City.    There were 106     lots
between 6,000 and 7,500 square feet.

Council Member Morton said he had concerns; he did not follow all the
implications.

Mr. Lusardi said information was provided to the community in five
community meetings and there were few community comments on the low-
density residential zoning.

Mr. Griffin confirmed the subject had not received a lot of discussion when it
was before the Planning and Transportation Commission.

Council Member Kishimoto asked whether there was a map for the R-2 zone.

Mr. Lusardi said the map on the wall illustrated the Residential Estate (RE)
and R-2 districts. It did not show which parcels were 6,000 to 7,500 square
feet.
