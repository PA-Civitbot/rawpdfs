bonus and whether she was going to leave it to the Zoning Ordinance
Update (ZOU) process.

Council Member Kishimoto said she was going to table it and not make it a
part of the ZOU since it required $40,000.

Council Member Freeman asked which TDRs had been sold and where were
they located.

Ms. Warheit said she knew of three properties. The property located on
Emerson Street, which involved two historic buildings, and a new building on
the corner of Hamilton Avenue and Emerson Street. All three buildings were
completed at the same time and involved bonus floor areas. TDR’s had been
sold from a Victorian house on Tasso Street, but she was unsure of where
they went or if they were built. A sandwich shop was restored in the SOFA
area where the TDR was transferred but not built. TDR’s did not have to be
built; they could be purchased with the intent of not using them and held for
resale.

Council Member Freeman raised concern on appearance. She said she
appreciated the donor site matrix but missed the identification of the
potential receiver sites and the owners of those sites. The CMR referenced
developers and property owners making suggestions. She wanted to know if
the suggestions were made at a noticed meeting where the public was
present and whether other meetings had taken place where issues were
brought up as proposals.

Mr. Emslie said data was collected from the stakeholders that involved
Downtown property owners with many suggestions that were not included.
The recommendation at the meeting was to determine if Council would be
interested in pursuing some suggestions.

Council Member Freeman said she wanted to see equality between TDR
beneficiaries and what the public received. She was told by the City
Attorney that there were no legal matters surrounding the issue, but she felt
there was the appearance of potential public exclusion if issues came up
