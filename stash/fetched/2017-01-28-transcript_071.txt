Mayor Scharff: Karen, this is not the question. We're getting off track. The
question was do you accept the Motion. You saidâ€”the amendment.

Council Member Holman: I do not.

Mayor Scharff: You do not.

Council Member Holman: At some point in time before we vote, I want to

Mayor Scharff: You do not.

Council Member DuBois: I will second it.

AMENDMENT TO THE SUBSTITUTE MOTION: Council Member Filseth

Council Member Holman: This has nothing to do with that. I apologize for

Mayor Scharff: Lydia.

Council Member Kou: As the City continues to grow, we have a lot of pilot
programs that are coming up and, of course, TMA and the TDMs that are not
really in place and moving forward as smoothly as we'd like to see it and not
