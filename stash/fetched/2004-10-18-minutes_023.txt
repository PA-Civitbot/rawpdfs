Council Member Ojakian asked what timeline had been set for the Work
Plan.

Mr. Baum said the Work Plan was set for the balance of the fiscal year.

Council Member Morton urged his colleagues to vote against the amendment
until the fiscal impact was determined.

City Manager Frank Benest said the City Attorney’s Work Plan also affected
the Planning Department’s Work Plan, which was ambitious at best. If the
Council voted to move forward with additions to the Work Plan, he would
suggest proposed takeaways from their present workload.

Council Member Freeman said she seconded the amendment because every
time an issue was raised that involved CEQA, lengthy discussions ensued
because there were no standardized guidelines.

Council Member Mossar expressed opposition to the amendment because it
involved taking the City Attorney’s Work Plan and attaching a topic of
interest the Council had not given a high priority status.

Council Member Kishimoto said the CEQA update had been on the Planning
Department’s Work Plan for a number of years. She asked whether staff had
the issue on their current year’s Work Plan.

Mr. Benest said it was not a priority of the Planning Department given their
present workload.

AMENDMENT FAILED 2-6, Kishimoto, Freeman yes, Kleinberg absent.

Council Member Freeman asked whether the noise ordinance fell under code
enforcement and, if so, could the ordinance be reviewed to see if it was up-
to-date.

Mr. Baum said the noise ordinance was not included with code enforcement
at the present time.

MOTION: Council Member Freeman moved to request that the City Attorney
review and determine if the noise ordinance is up-to-date.

MOTION FAILED DUE TO LACK OF A SECOND.

MOTION PASSED 8-0, Kleinberg absent.
