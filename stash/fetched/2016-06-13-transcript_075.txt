Mr. Mello: We are completing the Downtown Parking Management Study.
One of the potential outcomes could be recommendations on fees for on-
street and garage parking.

Vice Mayor Scharff: Which could be used to fund the TMA?

Mr. Mello: Yeah. I think it would be up to Council to decide how to use
those revenues from parking.

Vice Mayor Scharff: I was just wondering if it wasâ€”do you have any
preliminary numbers on revenue from something like that?

Mr. Mello: We don't (crosstalk) ...

Vice Mayor Scharff: I heard Adina throwing out a million dollars by adding
it, so I was curious.

Mr. Mello: We don't yet. That'll be one of the outputs of the Downtown
Parking Management Study. We're looking at demand and turnover.

Vice Mayor Scharff: When is that done?

Mr. Mello: We're shooting to complete that by December, by the end of this
year.

Vice Mayor Scharff: We could theoretically, possibly fund the TMA from that
if necessary.

Mr. Mello: Possibly yes.

Vice Mayor Scharff: For the next year, right? The two scenarios are the
three year reduction, which would be Year 2 $1 million, or the five year
which is basically you go to $159,000. Is that right?

Mr. George: It's $3.5 million over five, $2.5 million over three.

Vice Mayor Scharff: It goes to $300,000 the next year. That's right. That's
why I missed this (inaudible) wrong number. Would it be inappropriate to
move the Staff recommendation? It's late.

Mayor Burt: No, go ahead.

Vice Mayor Scharff: I'll just move the Staff recommendation.

Council Member Kniss: I second it.
