Stephanie Munoz, 101 Alma urged the City Council to make small or
moderate changes. She indicated the usefulness of plastic bags; further
sharing the various uses of plastic bags. She encouraged outreach to
residents on how to recycle and reuse plastic bags instead of banning them.

Carroll Harrington, 830 Melville Avenue representing the Palo Alto Business
Goes Green, stated they have reached out to a broad spectrum of groups to
discuss this complicated issue.      She thanked Staff for their efforts
coordinating the Comprehensive Reusable Bag Program, outreach, and
incentives.

Robert Berman, 535 West Crescent Drive stated his disappointment with the
proposed Ordinance because it did not reflect the broad section of views
presented at a Study Session he attended last year. He felt more time
should be spent on the Ordinance and it should address both plastic bags
and paper bags.

Steven Joseph, Council to SaveThePlasticBag.com, stated his organization
previously filed CEQA objections. He indicated SaveThePlasticBag.com had
sent to the City their responses to the City Manager’s memorandum. He
stated SaveThePlasticBag.com recently won a lawsuit with the City of
Manhattan Beach.        Last month, the court ruled the Manhattan Beach
Ordinance banning plastic bags was invalid because the City had not
prepared an Environmental Impact Report (EIR). Just like Manhattan Beach,
the City of Palo Alto is attempting to evade its legal responsibility to prepare
an EIR before passing an Ordinance banning plastic bags. In the event the
City adopts the proposed Ordinance, or any Ordinance banning plastic bags,
without first preparing an EIR SaveThePlasticBag.com will file a petition for
writ of mandate with the Santa Clara County Superior Court. He indicated
the City’s defense of the case would be a waste of taxpayer money, and he
further discouraged it.      He stated one of the City Council Members
mentioned he thought SaveThePlasticBag.com was doing this to protect
revenue of the plastic bag industry; he further stated this was not true. He
stated he was here this evening because this campaign is in response to the
myth, misinformation, and exaggeration that has been disseminated about
plastic bags for several years. The fact of the matter is paper bags are far
worse for the environment than plastic bags. That is the reason
SaveThePlasticBag.com wanted an EIR, to prove that point to the City
Council and the citizens of Palo Alto. The Scottish Report and the Use-Less-
Stuff.com report SaveThePlasticBag.com submitted confirm this and it is
wrong for the City Council and for the City to ban plastic bags while retaining
paper bags. A proposed Ordinance would do exactly that; further stating the
campaign was about protecting environmental truth.
Public Hearing closed at 9:10 p.m.
