Ms. Gitelman reported that converting an existing protected use to another
protected use would be allowed, because both uses were protected under
the proposed ordinance.

Mayor Holman asked if that was stated.

Ms. Gitelman felt it was inherent in the concept.

Mayor Holman did not want to encourage the conversion of retail to
restaurants.

Ms. Gitelman would appreciate the Council's clarification of that, because she
interpreted the ordinance to protect the listed uses but to allow one listed
use to convert to another.

Mayor Holman did not wish to allow more restaurants, especially in the
Downtown area.

Council Member Burt suggested that topic be discussed in relation to the
long-term ordinance.

Mayor Holman did not want restaurants to displace other retail.

Council Member Filseth inquired about the final disposition of the three
pipeline projects.

Mayor Holman advised that the three projects would be exempt from the
urgency ordinance.

Council Member Scharff would support an Amendment not to exempt them,
but he did not believe the Council would support that.

Council Member Berman likely would not support not exempting the
projects; however, he would want more information about the three
projects.

Mayor Holman requested Staff provide additional information about the
pipeline projects when the ordinance returned to the Council. The Council
was aware of the 429 University Avenue Project.

MOTION AS AMENDED PASSED: 7-0 DuBois, Kniss absent

Mayor Holman requested Council Members discuss a long-term ordinance.
She inquired whether Staff would present the urgency ordinance on May 11,
2015.
