                         TRANSCRIPT
Molly Stump, City Attorney: In that spirit, I think it's a legitimate way for
the Council to express its view.

Mayor Burt: Just want to make sure we're following procedures correctly.

Council Member Holman: Just to finish the Motion. To authorize and
encourage the City Clerk to utilize her discretion to include those three
applicants whose applications were received on the calendar date of the
deadlines.

Mayor Burt: Did the seconder want to comment at all? Don't need to?

Council Member Kniss:    Only that I think it's wonderful that Beth gets to
make the decision.

Mayor Burt: Thank you.       I see no more comments.     Please vote.       That
passes unanimously.

MOTION PASSED: 9-0

Mayor Burt: The three additional applications at our places will be included
within our discussion of which applicants to interview. The reason I frame it
that way is that we have most often interviewed all applicants, but we now
have 16 for the Planning and Transportation Commission. Is that correct?

Ms. Minor: That's correct.

Mayor Burt: With 10 minutes per Commissioner and no time gap in between
for shuffling chairs ...

Ms. Minor: Mayor Burt?

Mayor Burt: Yes.

Ms. Minor: Planning and Transportation interviews are 15 minutes.

Mayor Burt: Fifteen, excuse me.

Ms. Minor: All other Boards are 10 minutes.

Mayor Burt:    We're probably looking at Planning and Transportation
Commission 4 1/2-plus hours if we interviewed all 16.

Council Member Kniss: A question, Mr. Mayor.

Mayor Burt: Yeah.

                                                                      Page 40 of 120
