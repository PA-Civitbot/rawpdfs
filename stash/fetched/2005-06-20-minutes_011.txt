     A.    The Finance Committee Recommends the City Council Approve
           Funding from the 2005-07 Council Contingency in the Amount of
           $4,492 for Human Services Resource Allocation Process (HSRAP):
           Project Sentinel, One-Time Funding for Two Years and the
           Ordinance Portions Related Thereto.

Council Member Morton would not participate in the item due to a conflict of
interest because he provided or had provided services to those organizations
receiving Community Development Block Grant Funds.

MOTION: Council Member Ojakian moved, seconded by Freeman, to accept the
Finance Committee recommendation to approve funding from the 2005-07
Council Contingency in the Amount of $4,492 for HSRAP: Project Sentinel, one-

Council Member Ojakian asked whether previous year funds were put in as a
one-time expense.

Mr. Yeats said yes.

the previous year the Council gave a total of $60,000 to the Urban Ministry
and, currently, an additional $31,000 was being added, while reductions had
taken place in other social services.

Vice Mayor Kleinberg said she recalled the Council approved a one-time

Mr. Yeats said that was correct. It was a one-time allocation of $25,000 from
the Council Contingency Fund for the Urban Ministry Food Safety Net.
