shall continue to receive a $3,900 Transportation Allowance (formerly
referred to as “Auto Allowance”). Council Appointed Officers are encouraged
to take advantage of transportation alternatives as feasible; 4) the City
Manager will continue to have use of a City-owned fleet vehicle, with the
understanding he is also encouraged to take advantage of transportation
alternatives as feasible; and 5) the City Council agrees to update the
contract for City Manager Benest to confirm the existing policy that he may
be involved in outside employment as long as it does not conflict or interfere
with his job as City Manager.

City Attorney Gary Baum said, as a point of clarification in response to the
public comment, the Council would not actually make any change to the
contract that evening, but rather direct staff to come back with it.

Mayor Beecham asked if there was anything the Council could do in order to
take action that evening.

Mr. Baum said he did not believe so.

Council Member Mossar said it should return on the Consent Calendar.

Mr. Baum said the change to the contract was minor.

MOTION PASSED 8-0, Freeman absent.

Council Member Mossar expressed thanks to Mr. Shannon for all his work in
helping the Council through the process.

Council Member Kishimoto concurred with the comments of Council Member
Mossar. She also thanked the CAO Chair Council Member Mossar for doing a
wonderful job in leading the Committee.

The City Council adjourned to a Special Meeting at 11:30 p.m. as the
Palo Alto Redevelopment Agency and reconvened as the City Council.
