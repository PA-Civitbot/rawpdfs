Council Member Price asked whether the cut and cover costs for the BART
system showed such a wide outlier.

Mr. Young stated by looking at the guideway costs, we can not justify the
costs BART was using.

Council Member Scharff stated one of the alternatives was at grade level
through Palo Alto. Another alternative was at grade level or cut and cover
beginning in the City of Mountain View, then cut and cover through South
Palo Alto and then heading down into a deep bore.

Mr. Young stated that was correct.

Council Member Scharff asked for clarification that once South Palo Alto was
reached, everything could be cut and cover.

Mr. Young stated that was one option being reviewed.

Council Member Scharff asked whether there was an option where the HSR
went from cut and cover and came up to grade level at a portal into South
Palo Alto.

Mr. Young stated there were multiple scenarios being drawn up and although
that specific combination had not been created, it could still be an option.

Council Member Scharff asked if the bored tunnel was an option and would
the tunnel come out at Menlo Park or San Francisquito Creek.

Mr. Young stated the tunnel would exit north of the San Francisquito Creek
and would come up to a gradual grade.

Mr. Emslie asked with the bored tunnel option would a train heading south
come out into a trench or a cut and cover.

Mr. Young stated usually emerging from a bored tunnel there was a short
area of cut and cover.

Beth Bunnenberg, 2351 Ramona Street, spoke regarding the Palo Alto
historical sites being impacted by the HSR in terms of vibrations, noise and
visual impairment. Deep tunneling would provide the best mitigation to
preserve the Palo Alto heritage.

Herb Borock, P.O. Box 632, urged Council to oppose or take no position on
the legislation requesting funds to support the electrification of CalTrain.
