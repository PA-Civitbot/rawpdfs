Mayor Scharff asked if height was limited to 30 feet under RM-2 and RM-15
zoning.

Mr. Wong answered yes.

Mayor Scharff reiterated that the height limit was 30 feet on both Maybell
Avenue and Clemo Avenue unless the Council approved rezoning.

Mr. Wong replied yes.

Mayor Scharff asked if a three-story house could be constructed within 30
feet.

Mr. Aknin believed it would be difficult.

Vice Mayor Shepherd requested PAHC comment on the change of lot size
resulting from the decrease in number of houses.

Ms. Gonzales needed to evaluate the change.          The lot sizes would be
approximately 5,400-6,000 square feet.

Vice Mayor Shepherd inquired whether that was the normal size of a lot for a
single-family home.

Ms. Gonzales responded yes, in that neighborhood.

Vice Mayor Shepherd asked if the lot size would be approximately 55 feet by
100 feet.

Ms. Gonzales replied yes, approximately that size.

Mr. Aknin noted the lots would be approximately 57 feet wide.

Vice Mayor Shepherd asked if the lot depth would be 100 feet.

Mr. Aknin reported the depth would be slightly less with the street and
driveway. Across Maybell Avenue, the average lot width was 50-52 feet.

Council Member Kniss inquired whether the project review and approval
could be completed by the end of June with additional ARB review.

Ms. Stump explained that the Planned Community (PC) Ordinance could be
passed and adopted while the limited issues of design review would return to
the ARB for review. That process did not bar PAHC from proceeding with the
tax credit applications.
