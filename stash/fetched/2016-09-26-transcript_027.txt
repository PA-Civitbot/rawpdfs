Council Member Schmid: Okay.

Mayor Burt: ... the additional subsidy.

Council Member Schmid: I withdraw my second.

SECOND WITHDRAWN BY THE SECONDER

MOTION FAILED DUE TO THE LACK OF A SECOND

Council Member Holman: Let me clarify with Rob or Lalo. Do we need
Number 2 but just delete the $1 per square foot? We don't want to ...

Mayor Burt: I'm sorry. Council Member Holman, I believe that Council
Member Schmid is withdrawing his second because he doesn't support the
substance of the Motion.

Council Member Holman:       I was thinking he needed clarification on the
location of Avenidas.

Mayor Burt: No. Now that he has clarification, he's withdrawn.

Council Member Schmid: Right.

Mayor Burt: Council Member Kniss.

Council Member Kniss: All respect due to you, Karen, on this one, I
disagree. Again, I think it's institutional memory. I can remember that
there has been a discussion about Avenidas for many years. I see John Sink
in the audience, with whom I worked on the senior health program that was
down at one of the churches way back when. This is a unique offering to the
community. I don't know how long you think you'll be there. I'm looking at
Jim and Lisa. I'm guessing probably a couple of years. I think it also will
open it up about the time that we're looking at what do you do with that
next. I'm hoping that you'reâ€”I didn't get a second. Excuse me. I'm
moving the recommendation. Excuse me.

Vice Mayor Scharff: Second that.

Mayor Burt:  You not only didn't get a second, you didn't move the
recommendation.

Council Member Berman: You got so excited by it.

Council Member Kniss: I did.
