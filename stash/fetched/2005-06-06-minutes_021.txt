have any    impact on finding No.2. The Grand Jury had relied on the
previous    City Attorney’s opinion and weighed heavily on their
response.   Her interpretation of the Charter was even minor exchange
should be   approved by the electorate.

Mr. Baum said he could include Mr. Ariel Calonne’s 2003 memo in
response.

INCORPORATED INTO MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to include as an attachment to the response
letter the memo from previous City Attorney Ariel Calonne on June 19,
2003.

Council Member Ojakian apologized for his oversight for not passing
the memo on to his colleagues.

Council Member Cordell read the following excerpt from Mr. Calonne’s
memo: “I believed there was no legislative history to the contrary that
is that exchanges might not be okay, but believe that it was important
for the Council to indicate its interpretation of the Charter by enacting
the implementing Ordinance before moving ahead on any park
exchange.” She questioned whether an Ordinance was implemented.

Mr. Ojakian said an Ordinance was enacted to make the exchange.

Council Member Cordell said from what she heard in terms of
legislative intent, she urged her Colleagues to not approve the
disagreement with the finding.

Vice Mayor Kleinberg encouraged her colleagues to not quickly dismiss
the Grand Jury’s finding as to how the City respected the Charter and
to not repeat the action in the future.
