Mr. Baum suggested changing the language in the voting process from the
highest number of Council votes to the majority number of Council votes.

Council Member Klein stated altering the language did not seem to accurately
capture what Council Member Schmid had pointed out. He stated there were
two separate votes where everyone received a majority.

Mr. Baum suggested to change the language to clarify the first group of votes
who received the majority.

Council Member Schmid stated two members were elected with the majority
in the first round and the third member was elected with the majority in the
third round.

Council Member Espinosa noted with the Staff change there was support from
a number of UAC members.
