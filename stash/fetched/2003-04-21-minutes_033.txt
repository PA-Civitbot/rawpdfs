understanding was that they would have the option to retain or remove the
spine at their discretion or any successful respondent would also.

Council Member Freeman asked Ms. Holman to point out in the figures in her
handout where the savings would occur.

Ms. Holman pointed out the column of figures that would reduce costs.

Council Member Freeman asked whether the less rigorous method meant the
spine would be retained and supported at the reduced cost.

Ms. Holman replied yes.

Council Member Freeman asked whether they would have to wait to find out
which non-profit would win the bid and have the opportunity to design the
building.

Ms. Holman replied yes.

Council Member Freeman said it would be easier to design the building by
using the less rigorous method than the more rigorous method because the
more rigorous method would have to tear down structures.

Ms. Holman said the more rigorous method would mean that more would
have to be removed in order to provide for entryways and windows.

MOTION: Council Member Morton moved, seconded by Ojakian, to move
the Closed Session items forward and continue the item after the Closed
Session.

MOTION PASSED 9-0.
