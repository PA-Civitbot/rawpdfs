Vice Mayor Shepherd requested that Staff communicate with the City of East
Palo Alto about parking along Woodland Drive. She was concerned about
the separate charge of parking from the rental cost, and asked about State
prohibitions against that.

Mr. Aknin noted each rental unit received one parking space. The two-
bedroom units formerly received two free parking spaces. Now, the renter
paid for a second space.

Vice Mayor Shepherd asked why the number of parking spaces could deviate
among cities.

Mr. Aknin felt Ordinances had not caught up to the market charges for
parking spaces. Charging for additional parking spaces was feasible when
the rental units were located close to transit and ample free parking was not
available.

Vice Mayor Shepherd inquired about possible legal recourse. She asked if
the two parking lots were lots or garages.

Mr. Aknin stated they were parking lots.

Vice Mayor Shepherd asked if there were plans to build garages on the lots
for a future apartment complex.

Mr. Aknin did not know. There were no long-term plans for anything other
than parking on those lots.

Vice Mayor Shepherd felt the property owners should provide adequate
parking.

Council Member Berman asked if Staff obtained a baseline analysis of the
parking situation outside the proposed restricted area for future comparison.

Mr. Rodriguez indicated by the end of August 2013 Staff would have an
expanded footprint.

Council Member Berman shared his experience counting cars in the Crescent
Park area in January 2013.      He hoped an RPP program was not
implemented. He would reach out to the City of East Palo Alto regarding the
parking problem.
