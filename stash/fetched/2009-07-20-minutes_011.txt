exempt from the BLT model. Brokerage firms would pay the BLT for all
brokers and agents based on a full-time equivalent and include
apportionment of 50 percent. The BLT would be paid by independent
brokers or agents including their employees. The adjustments changed the
tax rate for professional, business services, and miscellaneous increased
from $88 to $95 for tax rate per employee. Retail, personal services, hotels,
and wholesale manufacturing decreased from $40 to $34. There were no
changes in multi-unit retail and commercial property tax rate. The ongoing
estimated administrative cost was $257,626, with net revenue of
$3,060,693. The implementation recommendation was no tax from January
1 to June 30, 2010; 50 percent of the established tax rate from July 1 to
December 30, 2010, due January 1, 2011, with a 30-day grace period; 100
percent of the established tax rate from January 1 to December 31, 2011,
due January 1, 2012, and 100 percent of the established tax rate from
January 1 to December 31, 2012 and due on January 1, 2013. The
implementation cost increased by $14,000 to provide medical and leave time
benefits for hourly employees and a decrease of $73,000 by changing the
2.5 Code Enforcement positions to an Accounting Specialist staffing level.
Rather than having a Code Enforcement Officer issuing citations at the
business sites, the Revenue Collections Supervisor would be notified and
have the ability to issue the citation. The goal was to have the program
automated and on-line.       Staff’s recommendations were 1) to adopt a
Resolution by submitting the proposed BLT Ordinance ballot measure to
voters in the November 3, 2009 General Municipal Election, 2) designate up
to four Council Members to author the argument in favor of the measure, 3)
authorize submittal of rebuttal arguments, and 4) to approve the revised
rate structure that included an exemption for nonprofit organizations.

Robert Moss, 4010 Orme Street, said he was in support of the BLT concept.
He needed clarification on how employees were counted if they did not work
the 2080 hours per year and how were hours calculated if work was done
out-of-town.

John Hackmann said the City’s financial problem was due to a spending
problem and not the lack of BLT. He felt the BLT was a work in progress and
certain particulars of the Ordinance were still unclear. He urged the Council
to exempt home-based businesses and eliminate the criminal penalties on
false statements that could be argued as being intentional if BLT were
passed.

Council Member Barton asked whether the program covered a business with
sole proprietorship, with no employees, but had a consultant working out-of-
state.
