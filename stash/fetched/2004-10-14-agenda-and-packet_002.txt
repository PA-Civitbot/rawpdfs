the end of the year.    The Clerk would be responsible for ensuring
continuity.

City Attorney Gary Baum pointed out the timeline is inconsistent with
management and professional performance evaluations, as well as the
CAO contracts.

Chair Mossar noted the timeline could be part of contractual
negotiations, but the Performance Evaluation System must be
approved tonight to stay on schedule.

Mayor Beecham said since the CAO evaluations are behind schedule,
this issue must be part of discussions with the CAOs and CAO
contracts could be amended to reflect the new schedule.

Mr. Shannon stated he would meet first with Council Members and
then the CAOs and prepare a summary of objectives identified by the
CAOs, as well as Council Members. He anticipated both activities
would be undertaken sequentially and would have this information to
Council Members prior to the performance evaluation with the City
Manager on October 19, 2004.

Mayor Beecham expressed concern regarding the relationship between
compensation and performance, as mentioned on Page 3, since it
leaves the entire compensation assessment wide open.

Mr. Shannon indicated the City already had a Variable Compensation
for City management and professionals. He noted also there are
prevailing practices, which are being collected as part of the survey by
Human Resources.

Council Member Kishimoto noted one element is market-based and
one is incentive-based, and only the market-based adjustment became
part of the CAO base salary, which could be used as a guide.

Chair Mossar said the intent is to create a bonus, which would be a
negotiation between the Council and the CAOs.

Mr. Baum stated the current practice for the Variable Management
Compensation is for 0-7 percent of the base salary.

Mayor Beecham requested there be consistency regarding the use of
the words “goals” and “objectives” throughout the Performance
Evaluation System.
