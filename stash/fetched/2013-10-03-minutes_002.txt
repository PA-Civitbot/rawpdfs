City Attorney – Advise the Council whether such TDM Districts would be legal
and if so what laws and legal procedures and processes would apply to
them;

City Manager – 1) Prepare a preliminary report on the proposed TDM
Districts, at a cost of not more than $100,000 in staff time, (a) setting forth
staff’s initial views on TDM Districts, (b) outlining the steps necessary for an
in-depth study of TDM Districts and its timeline, (c) identifying any local or
regional governments that have TDM Districts comparable to that proposed
in the Colleagues’ memorandum and (d) advising whether the services of a
consultant would be needed for a more detailed, in-depth study of such
proposed TDM Districts and if so what the consultant would be expected to
do and his/her expected cost.

2) Organize one or more Study Sessions on TDM Districts with (a)
appropriate speakers with relevant experience in TDM programs such as
Stanford’s and Contra Costa County’s and (b) outreach to various
stakeholders including but not limited to adjacent residential neighborhoods
and potentially effected business interests to attend and participate in such
Study Session(s)

3) Advise the Council on other possible solutions to the City’s traffic and
parking problems

Schedule – The reports from the City Attorney and the City Manager shall be
due not later than January 20, 2014 and the initial Study Session shall take
place not later than February 03, 2014

Mayor Scharff felt Council Members should clarify the language as needed.
The Council should discuss TDM in general. Building parking garages and
implementing Residential Parking Permit (RPP) Programs would not solve the
traffic and parking problems.

Council Member Klein added that Item Number 3 was an invitation for Staff
to suggest additional ideas. One such idea was a City parking lot on East
Highway 101 with a robust shuttle service to Downtown.

Council Member Kniss suggested the Council discuss the meaning of TDM
and how one might operate in Palo Alto.

James Keene, City Manager, noted the Colleague's Memorandum focused on
TDM Districts.     The concept was to provide alternative means of
transportation in order to reduce the number of car trips. Other solutions
