Council Member Shepherd indicated the appeal process would return to the
Council.

Vice Mayor Scharff asked Council Member Klein if his original amendment
was correct to exclude 1880 Park or did he wish to give Staff discretion to
decide between 1880 Park and 1920 Park.

Council Member Klein said it should be "and Staff consider."

Vice Mayor Scharff asked if Council Member Klein was giving Staff the
authority to continue with 1880 if it chose, or was he excluding it and going
to 1920 or nothing.

Council Member Klein expressed his concern that the residents of 1920 had
not had a chance to speak to the issue.

Vice Mayor Scharff asked if he was allowing Staff the discretion to decide
1880.

Council Member Klein answered yes.

Council Member Holman stated the purpose of the Amendment was to give
Staff and AT&T flexibility and latitude in determining a different location.
She indicated the Incorporation accepted by the maker and seconder
proscribed a second location.

Vice Mayor Scharff indicated it didn't; that it was either 1880 or 1920. He
asked if Council Member Holman's Amendment would exclude 1880.

Council Member Holman answered 1880 would be excluded, and other
alternatives would be considered.

Council Member Burt asked if she was excluding 1880 from approval tonight
or from future consideration.

Council Member Holman said her intention was to exclude 1880 from
approval tonight and to look at alternate locations.

Council Member Burt asked if alternate locations included 1880.

Council Member Holman replied no.
