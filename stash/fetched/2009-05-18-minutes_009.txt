MOTION PASSED: 7-0 Barton, Morton absent

Council took a break from 9:13 p.m. and reconvened at 9:24 p.m.
10.   Adoption of a Mitigated Negative Declaration and the Foothills Fire
      Management Plan.

Interim Deputy City Manager, Kelly Morariu stated Staff had been working
on the Foothill Fire Management Plan which represented the balance
between the priorities of protecting lives and property while preserving the
natural environment in existence within the Foothill area.

Wildland Resource Manager, Carol Rice gave a brief presentation on the
Foothill Fire Management Plan regarding the location of where the plan
served, type of processes, and fire safety.

Council Member Kishimoto asked what the largest change would be after
the Plan had been implemented.

Ms. Rice stated the evacuation routes on Page Mill Road and Los Trancos
Road experienced the largest change.

Council Member Kishimoto asked for clarification on the footage clearing.

Ms. Rice stated the first ten feet of grass was required to be cut back and
the shrubs required management to avoid excessive growth underneath the
trees.

Council Member Kishimoto asked whether canopies or a cluster of trees
were allowed to remain.

Ms. Rice stated clusters of trees where they created a canopy effect on the
hillside was good for shading which prevented excessive growth of
unwanted shrubbery. She noted where canopies grew over a road, the Fire
Fighters had concerns.

Council Member Kishimoto asked who would be training and supervising the
crews removing the shrubbery and grasses.

Ms. Rice stated there would be ongoing training for Staff by the
implementation team.

Council Member Kishimoto stated the importance of crew members being
familiar with the native foliage versus shrubbery.
