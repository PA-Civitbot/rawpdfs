Council Member Cordell asked if the Comp Plan referred to a specific square
footage to maintain the scale.

Mr. Emslie said that was correct.

Council Member Cordell was supportive of the concept presented by the
developer for a mixed-use site. She suggested the developer continue to be
flexible and asked for additional square footage for the proposed project.

Council Member Barton asked whether the square footage included retail
space in the basement.

Mr. McNellis said the square footage included the storage space in the
basement.

Council Member Barton asked whether there were parking easements.

City Attorney Baum said generally the City was not responsible for
easements between properties. He said if property owners filed claims
against one another for parking on their properties it would be a civil matter
between the properties. There appeared to be an easement for access and
an easement for egress for one of the adjacent properties.

Mayor Kleinberg asked staff to describe the adjacent properties and
easements.

Mr. McNellis said there had been repeated claims indicating the apartments
would have the ability to park at the shopping center and an easement
would be granted.

City Attorney Baum said neither easement should have any bearing upon the
City.

Mr. McNellis said there was no parking easement in favor of the apartments.

Council Member Barton spoke about the importance of the proposed project
and was in favor of a mixed-use building.

Council Member Morton asked whether the developer would be able to
reduce housing in the Planned Community (PC) Zone.

Mr. Emslie said the developer was proposing    to change the use of the PC for
the residential portion, which would require   an amendment to the PC or a
zone change to reflect the commercial and       residential sections. The City
would have complete discretion over the         development proposed.     The
