12.   Resolution 9490 entitled “Resolution of the Council of the City of Palo
      Alto Scheduling the City Council Vacation and Winter Closure for
      2015.”

Beth Minor, Acting City Clerk, sent a poll to Council Members requesting
their preference for the Council Vacation, and received two responses of
mid-July to mid-August.     That timeframe would correspond to school
vacations. Mr. Rossmann, Office and Management and Budget Director,
scheduled the Public Hearing for the Fiscal Year 2016 Budget on June 9,
2015.

James Keene, City Manager, recalled the Council vacation in 2014 was held
in July. June 16, 2015 was held as a carryover date for the Budget. The
Council could schedule its vacation for July. The Council always had a
problem with the last meeting prior to vacation, no matter when the
vacation was scheduled.

Council Member Kniss noted June and August contained five Mondays. She
assumed the Council would not meet on June 29 and August 31, 2015.

Mr. Keene agreed there would not be a meeting on June 29 if the vacation
was scheduled during the month of June.

Council Member Kniss advised that the school year began on August 17.
There were two meetings in August, August 3 and 10. The Council could
break after July 6 or take all of July and the first week of August as vacation.
If the vacation began at the end of June, the Council would miss meeting
dates on July 6, 13, 20, 27 and August 3. She inquired whether the Council
missed five meetings during its 2014 vacation.

Mr. Keene answered yes.

Council Member Kniss suggested Council Members consider the end of June
through the first or second week of August for vacation.

Mr. Keene remarked that the vacation would extend from June 29 through
August 3, which would be six weeks.

Council Member Kniss clarified that the Council normally did not meet on
June 29; therefore, it would be five weeks.

Mr. Keene believed that employees would prefer to align their vacations with
those dates.

Council Member Kniss recalled that the Council changed its vacation the
prior two years in response to the school year beginning earlier.
