Ms. LeClaire said it was. She said hoteliers were asked what was palatable
and what the traffic could bare when the initial assessment fee was set up.
There had been two increases in the past nine years.

Council Member Price asked if Staff knew what the City of Berkeley was
doing differently since the baseline data reflected Berkeley as doing better
than other cities.

City Manager, James Keene, said the Shattuck Hotel recently had been
renovated which improved the rooms.

Mr. Williams said Berkeley had business             tours   and   a   business
convention/visitor's bureau type of an approach.

Council Member Yeh asked whether an analysis was done regarding the
change in Transient Occupancy Tax (TOT) and what was attributed to the
smaller versus larger hotels.

Ms. LeClaire said smaller hotels were harder to track since they benefited
from overflow, tour and travel, and film room nights for production crews.
She said as a rule twenty percent of guests coming in for a convention
booked outside of the room blocks looking for less expensive or closer
accommodations and was difficult to track.

Council Member Yeh asked whether consideration was made for the smaller
hotels, particularly those in the south part of Palo Alto, because guests opted
to stay in neighboring towns due to the added cost.

Ms. LeClaire said that was a concern when the TBID was created but found it
not to be an issue.

Council Member Yeh asked what Staff's envision was regarding the potential
savings of $60,000 to $100,000.

Mr. Keene said the funding would help alleviate budget gaps the City was
facing.

Council Member Holman said she was interested in a random and cross-
section sampling on how the smaller hotels would respond to the TOT and
their interests and fears in joining the program.
