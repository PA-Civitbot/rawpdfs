what was on the Agenda. She enquired whether the rules of urgency could
be waived by a vote of the Council.

Ms. Harrison stated the Council had waived procedures for urgent matters on
previous occasions.

Council Member Kleinberg stated the two-week time frame for the staff to
prepare the resource impacts could be waived by the Council in an urgency
situation.

Council Member Cordell suggested language to be added “where the matter
is an urgent one, on vote of the Council, the matter may be agenized for
immediate action.”

Council Member Kleinberg said the Council does not vote to agendize an
item; the Council votes to waive the timeframe.

Council Member Cordell suggested the language change to “The Council may
take immediate action.”

Council Member Morton stated the friendly amendment would read “Council
Members would consult with the City Manager and any other Council
Appointed Officers (CAO’s) as appropriate.”

Council Member Kleinberg noted staff suggested that Council Members notify
the City Manager when intending to submit a Colleagues Memo.

Council Member Beecham requested the removal of any timeframe in the
language. The practical case was the Council Members would speak with
staff regarding the time needed for their review and agenda placement.

City Manager Frank Benest stated Council consulted with the City Manager’s
office regarding the scheduling, content, and the resource impacts.

Council Member Beecham asked whether staff preferred a two-week
timeframe in the language.

Ms. Harrison said staff preferred to have a full discussion regarding the
Colleague Memos and the resource impacts without returning to Council.
Colleague Memos had been received by staff on Thursday mornings, which
required significant staff effort and with no opportunity to provide input.

Council Member Beecham believed the timeframe of Colleague Memos
should remain open.
