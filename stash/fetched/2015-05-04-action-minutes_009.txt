MOTION RESTATED FOR THE PURPOSE OF VOTING: Council Member
Burt moved, seconded by Council Member DuBois to continue the appeal and
request the applicant redesign the project and return to the Architectural
Review Board and the Historic Resources Board to address the following
issues:

Historic Resources Board
A.   The Preservation Architecture report focuses on whether there are
     criteria for a historic district. There is no need for existence of a district
     for there to be historic considerations. The HRB should determine
     whether there are other factors that should be considered.
B.   What is the applicable “area of potential effect” under CEQA analysis?
C.   There are a number of historic structures near (e.g. on Kipling), one
     next to the proposed project and several across the street. How will
     the project impact these structures?
D.   Whether the mass, scale, and compatibility of the proposed project
     has an impact on the existing historic properties should be analyzed.
