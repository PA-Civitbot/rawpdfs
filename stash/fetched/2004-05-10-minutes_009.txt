Betsy Allyn, 4186 Willmar Drive, said she appreciated open government in a
timely manner. She agreed with the requirement that two Council votes
should be necessary to remove an item from the Consent Calendar.

Bob Moss, 4010 Orme Street, said having only two Council Members remove
an item for discussion was appropriate. He admired the City Auditor's
recommendations and concerns about speeding up the process, but it should
be done cautiously. Although the City was capable of posting agenda items
in text form on the website, they could not post graphics and photographs.
In order for people to understand and read those items, the accompanying
photographs and graphics should be posted as well. He also felt the six-foot
side yard setback was an example where staff had spent too much time
looking at nonsense variances.

Lynn Chiapella, 631 Colorado Avenue, concurred with Mr. Moss on the six-
foot setback variances. She said minor ARB and Conditional Use Permit
(CUP) changes had been used to expand existing development into more
useable space by converting janitorial, recycling and storage on-site space
into other kinds of space.

Mayor Beecham declared the Public Hearing closed.
