Action Items

11a. (Former Agenda Item Number 7) Request for Finding that Stevenson
     House Rehabilitation Proposed Ownership Structure is Compliant With
     the Site-Specific Planned Community Zoning Ordinance Adopted in
     June 1965.

Hillary Gitelman, Planning and Community Environment Director, reported
the item was an interpretation of a Planned Community (PC) Ordinance
which permitted a use of a non-profit senior citizens housing development
with not more than 120 dwelling units with dining, cultural, and recreational
facilities for the use of tenants. Staff requested the Council interpret the
phrase "non-profit senior citizens housing development" as "affordable."
Changing the ownership structure of the non-profit entity would allow it to
qualify for tax credits to fund rehabilitation of the facility. Loan documents
to effectuate a City loan of $1 million to fund rehabilitation would be
presented to the Council in early April 2015.
