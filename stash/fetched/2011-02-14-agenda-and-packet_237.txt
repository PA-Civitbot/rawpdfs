 1   The other fact, and the hard fact that no one seems to want to accept is that people come there by
 2   car. The overwhelming majority of people are there in automobiles. You might like them to
 3   walk. You might like them to cycle. But that is not what they are doing.

 5   There has been no consensus at the business meetings, the merchants on California Avenue. As
 6   a matter of fact there was a meeting on this past Friday at which there was significant opposition
 7   expressed.

 9   Mollie Stone’s anticipates a serious negative effect if the lane reduction occurs because people
10   come to Mollie Stone’s to shop, you go home with three bags of groceries, you are not doing it
11   on a bicycle, you are doing it in a car.

13   The question is who – he spoke of many amenities – who maintains these amenities, the tables
14   and chairs? Right now the farmer’s market is a disaster for the businesses that are open on
15   Sundays. Scarcely a merchant is in favor of it. It might do better moved to the VTA parking lot
16   and then it might bring business to the area. Right now it is an inhibition to business.
17
18   Remember that University, Castro, and Santa Cruz are all congested streets. Many people don’t
19   go there any more for that very reason. It is sort of the Yogi Berra problem.

21   The essential problem of California Avenue is parking. If you are going to help the merchants, if
22   you are going to increase economic activity, if you are going to increase your sales tax revenues
23   get adequate parking. Right now from eleven o’clock in the morning until two-thirty or three
24   there aren’t any spots, and from five-thirty or six to nine or ten the same is true. So if you wish
25   to help the folks on California Avenue provide parking and figure out a way to get the bikes
26   rerouted around in their own lanes. Thank you.

28   Chair Tuma: Thank you. I think one of the Commissioners has a question for you if you
29   wouldn’t mind coming back to the podium. Thank you.
30
31   Commissioner Keller: Thank you sir. I am wondering if you are one of the merchants on
32   California Avenue?
33
34   Mr. McMillan: Yes, Accent Arts. The art supply store.
35
36   Commissioner Keller: Thank you very much.
37
38   Chair Tuma: Okay, Robyn Duby followed by Todd Burke.

40   Ms. Robyn Duby, Palo Alto: I am a 20-year resident of the College Terrace neighborhood and I
41   am here this evening to support the Staff’s recommendations to the Commission to approve the
42   Negative Declaration.
43
44   What I would also like to do is commend the Staff for their process of inclusiveness and
45   responsiveness to the community. Unlike the California Avenue street debacle they have really
46   kicked in and done due diligence in collecting the community’s input. The due diligence has
