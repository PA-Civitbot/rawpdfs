Mayor Burt: Our next item is a continued Public Hearing for 1601 California
Avenue. A request by the Board of Trustees of Stanford University to amend
the final map for Tract Number 10281, which was recorded in January 2015
for the 1451-1601 California Avenue development, which includes a total of
180 dwelling units. The environmental assessment was by the City of Palo
Alto and Stanford University Development and the environmental impact
report. The Zoning District is the Research Park and alternative standard
overlays too. Ms. Gitelman.

Hillary Gitelman, Planning and Community Environment Director:           Thank
you, Mayor Burt and Council ...

Mayor Burt: I'm sorry. Council Member DuBois needs to announce.

Council Member DuBois: Since this is real property owned by Stanford
University and they're a source of income, I'm going to recuse myself from
this item.

Mayor Burt: Thank you.

Council Member DuBois left the meeting at 7:02 P.M.

Ms. Gitelman: Thank you, Mayor Burt and Council Members. I'm Hillary
Gitelman, the Planning Director. I'm joined by Jodie Gerhardt, who's our
Current Planning Manager. Again, Jodie and I are standing in for the Project
Planner who had planned to be here yesterday. When the item was
continued, it was not consistent with his vacation schedule. Luckily, Jodie
has a lot of background on this site, being involved in prior entitlements.
We're here to discuss the proposed amendment to the final map for 1601
California Avenue. The project derives from the Mayfield Development
Agreement, which was adopted by Stanford and the City in 2005. There was
an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) certified to cover that Agreement and
subsequent projects under the Agreement. The Agreement itself allows for
180 units on the project site. A tentative map was approved in 2014 to
subdivide the parcel. Subsequent to that, the buildings were demolished on
the site.   This allowed for additional testing for soil contamination as
