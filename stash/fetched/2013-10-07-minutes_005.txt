Vice Chair Bacchetti felt Palo Alto was in a position to do something
important in terms of homelessness. The Task Force brought together many
agencies in an attempt to implement long-term strategies to help homeless
people rebuild their lives and achieve independence.

Council Member Price remarked that that jurisdictions, governmental entities
and boundaries were inconvenient with respect to homelessness.

Chair Oâ€™Nan indicated issues such as homelessness recurred because the
underlying problems were chronic. A sustainable funding source for services
was needed, because people within the community would always be at risk.

Council Member Berman requested Commissioners contact him directly with
concerns. He suggested the HRC collaborate with San Mateo County as well
as Santa Clara County.       The recent focus on homelessness was an
opportunity to make strides in providing services.

Vice Mayor Shepherd recommended the HRC consult with Staff regarding the
technicalities of Commissioners meeting with Council Members in order to
maintain independence of thought. She agreed with Council Member Schmid
that the HRC should report changes in the community. The HSRAP service
report provided context for discussion of other topics. She wanted to
understand the cases presented for mediation to provide further context.

The City Council adjourned to the Council Chambers at 7:10 P.M.
