that's in the Budget document itself. Then Walter and his team will hand out
the Budgets and very briefly go through the document just to orient you to
it. In particular, we want to show you some slides related to the Capital
Budget, since we made some significant changes in the reporting in the
Capital Budget to follow up on directives from the Council. Honorable Mayor
and City Council, in accordance with my responsibility as City Manager as
outlined in the City Charter, I'm submitting this City of Palo Alto Fiscal Year
2016 Proposed Operating Budget. The Citywide Expenditure Budget of
$553.7 million has increased by $83 million, I'm going to round these off, or
17.7 percent in comparison to the Fiscal Year 2015 Adopted Budget of $470
million. This is primarily due to a change in carrying forward capital funds
from one year to the next, so you can see the full impact of capital funding
in projects. That accounts for slightly over $50 million of that $83 million
increase. Utility purchases at $9.3 million, salary and benefits at $8.8
million, and additional general infrastructure funding of $5 million are the
notable deltas between the two fiscal years. The Proposed General Fund
Operating Budget is $185 million, increased by $14 million or 8.2 percent in
comparison to the prior year. Again, primarily due to an increase in
infrastructure funding. All of that $5 million is there. Salary and benefits
costs of $5.9 million. I know that the Finance Committee and ultimately the
Council will want to, as you did last year, take a hard look at the position
recommendations in this year's Budget. I did want to be sure Finance had
the opportunity to assess and respond to our attempt to respond to Council
priorities and demands facing the City. Citywide across all funds, full-time
FTE [Fulltime Equivalent] benefited positions are increasing by a net of 7.3
FTEs. That's less than 1 percent, up from 1,033 in the 2015 Budget to
1,041. The net year-over-year increase of 7.3 includes a decrease of 6 FTE
positions approved by the Council in this fiscal year, offset with an increase
of 13 positions.     Despite this increase, a decade ago the City's total
budgeted position count was 1,073 FTEs or 3.3 percent above this level. For
the General Fund over this same period, the Budget position count was 649
FTEs or 7.5 percent more than the recommended Budget that I'm proposing
at this time. During that same ten-year period, the City's population grew
by approximately 4,300 residents or 7 percent, to put these numbers in
contrast.    I share, though, the Council's concern about the impact in
particular of long-term benefited positions. The General Fund Expenditure
Budget is balanced with $183.5 million in revenues and $1.6 million in Fiscal
Year 2015 carry forward surplus funds which is out of an estimated $5
million surplus that we project at the end of April 2015. As part of this
Budget, the General Fund Budget Stabilization Reserve, often called in
shorthand the BSR, is projected to be at the 18.5 percent mark or $34.2
million by the end of 2016. That's right in the sweet spot of the Council's
policy recommendations. Compared to last year's Adopted Budget, General
Fund tax revenues increase $8.2 million in the Fiscal Year 2016 Budget.
