     DISCUSSION:
     The proposed project involves minor work in the public right-of-way (sidewalk) and does not impact the
     existing land uses along California Avenue. The improvements are intended to compliment and enhance the
     existing commercial district and are not anticipated to create any land use impacts.

     Mitigation Measures: None Required
