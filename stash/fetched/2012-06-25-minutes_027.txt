Mr. Tanczos reported the hybrid option was occurring organically throughout
the country. His company was utilizing the hybrid concept with many local
governments.

Council Member Klein asked if any cities had completed their projects.

Mr. Tanczos indicated his company was working with a number of
communities in south Florida to provide a macro cell and DAS solution for
two carriers.

Council Member Klein asked for the names of two cities that would discuss
their experiences with similar projects.

Mr. Tanczos was not directly involved in that project, but could forward a list
of cities in south Florida.

Council Member Klein asked for the names of the cities in south Florida.

Mr. Tanczos did not know the names of cities.

Council Member Klein inquired about problems that had occurred with
projects in the cities.

Mr. Tanczos stated the issues were community feedback and carriers
deploying technology in a community-friendly manner.

Council Member Klein inquired about cooperation from carriers.

Mr. Tanczos reported his company worked with the carriers consistently and
received a great deal of cooperation. Carriers were open to anything that
provided certainty with a solution.

Council Member Klein asked if existing DAS            installations   would   be
incorporated into the solution or stand outside it.

Mr. Tanczos stated the DAS installations were not incorporated in this
solution; although, many nodes in the hybrid solution would overlap with
some of AT&T's nodes. He did not believe the proposal would impact AT&T's
plans. However, other carries would consider using a macro cell rather than
a small cell.

Council Member Klein asked for the typical cost of this type of program and
what the City could expect with regard to revenue.
