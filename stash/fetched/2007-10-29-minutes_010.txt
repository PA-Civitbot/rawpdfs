Mr. Roberts stated they had not looked at the other potential recreational
use of the site.

Council Member Kleinberg asked whether we were trying to resolve the Los
Altos Water Treatment Plant property.

Mr. Roberts stated she was correct.

Council Member Kleinberg asked that since that property was less than an
acre potentially could that provide a staging area.

Mr. Roberts stated it was possible for the long range. It was not possible for
the timeline to complete by January 2009.

Council Member Kleinberg asked whether a compromise could be made to
make it a limited recommendation in terms of a timeframe and to return to
Council when there were more options available.

Mr. Roberts stated it was possible with an incremental cost of relocation.

Council Member Drekmeier asked regarding recommendation number three
which was related to private streets and alleys what the additional surcharge
rate of $846.76 annually was for.

Mr. Roberts stated it was the cost per household to pay for the smaller truck
and driver to come around to have access to the houses.

Council Member Drekmeier asked whether the garbage people were paid by
the job versus by the hour.

Mr. Roberts stated they were paid on an hourly rate based on an eight-hour
day. If they completed their jobs ahead of schedule, they were released
when they were completed.

Council Member Drekmeier asked whether it would remain the same with
the hourly rate.

Mr. Roberts stated the current PASCO work force was paid more than the
prevailing rate for the hourly pay.

Council Member Drekmeier asked about recommendation number six stating
the commercial composting would start in 2009 to be processed at a
regional facility. If the Council decided not to compost in Palo Alto then yard
waste would move offsite.

Mr. Roberts stated he was correct.
