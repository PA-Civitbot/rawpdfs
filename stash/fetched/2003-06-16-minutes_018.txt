     CIP (PG04010) for $155,000 in 2003-04. This CIP seeks to determine
     which fields are most appropriate for the installation of artificial turf
     and lighting, and then implement over a five-year period. Staff will
     make an Athletic Fields presentation to Council on June 23, 2003.

     The Finance Committee recommends the City Council direct staff to
     increase by $50,000 funding for Local and Neighborhood Collector
     Street Traffic Calming CIP (PL00026). The Finance Committee
     recommended increasing the funding of this project to $150,000 for
     additional traffic calming project work. This additional funding is from
     the Street Improvement Fund.

     The Finance Committee recommends the City Council direct staff to
     reduce the proposed 2003-04 Appeals fee increase from $200 to $120.
     The Finance Committee felt the increase from $100 to $200 was
     excessive and recommended to fee to be $120 in 2003-04. This
     motion does not change the CSD budget in 2003-04.

     The Finance Committee recommends the City Council direct staff to
     reinstate the Picnic Area Reservation fee. The Finance Committee felt
     it was important to reinstate the picnic area reservation service and
     related fees, with signage describing the enforcement options
     available. This motion does not change the CSD budget in 2003-04.

     The Finance Committee recommends the City Council direct staff to
     eliminate the proposed 2003-04 $2 Baylands Parking Lot Day Use Fee.
     This motion reduces annual General Fund revenue by $18,000 in
     2003-04 and 2004-05.

     The Finance Committee recommends the City Council adopt the 2003-
     04 Budget and the 2004-05 in-concept budgets as modified.
