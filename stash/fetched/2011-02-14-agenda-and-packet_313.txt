III.   Motions, Debate & Voting

       A. Policy. It is the policy of the Council to follow simplified rules of parliamentary
       procedure for motions, debate and voting. These rules focus on the types of motions
       the Council can debate and when those motions are properly used.

              1. Purpose. The purpose of these rules to facilitate orderly and thorough
              discussion and debate of Council business. These rules shall not be applied
              or used to create strategic advantage or unjust results.

              2. Summary of Rules. . Palo Alto does not follow Roberts Rules of Order.
              See the Summary Table below.




                                                                                                              Attachment: 2.15.11 (1422 : Policy and Services Agenda 2/15/2011)
       B. Motions. A motion is a formal proposal by a Council Member asking that the
       Council take a specified action. A motion must receive a second before the Council
       can consider a matter. Matters returning to the Council with unanimous approval
       from a standing committee will be introduced without a motion if directed by the
       committee.

              1. Types of motions. There are two kinds of motions. These are the
              “main” motion and any secondary motions. Only one main motion can be
              considered at a time.

              2. Procedure.

                      a) Get the Floor. A Council Member must receive the permission
                      of the Mayor (or other presiding officer) before making a motion.

                      b) State the Motion. A motion is made by a Council Member (the
                      “maker”) stating his or her proposal. Longer proposals can be
                      written and may be in the form of a resolution.

                      c) Second Required. Any other Council Member (including the
                      presiding officer) who supports the proposal (or who simply wishes
                      it to be considered) may “second” the motion without first being
                      recognized. A motion to raise a question of personal privilege does
                      not require a second.

                      d) Motion Restated. The Mayor should restate the motion for the
                      record, particularly if it is long or complex.
