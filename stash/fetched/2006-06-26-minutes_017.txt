12A. (Old Item 3) Council Direction for Police Auditor Selection Process

Vice Mayor Kishimoto said the staff report had mentioned two
proposals but there were three. The third was not received on time
due to failure of Federal Express delivery and she asked staff to
elaborate on failure of the delivery.

Assistant City Manager Emily Harrison said the transport issue was
through no fault of the applicant.

Vice Mayor Kishimoto asked whether she could make a motion to
accept staffâ€™s recommendation and to amend evaluating three
proposals instead of two.

City Attorney Gary Baum said it was acceptable to waive the procedural
defect on the timing delay to allow the third proposal to be considered.

Herb Borock, P.O. Box 632, said the Brown Act required interviews be
held in open session for independent contractors that were not
employees, and a closed session for independent contractors who acted
as officers or employees.

MOTION: Vice Mayor Kishimoto moved, seconded by Cordell, to
confirm the process outlined in the staff report for selection of a police
auditor and waive any procedural defects to allow the third application
received for the police auditor.

MOTION PASSED 8-0, Morton absent.

Council Member Cordell left the meeting at 10:05 p.m.
