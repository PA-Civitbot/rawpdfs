Mayor Scharff: I'm confused. Isn't the Monday the 12th—I mean, Monday
the 11th of August?

Vice Mayor Kniss: It starts on Monday.

Mayor Scharff: That's right, so it's the 11th. What's your Motion?

Vice Mayor Kniss: It ends on the 11th. My Motion is to start with Beth's
suggestion on July 3rd …

Mayor Scharff: And end on the 10th.

Vice Mayor Kniss: Yeah. You would not be meeting on Monday obviously.
You would return for a Council meeting on the 11th of August.

Mayor Scharff: The 11th is a Monday.

Council Member Holman: My calendar is the 11th of August is a Friday.

Vice Mayor Kniss: Are you looking at the 2017 August calendar?

Council Member Holman: Yes, I am. On my Google calendar.

Mayor Scharff: We're looking at the one here. Is this one wrong?

Council Member Holman: The 14th is Monday.

Vice Mayor Kniss: Then the 14th is perfect.

Mayor Scharff: Beth gave us the wrong calendar.

Ms. Minor: August 14th is a Monday, and that is when we would return.

Mayor Scharff: We'd end on the 13th. When would we start? When would
the break start?

Ms. Minor: July 3rd.

Mayor Scharff: July 3rd, so we'd have a meeting on the 3rd?

Ms. Minor: No. No meeting on the 3rd.

Vice Mayor Kniss: Therefore, doesn't it make more sense to talk about the
summer break being from July 2nd instead of July 3rd?

Mayor Scharff: Or July 1st.
