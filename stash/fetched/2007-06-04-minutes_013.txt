Council Member Cordell stated all those in violation of the Ordinance should
be asked to move. If a person were blocking the sidewalk whether lying or
sitting, this Ordinance would be enforced fairly and equally.

Council Member Drekmeier asked how strictly this was enforced.

Ms. Johnson stated they would be asked to move if they were in the area
currently covered by the Ordinance.

Council Member Morton stated the Ordinance would continue to grow and
eventually extend to be a Citywide Ordinance and he was conflicted on how
he would vote.

Council Member Kleinberg said by deleting Section A of the Ordinance, it
would state, “Sitting or lying down on the sidewalks of this unusually busy
area.” She asked for clarification.

Council Member Cordell stated language would have to be added.

Council Member Kleinberg asked whether panhandling being prohibited in
one area, would cause it to continue to move to different parts of the City.

Ms. Johnson stated it was possible, but the downtown area where there was
more traffic was generally where panhandling happened. She stated there
are other programs they are working on which will help un-housed people.

Council Member Kleinberg asked what would happen with businesses from
the hours of 8 am to 11 am if the Ordinance were enforced from the hours of
11 am to 11 pm.

Ms. Johnson stated the sitting and lying would not be prohibited.

Council Member Kleinberg stated there was question of legality of the same
activity at the same place considered unsafe because of the hour of the day.
She stated she would support the Ordinance with reluctance.

Vice Mayor Klein questioned whether Palo Alto was strict enough considering
the amount of people un-housed. He supported this Ordinance and asked
whether “strict enforcement” would be included in the language.

Council Member Cordell stated it was not part of the Ordinance but was part
of her verbiage.
