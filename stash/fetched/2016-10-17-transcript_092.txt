Vice Mayor Scharff: I think you should put it in the Motion, Karen, so we
don't forget.

Council Member Holman: Put it in the Motion?

Vice Mayor Scharff: Yeah. Everything else is listed out pretty clearly.

Council Member Holman:      We'll add window treatments, prohibit reflective
glass.

Vice Mayor Scharff: Yes.

Council Member Holman: Liz?

Council Member Kniss: That's fine.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to add to the Motion, “prohibit window treatments
made of reflective glass.” (New Part D)

Council Member Holman: Lobby size, that also needs to be addressed. An
amendment would be to ask Staff to come back with a recommendation on
lobby size. That's accepted by the Vice Mayor with a nod.

Vice Mayor Scharff: Yes.

Council Member Holman: Council Member Kniss? Okay.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to add to the Motion, “direct Staff to return with a
recommendation on lobby size.” (New Part E)

Council Member Holman: Basements, I'll leave that for the Mayor to
address. Hours of operation, are you looking for recommendations or are
you going to come back with recommendations? What's your preference?

Mr. Lait: If you have something now, that could help us move this along.
Otherwise, we would come back with some recommendations.

Council Member Holman: If I could propose this, just put it out there,
somebody else can change it or not. I would suggest for hours of operation
that a minimum of six hours a day and five days a week.

Vice Mayor Scharff: No.
