MOTION: Council Member Ojakian moved, seconded by Kleinberg, to accept
the staff recommended amendments on page 2 of CMR: 449:03 with one
exception to the second bullet, change “mandatory” to “voluntary” unpaid
furlough, and report back to the Council in January 2004 regarding the
ability to reach the budgeted dollar amount of $322,000.

Council Member Ojakian said staff would track unpaid time and report back
to Council in January to reach the dollar amount of 822 days with a
$322,000 threshold.

Council Member Kleinberg asked what the estimated administrative cost
would be.

Mr. Benest said it was immense with Human Resources and Administrative
Services.

Director of Human Resources Leslie Loomis said SEIU did not want their
overtime impacted. They had two different options; take the days off
without pay or take a 1 percent salary reduction. The members came up
with a savings of $456,000 in pledges. The Manager’s 1 percent savings
equated to $320,000. Pledge cards would be issued and the dollar amount
calculated.

Mr. Benest said there were some Management and Professional employees
who received overtime.

Ms. Loomis said the Management and Professional employees who received
overtime would have an overtime impact.

achieved overtime.

overtime.
