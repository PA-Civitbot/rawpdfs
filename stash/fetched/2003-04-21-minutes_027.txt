was removed. He appreciated the continuation of having the public speak to
Consent Calendar items that the Council had not removed. Former Mayor
Simitian set up the procedure and he referred to colleagues by title and last
name without having any protocols. The Consent Calendar process should
be very simple, Council Members either wanted to remove an item or
members of the public wanted to speak. He suggested that Council review
how the previous Council dealt with the Consent Calendar.

Arthur Keller, 3881 Corina Way, said one of the program proposals had
about 97% going for wind and about 2-3 % going for full voltage power. He
suggested the company which supplied full voltage power be directed to
install said photo voltage power within the confines of the City and not
elsewhere. That would reduce the need for transporting power into the City,
which would have losses in transmission as well as additional costs. He was
pleased the program was designed to break even to the extent that if there
was any surplus generated, he suggested the surplus go toward installing
additional photo voltage power on City facilities.

Council Member Kishimoto registered a “no” vote on Item No. 10.
