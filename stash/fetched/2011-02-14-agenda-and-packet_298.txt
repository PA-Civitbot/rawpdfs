                                        1) Oral communications may be used only to address items
                                        that are within the Councilâ€™s subject matter jurisdiction, but
                                        not listed on the agenda.

                                        2) Oral communications may not be used to address matters
                                        where the receipt of new information would threaten the due
                                        process rights of any person.

                                        3) All remarks shall be addressed to the Council as a body
                                        and not to any individual member.

                                        4) Council members shall not enter into debate or discussion
                                        with speakers during oral communications.




                                                                                                                       Attachment: 2.15.11 (1422 : Policy and Services Agenda 2/15/2011)
                                        5) The presiding officer may direct that the City Manager
                                        will respond to the person speaking and/or the Council at a
                                        later date.

                              b) Other Agenda Items. Public comments or testimony on agenda
                              items other than Oral Communications shall be limited to a
                              maximum of three minutes per speaker unless additional time is
                              granted by the presiding officer. The presiding officer may reduce
                              the allowed time to less than two minutes if necessary to
                              accommodate a larger number of speakers.

                                        1) Spokesperson for a Group. When any group of people
                                        wishes to address the Council on the same subject matter, the
                                        presiding officer will request that a spokesperson be chosen
                                        by the group to address the Council. Spokespersons who are
                                        representing a group of five or more people who are present
                                        in the Council chambers will be allowed ten minutes and will
                                        to the extent practical be called upon ahead of individual
                                        speakers.

                                        2) Quasi-Judicial Hearings. In the case of a quasi-judicial
                                        hearing, single applicants and appellants shall be given ten
                                        minutes for their opening presentation and three minutes for
                                        rebuttal before the hearing is closed. In the case of a quasi-
                                        judicial hearing for which there are two or more appellants,
                                        the time allowed for presentation and rebuttal shall be
                                        divided among all appellants, and the total time allowed for
                                        all appellants shall be a total of twenty minutes for the
                                        opening presentation and six minutes for rebuttal before the
