3.   Selection of Candidates to be Interviewed for the Historic Resources
     Board for One Unexpired Term Ending on May 31, 2014 and Three
     Terms Expiring on May 31, 2016.

MOTION: Council Member Kniss moved to interview all of the applicants.

MOTION FAILED DUE TO THE LACK OF A SECOND

MOTION: Council Member Klein moved, seconded by Mayor Scharff to: 1)
place on the April 8, 2013 Consent Calendar, the appointment of the three
incumbents; David Bower, Beth Bunnenberg, and Patricia DiCicco to the
three terms expiring on May 31, 2016; and 2) schedule an interview with
Margaret Wimmer for the unexpired term ending on May 31, 2014.

Council Member Klein felt the three incumbent applicants had performed
well; therefore, there was no purpose in interviewing them. Because he did
not know Ms. Wimmer, he felt she should be interviewed as part of the
Council's due diligence responsibility.

Mayor Scharff inquired whether Council Member Klein meant to interview
Ms. Wimmer for the unexpired term.

Council Member Klein answered yes.

Council Member Holman supported the Motion.
