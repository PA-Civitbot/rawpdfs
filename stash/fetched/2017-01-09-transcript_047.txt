Council Member Holman: You don't want to vote on anybody tonight.

Vice Mayor Kniss: I want to vote on Historic Resources Board.

Council Member Holman: I hear you.

Vice Mayor Kniss: But not Parks and Rec.

Mayor Scharff: I see no second. Now, I have Council Member Tanaka.

MOTION FAILED DUE TO THE LACK OF A SECOND

Council Member Tanaka:     I partially support that, but I guess we're not
postponing both.

Mayor Scharff: You need to make the Motion. That's the way it works. Is
that the Motion you're making?

Council Member Tanaka: I'd like to make a Motion, yes.

Mayor Scharff: Go ahead.

Council Member Tanaka: I'd like to make the Motion to postpone both Parks
and Rec and Historic Resources Board.

Mayor Scharff: And to go out to a date uncertain and open the recruitment
of the PRC.

Council Member Tanaka: Exactly.

Mayor Scharff: And open the recruitment of both of them.

Council Member Tanaka: Exactly.

Mayor Scharff: Do we have a second for Council Member Tanaka's â€¦

Council Member Fine: I'll second that.

MOTION: Council Member Tanaka moved, seconded by Council Member
Fine to continue this Agenda Item to a date uncertain and reopen
recruitment for both the Parks and Recreation Commission and the Historic
Resources Board.

Mayor Scharff: Seconded by Council Member Fine. I'm going to clear the
board because everyone has lights on. I want to make sure you're speaking
to that. I'll give it a second.
