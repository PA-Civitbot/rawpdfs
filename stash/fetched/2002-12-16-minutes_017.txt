Council Member Beecham said in reviewing the drawings he did not think the
monument would be an obstruction that would prevent light from entering
the tunnel.

Council Member Kishimoto suggested placing the monument on axis with
Homer Avenue by leaving it in its exact location.

Mr. Emslie said suggestions and preferences such as safety; lighting issues
and visual nature would all be taken into account in deciding the ultimate
placement of the monument.

Council Member Beecham restated the motion to send the item back to staff
for the ARB and staff to review and to take into account safety and
integration with the overall design in the monument’s final placement on
axis with Homer Avenue.

Council Member Kishimoto said not to necessarily send the item back to the
ARB but review with the architect the placement of the monument.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION BY THE MAKER AND SECONDER
that Council return the item to staff for review with the architect of precise
location of the monument with the direction: 1) to have the alignment on
axis with Homer Avenue; 2) for staff to take into consideration safety,
including security lighting; and 3) for the appropriate integration of the
monument with the existing design.

Mr. Emslie said modifications to the design would need to be dealt with at
staff level due to a tight timeframe.

Council Member Kleinberg asked to include appropriate security lighting in
the design.

Mayor Ojakian referred to the monument/fence post as a gift. As a gift from
a prior council member, the public should know that it should be maintained
and kept in perpetuity.

Council Member Lytle asked if by keeping the monument on alignment would
it be a visual terminus and seen from Homer Avenue.

Mayor Ojakian said that was the intent.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION PASSED 8-1, Burch “no.”
