Council Member Burch said occasionally there were some people who only
reported to one person.

AMENDMENT PASSED 9-0.

AMENDMENT: Council Member Ojakian moved, seconded by Freeman, to
direct the City Manager to report back to the Finance Committee on how
printing and mailing funds could be reduced.

Council Member Ojakian said printing and mailing funds was a classic area
whose overhead did not provide services to resident or non-resident users.
Although a large portion of the cost was the mailing of the utility bills, it was
still an area worth looking at. The idea of outsourcing needed to be vetted,
as well as keeping in line with sustainability concepts and policies.

Council Member Freeman said she was glad to see the printing and mailing
issue resurface.

Council Member Lytle said printing and mailing funds was a legitimate place
to look for cost reductions.

Council Member Kleinberg agreed with Council Member Ojakian. She asked
whether the intent of the amendment included looking across the board at
all cuts, not just how to reduce it, but whether actual mailings were
unnecessary.

Council Member Ojakian said he had phrased the amendment in such a way
as to allow staff the latitude to return with different avenues and options.

AMENDMENT PASSED 8-1, Morton “no.”

Council Member Kishimoto said there were a number of CIP's she wanted to
register a "no" vote on. She asked whether she could express that at the
time of the general vote.

Mayor Mossar said yes.

Council Member Lytle said she wanted to register a “no” vote on El Camino
Park.

Mayor Mossar said she believed the Council could vote on the main motion
with the Finance Committee recommendations and amendments. After
which, "no" votes and "not participating" votes could be taken.
