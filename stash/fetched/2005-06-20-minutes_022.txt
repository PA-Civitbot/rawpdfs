and non-residents.

Council Member Morton said he did not believe the City could collect the
amount staff had budgeted, and felt it would damage more people than it
helped.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION: Council Member Morton moved, seconded by
Kleinberg, to delete the park fee from the current budget and to deduct
$25,000 from the fee collection stations.

Council Member Morton said he did not believe it made economic sense.

Vice Mayor Kleinberg said there was a fundamental principal about the
enjoyment of Palo Alto’s parks and Baylands, and believed they should remain
free.

Council Member Freeman concurred with Vice Mayor Kleinberg’s comments.

Council Member Kishimoto clarified the park volunteers would be exempt from
having to pay a fee.

Director of Community Services Richard James replied yes.

Council Member Kishimoto expressed support for the original motion. She felt it
was a structural issue the Council would face again in the future.

Council Member Mossar expressed support for the original motion. The
community paid to acquire the open space lands, but had not paid to maintain
them. The City needed to accept its stewardship responsibility for its open
space holdings.

Council Member Beecham expressed support for the substitute motion.

Council Member Cordell expressed support for the substitute motion.

Mayor Burch said he had frequented a number of community and regional parks
and trails without having a pay a fee. He expressed support for the substitute
motion.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION PASSED 7-2, Kishimoto, Mossar no.
