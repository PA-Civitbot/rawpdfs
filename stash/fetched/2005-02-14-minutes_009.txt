COUNCIL MATTERS

7.   Colleagues Memo from Vice Mayor Kleinberg and Council Member
     Mossar Reporting Back to Council on Potential Grant Monies Available
     for the Purchase of the Peninsula Open Space Trust Arastradero
     Gateway Property for Open Space Preservation

Council Member Mossar said the California Coastal Commission Conservancy
and the Santa Clara County Parks Charter Funds had each pledged
$1,000,000; the goal was $3,600,000.

MOTION: Council Member Mossar moved, seconded by Kleinberg, to direct
staff to provide information to the Council about possible trail alignments,
consistent with the Comprehensive Plan, to satisfy the critical pedestrian
trial connections that would link the trailhead at the Gateway property to the
San Francisco Ridge Trail. Because of the urgency of these funding
opportunities with the Santa Clara County and Coastal Conservancy to
provide a significant portion of the acquisition amount, we ask that the
Council agendize a discussion and possible action on a funding agreement as
soon as possible.

Vice Mayor Kleinberg acknowledged the efforts of Council Member Mossar,
Assistant City Manager Emily Harrison, City Manager Frank Benest, and
Open Space and Science Division Manager Gregg Betts.

Council Member Morton asked whether the trail alignment would give access
to parts of Foothills Park.

Council Member Mossar said the trail alignment was the subject for
discussion.
