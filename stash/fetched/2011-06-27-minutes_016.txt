Mr. Bobel did not believe the City would have to give up rate-setting
authority because of the financing.

Mr. Binder agreed and noted that the City would be charged by the private
entity per ton of delivered material, but the rates for residents would be set

Vice Mayor Yeh asked if some of the operating costs would be determined by
the external entity.

Mr. Binder noted that whatever the cost per ton would be, it would include

Mayor Espinosa asked about mitigations that San Jose was considering and

Mr. Bobel stated that Staff could not estimate the mitigation costs.

Mayor Espinosa noted that they would receive feedback from the City
Attorneyâ€™s Office on the issue of limiting the use of the land through ballot
language and how that will affect rent rates on the land. He asked where
people could go to see examples of this type of facility.

Mr. Binder replied that the best facilities were in Europe, but in the feasibility
reports were photos of reference facilities from all companies that responded
to the RFI.

Mayor Espinosa asked if there were any local places that were similar. He
