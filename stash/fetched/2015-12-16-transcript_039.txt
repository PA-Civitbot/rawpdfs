                         TRANSCRIPT
Ms. Figone: What we have in the yellow matrix, if you look at your
Attachment 2, because we were new in working together, we plugged in a
mid-cycle debrief.

Chair Burt: I don't think we need that.

Council Member Kniss: I think we're okay.

Ms. Figone: We won't even put that on the schedule.

Chair Burt: Four heads nodding.

Council Member Kniss: Could I interrupt for a second? (inaudible) has
walked in. I have a feeling there must be another meeting happening here
later. Is there?

Chair Burt: Next.

Ms. Figone: The final is Item D. This is about mapping next year and the
timeline. Tighten up the schedule.

Vice Mayor Schmid: You had suggested tightening the schedule.

Ms. Figone: Tightening up the schedule and establishing the calendar by
May, get things out there.

Chair Burt: I tossed out those tentative timelines, and everybody seemed to
be okay with that.

Ms. Egan: Everything in advance of your break, with interviews afterwards.
We'd have a draft ready. We can do that.

Ms. Figone; You'll keep your midyear check-in. It will be informal. We'll
put it on next year's calendar, but your internal champion should help you
with the Clerk to make sure that happens. Thank you.

Chair Burt: Thank you all.

ADJOURNMENT: Meeting adjourned at 6:06 P.M.
