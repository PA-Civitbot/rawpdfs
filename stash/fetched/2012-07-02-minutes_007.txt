CITY MANAGER COMMENTS

City Manager, James Keene reported the 31st Annual Summer Festival and
Chili Cook-Off was scheduled for July 4, 2012, 12:00 P.M. to 5:00 P.M. at
Mitchell Park. As of July 1, 2012 the sales tax in Santa Clara increased from
8.25 percent to 8.375 percent as a result of the 2008 Bay Area Rapid Transit
(BART) measure. A community survey had been placed on the City's
website to gather feedback about Rinconada Park. Information gathered
from the survey would be used to guide the design of a Long Range Plan.
Staff anticipated presenting Plan proposals to the Council in late October
2012.
