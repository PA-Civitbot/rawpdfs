DATE:        November 22, 2010

TO:          City Council

FROM:        Donna Grider, City Clerk

SUBJECT:     Agenda Item 16 - Recommendation from the Policy &
             Services Committee to the City Council on Proposed
             Changes to the City Council Procedures and Protocols


In an effort to help streamline Council’s discussion on this complex item, I have
attempted to divide the items that may warrant further discussion from those that
were ministerial in nature or updating existing practice.

Potential for Further Discussion

Procedures

 • Page II-4/II-5 – add section c) Late Submittal of Planning Application
   Materials. In order to allow for adequate staff review and analysis and to
   ensure public access to materials, all plans and other applicant materials
   related to Planning applications being heard by the City Council must be
   submitted not later than noon 5 working days prior to the release of the
   Council agenda packet. This includes materials delivered to staff or to
   Council Members either before or during the meeting. If items are not
   submitted by this date or if staff determines additional review is needed, staff
   will reschedule the item to a future Council meeting. Additionally, if there are
   significant changes, staff will analyze whether the need exists to continue the
   item.
