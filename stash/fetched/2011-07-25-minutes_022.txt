14.   Finance Committee Recommendation for Rate Increases for the FY
      2012 Refuse Fund Budget.

Interim Public Works Director, Mike Sartor, stated that Council had approved
the FY 2012 Budget with a $3,700,000 deficit in the Refuse Fund. He
explained that Staff had met with the Finance Committee on July 5, 2011,
and again several weeks later on July 19, 2011, to develop the Staff
recommendation for the Item.

Assistant Environmental Services Director, Phil Bobel, explained that Staff
had mapped out a long-term phased strategy to help the Refuse Fund to
achieve a $3,000,000 operating reserve, to ensure that all ratepayer
categories paid their actual costs, and to fully implement structural rate
changes within the next three to five years. He explained that Staff had also
developed a short-term strategy, which was well under way. He stated that
the next step in the short-term plan was to begin the Proposition 218
process for approval of new rates with a 45-day notice. He stated that after
the Proposition 218 process, Staff would return to Council in September
2011 for approval of rates. The rates would take effect October 1, 2011. He
explained that Staff had met several times with the Finance Committee, who
had recommended approval of a $1,250,000 loan from the General Fund to
the Refuse Fund in order to reduce rate increases and create a viable two-
year plan. Another of the Finance Committee recommendations was to
continue the approved rate increases from last year for both residential and
commercial customers, and to approve an additional residential fixed rate in
the amount of $4.62 per month.

Solid Waste Program Manager, Brad Eggleston, reviewed the FY 2010
expense actuals for the Refuse Fund, noting that the GreenWaste contract
represented approximately 40 percent of all expenses. He stated that the
landfill closure would significantly reduce expenses for the Refuse Fund in FY
2013. He explained that the reduction in expenses and the proposed
$1,250,000 loan from the General Fund constituted a two-year smoothing
strategy that would help minimize the rate increases for FY 2012 and avoid
additional rate increases in FY 2013. He stated that in order to achieve those
goals, Staff would need to institute a revenue increase in conjunction with
the proposed loan. He stated that while Staff proposed to continue the six
and nine percent commercial rate increases from the previous year, they
