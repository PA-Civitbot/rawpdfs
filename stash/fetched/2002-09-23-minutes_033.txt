Mayor Ojakian said the motion from Council Member Kishimoto
was to direct the architect to dedicate the piece of land
that was currently not parkland.

Mr. Calonne said staff would return with a discussion of
dedication,   which  might  include  a   City  Manager’s
recommendation.

Mayor Ojakian said staff would be directed to agendize the
item and return with pros and cons.

Mr. Calonne said that was correct. The PARC might have a
role to play and should not be left out.

Council Member    Kishimoto   accepted   the   City   Attorney’s
suggestion.

Mr. Calonne said the rubber met the road when the design
was sufficiently advanced to support a park improvement
ordinance. The control point for the Council was approval
of a park improvement ordinance that had relatively
specific diagrams, plans, and layouts for what would be
constructed. That was an important control point for the
Council and the public because the park improvement process
was designed to be referendable in the case the public did
not like the structure.

MOTION PASSED 8-1, Beecham “no.”

City Manager Benest requested that Item No. 8 be removed
from the agenda at the request of staff.
