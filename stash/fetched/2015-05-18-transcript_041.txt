Council Member Scharff: The nature of your business.

Ms. Oommen: Blossom is a registered not-for-profit organization. We're
registered and have been in Palo Alto for 16 years, ever since our inception.
We serve the local community with classes and resources for expectant
couples and new families. We're a nonprofit on this street.

Ms. Gitelman: It sounds like an office use.

Ms. Oommen: We have a resale store within our store as well. We are on
the first floor, but with steps set back from the street.

Council Member Scharff: They have classes. That's where I was picking up

I think they mean things like the Kelly-Moore Paint Store. It's been there a
long time. It's not a hardware store, but it's in that sort of thing when
people talk about it. Have we thought about maybe limiting the formula
retail issue to restaurants and eating establishments? Is there any reason
we couldn't do that?

Mr. Lait: No reason that the Council couldn't go down that path.

Council Member Scharff: When we think about formula retail that's not
eating establishments or drinking establishments, do we have any indication
thatâ€”formula retail that people think about are things like the Gap or, I
