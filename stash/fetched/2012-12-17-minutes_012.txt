2012 the amount was up to $22 million; there was a projected $23 million in
FY 2013. The Documentary Transfer Tax dropped to a low of $3.1 million in

Center received a steady volume of permit applications to process, and

percent since 2007. The average number of days for Plan Checks had a 37
percent improvement this past year. The City hired Development Center
