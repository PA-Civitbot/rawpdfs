                     FINAL MINUTES
Ms. Van Der Zwaag indicated that decision was within the Council's
discretion. New needs were brought to the attention of the HRC when it
conducted the supplemental needs assessment.

Council Member Berman stated the Finance Committee understood that
different projects could be funded.

Council Member Klein requested the Finance Committee's reasons for using
agencies' requests for funding as one factor to determine the $200,000
amount.

Council Member Burt explained that it was half of the unfunded requests by
the agencies.

Council Member Berman reported $200,000 was the full amount. The
Finance Committee was searching for logic in setting a cap. That number
was determined as a logical, maximum amount. The Council was free to
disagree with the $200,000 amount set by the Finance Committee.

Ms. Van Der Zwaag clarified that $200,000 was the difference in the amount
that the 14 smaller agencies requested and were funded. It did not include
requests by and funding for PACCC and Avenidas.

Council Member Klein asked if the Finance Committee considered the
amount requested compared to the amount allocated to the smaller
agencies. Some agencies received 100 percent of their requests and some
received less than 25 percent.

Council Member Berman noted the Finance Committee briefly discussed it in
the context that the ceiling of $200,000 did not break down to individual
agencies.    For example, DreamCatchers requested $55,000 and was
allocated $8,000. The Finance Committee did not state that DreamCatchers
could receive an additional $47,000.

Council Member Klein asked if the Finance Committee had any doubt that
the full $200,000 would be allocated.

Council Member Berman stated a few Finance Committee Members wanted
to stress to the HRC that $200,000 was a cap.

Mayor Shepherd asked if the Finance Committee recommended the Council
approve funding for the second year of the two-year cycle.

Ms. Van Der Zwaag believed the Finance Committee postponed that issue
until the Council could hold the current discussion.
