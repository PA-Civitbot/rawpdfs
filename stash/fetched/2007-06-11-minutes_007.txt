Council Member Kleinberg asked the City Attorney to explain the exemptions
for non-profits.

Mr. Baum stated the increase was a fee for services used and could not be
exempted.

Council Member Kleinberg asked how the above mentioned non-profit had
been exempted from tax increases previously.

Mr. Baum stated it was possible the organization had been exempted from a
parcel tax. The increase was a cost recovery for services.

Council Member Kleinberg asked whether the law permitted discounts to
non-profits or other classifications.

Mr. Baum stated the difficulty was the Proposition 218 process; the entity or
individual must be charged for the cost of the provided services.

Council Member Kleinberg stated the increased fees were forcing a core
safety net of services and lower income residents to leave town.

Mr. Auzenne stated there were two programs in place; Project Pledge which
was dollars donated by the community to assist lower income individuals
with utility bills and General Low Income Program which was in conjunction
with the County of Santa Clara.

Council Member Kleinberg asked whether the programs applied to water,
refuse, and waste.

Mr. Auzenne stated he was uncertain whether refuse was included.

Council Member Kleinberg asked whether non-profits were included in the
programs.

Mr. Auzenne stated he knew of no program available for non-profit
organizations.

Mr. Baum questioned the legality of subsidizing non-profits by the previously
mentioned programs.

MOTION PASSED 9-0.
