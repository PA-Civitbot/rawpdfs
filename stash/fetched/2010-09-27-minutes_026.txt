Ms. Grider said it was.

MOTION: Council Member Holman moved, seconded by Council Member
Shepherd to continue publishing Council Agenda ads in the newspaper with
adding to the City Clerks budget up to $20,000 in funds to come out of
Council Contingency Account.

Mayor Burt needed clarification on the Motion and asked if the intent was to
also propose change in the language for publication.

Council Member Holman said the Motion was to continue the historic practice
of the publication.

Council Member Shepherd said she realized the trend was leaning toward
putting information online but for now preferred the agenda’s be published
in the local newspaper. She supported the Motion

Mayor Burt said the City Clerk had stated the $20,000 was not adequate and
asked if the Motion was being modified.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION to change the budget amount from
$20,000 to $35,000.

Mr. Keene needed clarification on where the $35,000 would be coming from.

Mayor Burt said that should be part of the Motion.

Ms. Grider confirmed it was from the Council Contingency Fund.

Council Member Holman said she was comfortable with that option.

Council Member Shepherd thought $39,000 remained in the fund.

Mr. Keene said it could immediately be taken from Council Contingency or
the Council could give direction to do a review during the mid-year budget
process.
