the existing color.

Mr. Williams stated that the concern on the Commission was that the
existing color of the other structures is not appropriate.

Council Member Burt stated his clarification that the existing color of the
home is something that would not currently be permitted.

Mr. Williams stated that was correct.

Council Member Burt asked for clarification of the Open Space Guidelines in
regard to the color of structures.

Mr. Williams stated that the guidelines allow that to be included and has
typically been done for a new home or something that is very visible. The
enforcement mechanism has been requiring the color to be approved
through a condition of approval. In this case, the Applicant provided a
revised color to comply with this condition.

Council Member Burt stated that he wanted the record to reflect that Council
is not supporting a position that color cannot be a condition in Open Space
District development.
