Council Member Burt: Why don't we say "a goal of ...

Council Member DuBois:      A ubiquitous fiber network reaching nearly all
residences?

Council Member Burt: "Nearly all." Let's just put it there for right now as a
placeholder.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to add to the Motion Part A, “reaching nearly all
residents” after “Palo Alto.”

Council member Burt: The other question I had is—I think it's on your—no.
You've got a "B(b)." Anyway, under "D," wireless plan will not use Fiber
funds. Are you saying that we wouldn't use any of our, in this motion, any
of our $20 million toward expanding wireless?

Council Member DuBois: At this time, yes. The Safety, I believe—it wasn't
clear where that money would come from. We're currently paying for
Verizon and wireless communications in Public Safety. I just want to shift
that budget to cover this. The expansion in the parks, again I'm basically
saying we should get more details before we start spending the 20 million.

Council Member Burt: First, "D" is meaning only at this time.       It's not a
future direction?

Council Member DuBois: Yes.

Council Member Burt: If we could add that language, "at this time," to "D."
Is that acceptable?

Council Member DuBois: Yes.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to add to the Motion at the end of Part D, “at this
time.”

Council Member Burt: I would like to add an evaluation of expanding
wireless to retail areas in North and South Palo Alto.
