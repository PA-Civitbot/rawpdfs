9:55 AM                   2.    2014 Workplan and Our Palo Alto Initiative
                          Staff presentation and Council input on the 2014 work plan
                          of key City projects and initiatives. In 30 days, the City
                          Manager will provide Council with a “Master Calendar” of
                          these projects and other anticipated items expected to
                          come before Council during the year. This calendar will
                          evolve and change but should provide a good planning
                          document for the year and help manage issues and
                          decision making. See Work Plan Draft Attachment A.
                          Council is asked to review and be prepared to make
                          suggestions (additions or deletions) to this list and
                          comment

                          Staff will also review the Our Palo Alto initiative and the
                          implications and potential emergent demands this will
                          place on Council and staff. See Attachment B, one page
                          profile.

                          enhance Council meeting efficiency and decision output,
