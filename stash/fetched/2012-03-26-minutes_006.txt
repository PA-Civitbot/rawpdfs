services. If there was a reduced level-of-service, a portion of Staff could be
maintained to conduct those types of services.

Council Member Burt inquired whether the projected net cost of $500,000 in
Fiscal Year 2013 was for the same level-of-service or for a reduced level-of-
service.

Ms. Antil responded it was for the reduced level-of-service. She stated the
comparison to SVACA indicated the primary differences were barking dog
complaints, administrative hearings, assessment reports of animal
defecation on property, and animal surrenders. She explained the City
would have to find a different way to provide those services, which would
change the savings number.

Council Member Burt stated a critical component of the Council's decision
would be understanding the cost of retaining the current level-of-service and
the services which SVACA would not provide.

Ms. Antil stated the Council could see an increase in revenue from
repurposing the property, if it chose to do so, which could be used to
recapture the gap in animal control services.

Council Member Burt asked if the $300,000 capital outlay would occur if the
City chose SVACA to provide services.

Bob Beacom, Acting Assistant Police Chief reported the $300,000 was a
capital expense to handle animals from Palo Alto. He stated that number
was based on SVACA's anticipation that it would contract with Palo Alto, Los
Altos and Los Altos Hills.

Council Member Burt inquired if the $300,000 was Palo Alto's portion, and
did not include Los Altos and Los Altos Hills.

Mr. Beacom responded that was correct.

Mr. Keene repeated that was a one-time expense.

Council Member Burt asked whether the Peninsula Humane Society served
the cities not listed under SVACA. He asked if Sunnyvale was serviced by
SVACA.
