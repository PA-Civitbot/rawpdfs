 1   included doing this independent traffic analysis, which shows that there is no or very little
 2   significant impact. So on that basis alone the data showed that we should recommend going
 3   forth in recommending to the Council a Negative Declaration.

 5   I think that it will be a great revitalization of downtown area. I have driven and bicycled down in
 6   the area in equal parts. I rarely encounter, rarely, rarely in 20 years two people going in the same
 7   direction using the two lanes. So I see that the functionality of the 1950s where it was a
 8   throughway for Alma to El Camino is no longer something that is needed. What is needed is a
 9   revitalized down California shopping area. Thank you very much.

13   Mr. Todd Burke, Palo Alto: I actually live on California Avenue. The windows of my
14   condominium at Palo Alto Central overlook the park, the beautiful bike storage lockers provided
15   by VTA. I am here on behalf of myself although I have spent a lot of time speaking with my
16   neighbors and friends and various people who use the street. I am on the street every day since I
17   live there. I am a frequent patron of many of the businesses. Although I am not an artist I
18   appreciate the Accent Arts business.
19
20   I personally am in favor of the plan. I think that there are some things that ultimately need to be
21   addressed between now and the time that construction commences. I think there are some details
22   to review, and I think the team has put together some openness for that. I also share a little bit of
23   the concern that the businesses do about an impact on them. I am hoping that the City has some
24   way of working with and negotiating certain aspects of the plan with the various businesses.
25
26   Although I am in disagreement of a number of things mentioned that might otherwise be
27   opposition. There was a comment made about who asked for it? I wholeheartedly raise my hand
28   and say I am asking for it. I live on the street. I look at the 25 to 30 year old garbage cans, and
29   bent bike lockers, and bad sign stands, and everything that could be improved about the street.
30   So I for one am an individual here standing before you mentioning that I am asking for it. I may
31   not have asked for it by the time the plan was put in place, but I am.
32
33   I also find that there are a lot of neighbors who may not be here tonight, folks who live and use
34   the street who are also in favor of seeing some level of beautification. So I am in favor of you
35   accepting the Negative Declaration and moving forward with the plan. Thanks.

37   Chair Tuma: Thank you. Ellen Fletcher followed by Terry Holzermer.

39   Ms. Ellen Fletcher, Palo Alto: I rode my bike to Mollie Stone’s last week and then was
40   approached by a lady who was gathering signatures against the project. She tried to pursued me
41   that reducing the lanes from two in each direction to one would endanger bicyclists because they
42   would have to share the lane. Well, I can assure everybody that is not going to happen. It is not
43   more – in fact the Palo Alto Bicycle Advisory Committee strongly recommends this project.
44   There wasn’t anyone on the Committee who had any doubts about the safety of the current plan.
