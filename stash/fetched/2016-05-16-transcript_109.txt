and our housing should be aligned. That's what 8,800 housing units would
be, and then the 6,000 units that's presented here. If we are going to have
one that goes really higher for the purposes of study, of 8,800, then maybe
as the second one just go with the 5,300 that's proposed in the Staff Report.
Again, I don't think that "A" is really necessary, because I think we're
already going to get that. It seems like a waste of money.

Mayor Burt: We've got to move this forward. Either ...

Council Member Wolbach: I'm going to make a friendly amendment or offer
a friendly amendment. It would actually be Option A would change to
Option C from the Staff Report and then "B" would become Option ...

Mayor Burt: I guess I want to decline. If you've got a motion you want to
try and see if you get a second on. I do need to addâ€”before you go
forward, I neglected to include Staff Recommendations B and C, which is the
approval of the contract. I assume that that's not going to be contentious
with anyone. We'll just get that on whatever we have going forward.

Council Member Wolbach: Thank you. I was going to mention that too.

Mayor Burt: The seconder, you agree?

Vice Mayor Scharff: (inaudible)

Mayor Burt: Of course.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to add to the Motion;

C.         Approve Amendment Number 5 to Contract Number C08125506 with
           PlaceWorks to add $423,814 for a total not to exceed $2,801,157 for
           completion of the Comprehensive Plan Update and associated EIR; and

D.         Amend the Fiscal Year 2016 Budget Appropriation Ordinance for the
           General Fund by:

     i.         Increasing  the  Planning    and   Community      Environment
                Department appropriation by $356,140; and

     ii.        Decreasing the Budget Stabilization Reserve by $423,814.

Council Member Wolbach: I'll offer an amendment and hopefully have a
second for it. We would change "A" to Option C from the Staff Report. "B'
would become Option C but with housing units of 8,800.
