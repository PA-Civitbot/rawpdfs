You are moving past the entrance to the existing Children’s Hospital on
Welch Road. You will see the new median strip and landscaping that is also
proposed as part of the Welch Road improvements. We are ready to turn
into the Pasteur Mall, which is the traditional entrance to the Stanford
Medical Center. School of Medicine research buildings, specifically the
Foundation in Medicine 1, 2, and 3 can be seen there on the right. On the
left in the immediate foreground is the Parking Structure 4 that won an
award from Palo Alto, as well as the hospital and clinic buildings in the
foreground. This is the FIM building and one of the trees that we have
preserved by redesigning that FIM 1. These are our future clinic buildings
adjacent to the Thomas Church Fountains that exist at the entrance to the
current hospital. This is the new five-pavilion 1.1 million square foot
Stanford Hospital, with the entrance here to the immediate right. You can
see the glass towers above the diagnostic and treatment platform looking
back towards the clinics building and courtyard that is created there at the
entry. Then you will see the parking structure in the foreground to the lower
left. So that is the photorealistic simulation.

Now we will move onto the slide show and I will speak very fast. So I want
to mention to you the four different aspects of the project Hoover Pavilion,
Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital, Stanford Hospital and Clinics, and the
School of Medicine.

Next. The slide to the left is our existing conditions slide. The slide to the
right is our proposal studied under the EIR, our base proposal.

Next. As part of our design process, we have developed a set of design
guidelines that represent the things in between the buildings that connect
developments, landscaping, paving, and such.

Next. Now we will talk about the Hoover Pavilion.

Next. You can see the upper left is the historic viewshed. That is the
characteristic we consider to be the most significant about the view to the
Hoover Pavilion at Palo Road and Quarry Road with the medical office
building and parking structure adjacent.

Next. We really studied the language of the existing Hoover Pavilion, tried
to match heights, tried to match base conditions, and then the vertical
nature of the architectural expression. So that as our architect, WR&S
characterizes it this is really an ensemble of buildings on that campus.

Next. This is a view from the shopping center parking structure looking
across Quarry Road at Hoover Pavilion. The Pavilion really is behind all
those trees.
