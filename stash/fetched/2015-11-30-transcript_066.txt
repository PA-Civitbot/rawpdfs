of you, Council Members and certainly Commissioners alike. This has not in

in public. There have been some questions that have arisen among a
variety of Council Members, certainly members of the public and expressed
by Commissioners as well. I appreciate everyone's indulgence and attitude
in addressing these difficult and easy issues combined. Thank you all very
much. If you have further questions or issues, please do channel those
through Staff or through your Chair to the Council and to the Staff, so we
can help address this and help us all move forward in a productive manner.
Thank you all so very much.
