Council Member Mossar said the Downtown Library was open on Tuesday,
Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. She confirmed that both the College
Terrace and the Downtown libraries were open four days a week.

Ms. Jennings said the College Terrace Library was open four days on a
temporary basis.

Council Member Ojakian asked Ms. Jennings what days of the week were the
libraries least used.

Ms. Jennings said the College Terrace Library had a higher circulation than
the Downtown Library. The Downtown Library visitor count was higher than
the College Terrace Library.

Council Member Ojakian asked what day of the week the Downtown Library
received the least use.

Ms. Jennings said the Downtown Library was used the least on Fridays.

Council Member Ojakian said the Fremont Library was not open on Friday,
because Friday was the day where there was little usage. He asked whether
the library was used heavily on Saturdays.

Ms. Jennings said Saturday and Sunday were heavier use days.       The
Downtown Library experience was that there was not a lot of use by the
number of individuals who came into the facility.

Council Member Ojakian asked what library had the most use.

Ms. Jennings answered the Mitchell Park Library.
