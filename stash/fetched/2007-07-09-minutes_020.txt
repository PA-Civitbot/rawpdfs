            2007 general election to increase the City’s Transient Occupancy
            Tax (TOT) from 10 to 12 percent and approve Staff
            recommendations to:
      ●     Adopt the resolution approving the ballot question language and
            directing the City Attorney to prepare an impartial analysis.
      ●     Designate up to four council members to author the argument in
            favor of the measure.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to authorize the Mayor to designate up to four
Council Members to author the argument in favor of the measure.

Vice Mayor Klein said he did not expect to see a decrease in the hotel
occupancy in the City due to a two percent increase in the TOT.

Council Member Beecham clarified his position in support of the business
community.

Council Member Barton supported the TOT.

Mr. Benest noted he had met with Chamber Director, Jim Rebosio, and
several other members of the business community.

Council Member Kleinberg asked whether the TOT Task Force was involved
in these conversations.

Mr. Benest said he was uncertain whether the TOT Task Force was involved.

Council Member Kleinberg said she would like to have specific information to
discount the allegation that hotels were not contacted.

businesses were contacted as well as the local hotels.

Council Member Kleinberg asked whether the staff person contacted the
General Manager of the hotels to discuss the TOT increase.

Mr. Yeats said he was uncertain.
