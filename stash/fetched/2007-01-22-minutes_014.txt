Council Member Cordell questioned the incentive for a company to develop a
worst case scenario that encompassed a large number of residents versus a
small number.

Mr. Firth responded the County of Santa Clara reviewed the Risk
Management Plan (RMP) to determine whether it was complete and
appropriate.

Council Member Cordell questioned whether the County had found a worst
case scenario inaccurate.

Mr. Firth stated he was not aware of any inaccuracies.

Mr. Baum stated he was aware of an incident in another city in the County
where quality control was done by a regulatory authority which questioned
the assumptions that were entered into.

Council Member Morton clarified that the proposal would allow the Fire
Department to see the plans and allow the Council to respond to the County,
on behalf of the City, to the level of risk management

Mr. Firth stated that was correct, and the City would provide comments to
the County.

Council Member Morton clarified that passing the legislation gave Palo Alto
an opportunity to see whether the worst case scenario made sense.

Mr. Firth stated the Fire Department received copies of the worst case
scenarios for both businesses in Palo Alto.

Mayor Kishimoto questioned whether the Countyâ€™s approval process was
appealable.

Mr. Firth stated the County merely approved the adequacy of a RMP but did
not have the authority to reject it.

Mr. Larkin stated the County had the authority to reject the RMP but did not
have the authority to reject the application for the hazardous materials, if
the plan were compliant.

Mr. Williams stated there was no discretion for the Fire Marshal to deny the
permit if the criteria were met.

Mayor Kishimoto questioned whether it was possible for the City to require
that the right to know take place prior the issuance of the permit.
