STUDY SESSION

1.    Study Session with the Utilities Advisory Commission Regarding 1)
      Potential Expansion of the City's Fiber Optic Network and 2) Utilities
      Department and Utilities Advisory Commission Priorities for 2013 and
      Beyond.

Utilities Advisory Commission (UAC) Chair James Cook gave a brief overview
of the last joint study session which occurred in 2011. Chair Cook reminded
the audience that two particular issues were flagged in the last joint study
session: a carbon neutral goal for the electric utility and a second electric
transmission interconnection to Palo Alto. By way of quick update, Chair
Cook noted the recent success marked by the Council’s approval of the
implementation plan to achieve a carbon neutral electric supply, and Staff’s
current and on-going efforts with regard to a second electric transmission
interconnection. Council Members expressed support for re-visiting and
renewing efforts to develop a fiber-to-the-premise plan in the context of Palo
Alto being a “Connected City” and in the context of economic development.
Several members reiterated their strong interest in electric reliability for the
City through a second electric transmission interconnection. Other items of
interest raised by Council Members included cybersecurity, smart grid, and
programs to continue to fulfill climate protection plan objectives.
