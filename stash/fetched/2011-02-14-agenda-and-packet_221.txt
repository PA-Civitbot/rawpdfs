        Mandatory Findings of Significance        Less Than Significant Impact


The conclusion of the Initial Study is that there are no significant impacts associated with the
project, including tue reauction of four lanes ortraf:fictotwo lanes. Tue PTe's recommenQatlon
will be considered by the City Council on February 10,2010, at which time the Council will also
establish a Capital Improvements Program (CIP) for the project. Since the PTC is responsible
for conducting an annual review of CIPs affecting the physical develioment of the city for
consistency with the Compo Plan and potential improvements in economy efficiency, Staff is
recomnlending that the PTC review those factors now, as the CIP is being established.

Design Phase
If the environmental analysis is approved and the funding is provided, the project will proceed
into a more detailed design' phase in the spring of this year. The design phase will involve
multiple community meetings as well as hearings with the ARB, PTC and ultimately the City
Council. During the design phase, which is estimated to take approximately 12 months, specifics
will be considered for the types and locations of the various amenities (benches, markers, signs,
tables, artwork, bicycle racks, newsracks, trash receptacles, etc.) to be placed along the street, as
well as the final configuration of the roadway including parking design, bulb-outs, and crosswalk
enhanceinents. Details for the design of the plaza near the train station will also be reviewed.
Construction of the project is expected to begin in the spring of20l2.
