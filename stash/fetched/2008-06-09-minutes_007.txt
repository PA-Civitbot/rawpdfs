City Clerk Donna Grider stated she had received 62 protests on water and 60
protests on refuse.

Mayor Klein stated there were 19,916 water customers subject to the water
rate increase, meaning 9,959 protests would need to be received in order to
create a majority protest. The total number received was 62, which is not
higher than 50 percent. He further stated that there were 19,222 refuse
customers subject to the refuse rate increase, meaning that 9,612 protests
would need to be received in order to create a majority protest. The total
number received was 60, which is not higher than 50 percent. Therefore, the
increase could be approved with Agenda Item Number 6.
