MOTION: Council Member Kishimoto moved, seconded by Cordell, to adopt
all of the City Auditor’s recommendations of February 14, 2005.

operating an Environmental Service Center.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION: Council Member Beecham moved, seconded by
Council Member Cordell, to stop the project to consider an Environmental
Services Center in the Baylands.
