the new units.

Council Member Kishimoto asked whether staff had concerns of units not
selling.

Mr. Williams stated there was not a large concern although there was always
a potential.

MOTION: Council Member Kishimoto moved, seconded by Vice Mayor
Drekmeier to refer this item to the Policy and Services Committee for
review.

Council Member Schmid stated Council was looking for an alternative pricing
scheme between the CPI program and the median income. The use of
median income was based on ABAGâ€™s guidelines and target goals in the BMR
housing criteria. The original direction from Council was to substitute Area
Median Income (AMI) for CPI.

Council Member Yeh asked the number of potential units in within the year
and the terms of unit turnover.

Manager of Planning and Community Environment Cathy Siegel stated there

Council Member Kishimoto stated the agreed formula for the selling price of
the units was eighty percent of the AMI including depreciation.
