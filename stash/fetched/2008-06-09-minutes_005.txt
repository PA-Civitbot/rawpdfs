Council Member Kishimoto asked whether the interviewing would be for Ms.
Kirkeby’s position only.

Ms. Grider stated yes, the other recruitments had been completed and were
in position for appointment.

Council Member Kishimoto expressed concern over the four interviewed
applicants. She stated only one met the “professional artist” qualification.

Ms. Grider stated the recruitment process would follow the established
guidelines in the Municipal Code.

Council Member Kishimoto suggested recruitment be re-opened for the
previous four positions in line with Ms. Kirkeby’s.

Ms. Grider stated the process would take a number of weeks to complete
and there would be costs associated with the re-advertisement.

Council Member Kishimoto saw no other way since there was only one
qualified person out of the four who applied.

Council Member Schmid stated the Charter denoted the position be held by a
“professional artists or educator”. He asked why it would exclude “art
lovers”.

City Attorney Gary Baum clarified the information was in the Palo Alto
Municipal Code (PAMC) not the City Charter.

Council Member Morton stated the PAMC would be easier to change than the
City Charter.

Mr. Baum agreed.

Mayor Klein suggested all applicants be considered for the five open seats at
the end of the recruitment in order to choose the most qualified candidates.

Mr. Baum did not see an issue. He asked the City Clerk to validate the
process.

Ms. Grider stated the Council proceeded similarly in previous recruitments.
She noted when there were non-qualified candidates, the recruitment was
re-opened.

Council Member Yeh did not support the Motion.
