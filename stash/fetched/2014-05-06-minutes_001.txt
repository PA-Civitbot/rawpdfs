STUDY SESSION

1.    Fiscal Year 2015 Proposed Budget Overview.


James Keene, City Manager, submitted the City of Palo Alto's Fiscal Year (FY)
2015 Proposed Operating Budget in accordance with his responsibilities as
City Manager. The Citywide Expenditure Budget of $470.1 million had
increased by $11.6 million, or 2.5 percent, in comparison to the FY 2014
Adopted Budget of $458.5 million. The FY 2015 Proposed General Fund
Operating Expenditure Budget of $171.4 million had increased by $11.7
million, or 7.3 percent, in comparison to the FY 2014 Adopted Budget of
$159.7 million. Citywide the Proposed Budget included 1,036 Full-Time
Equivalent (FTE) benefited positions which increased by 17.45 positions. A
decade ago the City's total budgeted position count was almost 1,093 FTEs.
The Proposed Expenditure Budget was balanced with $169.4 million in
revenues and $2 million in contributions from the Budget Stabilization
Reserve (BSR). These contributions would represent a 1.3 percent reduction
from the BSR 18.5 percent target level in order to fund Council-directed
initiatives and some major one-time expenses. As part of the Proposed
Budget, the BSR would be set at 17.2 percent or $29.5 million. The $11.7
million increase in General Fund expenditures was mostly possible due to a
significant increase in major tax revenue estimates of $9.2 million. The
significant increases in tax revenues resulted from a more robust economy
and job growth, which in turn increased demand for parking, traffic-related
responses, infrastructure, and other City services.
