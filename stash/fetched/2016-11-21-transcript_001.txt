Study Session

1.    Study Session to Discuss the Planned Rebuilding Project of the Junior

Mayor Burt: Our first order of business tonight is a Study Session to discuss
â€¦

Female: Council Member Kniss is here.

Mayor Burt: In grand fashion.

Council Member Kniss: I knew you'd be delighted.

Mayor Burt: Our first item is a Study Session to discuss the planned
rebuilding project of the Junior Museum and Zoo. Mr. de Geus.

Rob de Geus, Community Services Director: Good evening, Mayor Burt,
Council Members. Rob de Geus, Director of Community Services, here.
We're pleased to provide an update on the rebuilding of the Junior Museum
and Zoo. We have a number of guests here this evening and people that are
going to help with the presentation. We have a special guest that I'd like to
introduce first. That's John Aiken, the Manager of the Junior Museum and
Zoo, and our bald eagle, Sequoia, who lives at the Junior Museum and Zoo.
John thought he might share a few things about Sequoia.

John Aiken, Community Services Manager: We thought it would be fun for
you guys to feel that little bit of inspiration that children feel every day when
they come to the Junior Museum and engage with animals and science
experiments and the fun things that we do. I've always been stunned by
raptors when I look at them. I think birds of prey are particularly intriguing
