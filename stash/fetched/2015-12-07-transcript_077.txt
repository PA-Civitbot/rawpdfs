Council Member Scharff: I'm good with that, if the Council wants to do it. I
don't have strong feelings one way or the other. If it's 55, I'll probably be
dead.

Council Member Filseth: I don't have terribly strong feelings either, but it
seems odd to have both.

Mayor Holman: Are you making an amendment?

Council Member Filseth: Sure, I'll propose a friendly amendment subject to
other people weighing in. Why don't we make them both 55?

Mayor Holman: Didn't we already in one of the other sections already do 55,
59 or was it just 55 in the other section? I think it was already previously
occurring. Can we ...

Ms. Silver: No, it's just in the density bonus section where we have that 55,
59 distinction. I think from an administrative standpoint it certainly is easier
to have the same number for both.

Mayor Holman: Council Member Scharff?

Council Member Scharff: I said yes.

Mayor Holman: Council Member Berman?

Council Member Berman: I'm just taking a quick look, sorry.             From an
administrative standpoint, I guess I'm okay with that. Yeah.

Mayor Holman: That's accepted. That's for a term of 55 years. For David,
this section ... There are a couple of places. It's Section 18.15.040, that's
55 years, which that's right. In Section 18.15.100, it changes under (d)(iv),
59 to 55. Agreed Council Member Filseth? Is there any place else? I think
that's it. The City Attorney's occupied. It seems to be just that one place,
and we'll have the City Attorney weigh in. Where's the other place, Council
Member Filseth?

Council Member Filseth: I see two places. One is—I take it back. Maybe
there's only one.
