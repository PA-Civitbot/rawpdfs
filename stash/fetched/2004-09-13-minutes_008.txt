Council Member Ojakian said there were laws restricting the activity of the
Council.

Mr. Baum said the law restricted advocacy by the City or the City Council.

Council Member Ojakian asked about the catch basins around Lincoln
Avenue.

Mr. Roberts said all of the new storm drains and lines would include inlets,
catch basins, and additional drainage capacity.

Council Member Ojakian said it would be difficult to pass the legislation.

Council Member Kleinberg asked about the General Fund’s $800,000 direct
subsidy to the Storm Drainage Fund, which would be eliminated.

Director of Administrative Services Carl Yeats said the money would be
returned to the General Fund.      The $800,000 was transferred out of
operations in the General Fund each year to support the Storm Drain Fund.
Therefore, the money would not transfer.

City Manager Frank Benest said the funds could be used for other needed
operational or infrastructure capital improvements.

Council Member Kleinberg asked about the opportunity cost for prepayment.

Mr. Yeats said if there was a prepayment, an amount of money in interest
would be lost if a loan were created for the Storm Drain Fund. The City
would not pay the inflationary growth in the storm drain rate over the 12
years because there would be a lump sum payment. The General Fund’s
reserves would be drawn down, and the City would lose what would have
been earned.

Council Member Kleinberg asked for the financial bottom line.

Mr. Yeats said the Budget Stabilization Reserve would be brought below the
18.5 percent level. Surplus funds from operations would go back into the
Stabilization Reserve.

Council Member Kleinberg said it was time to move forward, make the
environment safer, and protect community property.

Council Member Freeman said the fee charged would begin at $10 and climb
to $14.26 over the 12 years. She asked about the sunset clause.
