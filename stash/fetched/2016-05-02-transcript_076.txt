INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to replace in the Motion Part A, “an evaluation”
with “a preliminary evaluation.”

MOTION PARTS A AND C RESTATED:                    Council Member DuBois moved,
seconded by Council Member Holman to:

A.         Direct Staff to return to Council with a preliminary evaluation of an
           Eichler overlay or strengthening the Individual Review (IR) Guidelines
           to incorporate Eichler design and privacy compatibility where
           appropriate, and depending on the context of the lot, make allowance
           for:

     iv.         Second stories; and

     v.          Adjustments to setbacks; and

     vi.         Possibly other accommodations; and

C.         Direct Staff to return to Council with options regarding the petition and
           voting process for SSOs and overlays

Mayor Burt: On this Motion, we have a second Motion that we'll have on the
interim. We're just voting on what's on the screen. That passes 7-0 with
Council Members Schmid and Wolbach recused.

MOTION PARTS A AND C AS AMENDED PASSED: 7-0 Schmid, Wolbach
not participating

Mayor Burt:        Now, we will go to the second Motion regarding an interim
ordinance.

MOTION PART B RESTATED:                Council Member DuBois moved, seconded
by Council Member Holman to:

B.         Adopt an interim Ordinance establishing a Single Story Overlay District
           (SSO) for one year to return for potential renewal if the Eichler overlay
           discussion is not completed.

Mayor Burt: For those who have not spoken on this, Council Member
Holman. Wait.

Mr. Keene: (inaudible) think Molly would say that you would strike the word
interim from it. It's just an ordinance establishing it for 1 year, not an
interim ordinance.
