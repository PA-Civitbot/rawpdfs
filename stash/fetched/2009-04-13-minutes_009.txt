Mr. Williams stated the P&TC discussed this inquiry and concluded that
through an agreement with the City, the City would allow an occupant to
check-in and check-out. He indicated this voluntary action from the hotel
and hotel guest would satisfy the TOT requirements.

Council Member Burt inquired if a system was in place to collect TOT on
residential condos that were privately owned and rented by hotel
management companies.

Mr. Williams stated there was a system in place to collect TOT on privately
owned condos that were rented through hotel management companies.

Council Member Burt inquired whether owners of condos would be required
to pay the TOT if they did not rent their condos through hotel management
companies.

Mr. Williams stated condo owners legally had an obligation to pay the TOT.

Council Member Burt inquired on the City’s administration practices in these
circumstances.

Mr. Perez stated Staff was currently not monitoring or enforcing these
activities.

Council Member Burt stated monitoring and enforcement mechanisms should
be studied.

Council Member Schmid inquired where the hotel overlays were on the
Research, Office and Limited Manufacturing District (ROLM), Research Park
District (RP), and the General Manufacturing District (GM) zones.

Mr. Williams stated there were presently no hotel overlays in those areas;
however, approval of this Staff report would create an opportunity for an
applicant to create a hotel overlay in the ROLM district, RP district, and the
GM zone pursuant to regulations.

Council Member Schmid inquired whether the hotel overlays would apply to
specific parcels, or parcels that possessed subsequent zoning decisions
previously approved.

Mr. Williams stated both situations were correct.

Council Member Schmid inquired on the zoning designation of Ming’s
Restaurant site.
