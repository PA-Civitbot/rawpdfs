COUNCIL COMMENTS, QUESTIONS, AND ANNOUNCEMENTS

Council Member Kishimoto stated the prior week both she and Vice Mayor
Burch had met with four residents of Downtown North. They made it clear
they were not meeting as a mandate from the Council but as two Council
Members seeking a common ground. It was an administrative issue and not
quasi-legislative and they would keep their minds open to any new
information.

Vice Mayor Burch said it was a good meeting with spirit and it was beneficial
to meet with residents on both sides of the issue to listen and reflect.

Vice Mayor Burch stated Councilmember Kleinberg reported the Santa Clara
Counties Cities Selection Committee reappointed Palo Alto resident Ann Mack
to the Advisory Committee of the Santa Clara County Council on Aging.

Mayor Beecham appointed the former CAO Committee members to the Ad
Hoc Attorney Search Committee: Councilmembers Kleinberg, Mossar, and
Ojakian, with Council Member Kleinberg as Chair of the Committee.

ADJOURNMENT: The meeting adjourned at 11:05 p.m.
