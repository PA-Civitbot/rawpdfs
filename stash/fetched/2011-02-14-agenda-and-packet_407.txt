                 Table 4: Summary of cost estimates to for multiple hearth incinerators to achieve beyond-the-floor reductions of mercury after
                 implementation of a national dental amalgam program. Based on Palo Altoâ€™s dental amalgam results EPA can assume a 60 percent
                 reduction in the amount of mercury entering the wastewater treatment plants.
