to allocations for new projects each year plus funds needed for the Cityâ€™s
basic maintenance not on the list.

Mr. Benest stated the original Council policy clearly stated existing General
Fund revenues were not to be used for new infrastructure or City work
projects. That policy is no longer in place.

opportunity to bring together the aspects of financial and residential
possibilities for creating this new community.
