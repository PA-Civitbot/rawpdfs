from the project applicants and a summary of the Planning and
Transportation Commission study session on this same topic from Chair
Karen Holman. The Council expressed general support for the Village
Concept study, but that it needed to be balanced with fiscal decisions that
will provide financial benefits to the City. The design of the Village Concept
should be compatible with the community. Housing in appropriate areas
near the project sites would enhance the Village Concept.
Council took a break from 9:02 p.m. returning at 9: 09 p.m.
