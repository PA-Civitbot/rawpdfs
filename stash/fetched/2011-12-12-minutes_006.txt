ACTION ITEMS

14.   Consideration of an Acquisition Loan in the Amount of $1.29 Million
      with Palo Alto Housing Corporation for the Purchase of 2811-2825
      Alma St.

Steven Turner, Advanced Planning Manager, stated Staff recommended, at
the request of the Palo Alto Housing Corporation, that Council approve a
loan in the amount of $1.29 million from the Cities Commercial Housing
Fund. This loan would be for the acquisition and closing costs of two parcels
at 2811-2825 Alma Street. These parcels would be rehabilitated and rented
out at below market rates. This loan would be consistent with the purpose
of the Housing Fund and language in the Housing Element. This would be a
second loan to the Opportunity Fund Loan; the total of the two loans would
be $1.79 million which was the accepted offer by the owner of the parcels.
The terms of the loan were consistent with similar past projects.

Candace Gonzales, Executive Director of Palo Alto Housing Corporation
(PAHC), expressed appreciation for the City Council's consideration of their
request. She indicated the City was a critical partner to their developments.
