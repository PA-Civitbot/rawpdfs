INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER:

1.   To direct the Applicant to bring the project back to the Historic
     Resources Board to analyze the following issues:

A.   The Preservation Architecture report focuses on whether there are
     criteria for a historic district. There is no need for existence of a
     district for there to be historic considerations.    The HRB should
     determine whether there are other factors that should be considered;
     and

B.   What is the applicable “area of potential effect” under (California
     Environmental Quality Act) CEQA analysis?; and

C.   There are a number of historic structures near (e.g. on Kipling Street),
     one next to the proposed project and several across the street. How
     will the project impact these structures?; and

                                                                          Page 6 of 11
