Mayor Scharff: Where is that?

Council Member DuBois: In Section 5, the first paragraph where it says
18.42.140, inventory sites. The first sentence, it shall apply to the sites
listed in the 2015-2025 Housing Element housing inventory. That's to make
it specific.

Mayor Scharff: That's fine.

Council Member Fine: Yeah.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to add to the Motion, “Section 5 add ‘2015-2023’
after ‘sites listed in the.’” (New Part A.ii.)

Council Member DuBois: Thank you. The last one is on Page 329, Section
11 I (1). I would propose that we change it from 100 new net trips to 50
net new trips.

Council Member Fine: I don't think I'm going to accept that yet, but I do
have a question to Staff. How did you come up with the 100?

Ms. Gitelman: The 100 was derived from the VTA guidelines we use to
determine when a quantitative traffic analysis is needed for a development
project.

Council Member Fine: Thank you. I'm not ready to accept that one yet.

Council Member Holman: Second.

AMENDMENT:         Council Member DuBois moved, seconded by Council
Member Holman to add to the Motion, “replace in Section 12(d)(1)(b), ‘100’
with ‘50.’” (New Part A.iii.)

Mayor Scharff: We have a second. Speak to your Motion.

Council Member DuBois: I am open to a different number. I don't think I've
ever seen a project come to us that generated 100 net new trips. It just
seems like something that won't occur. I think we're interested in TDM
programs, so I think maybe some lower number. I just picked 50, but I'd be
open to a different number.

Mayor Scharff: You seconded?

Council Member Holman: Yeah. Fifty is as good a number as anything else.
I'm supportive of that and agree with your concept.
