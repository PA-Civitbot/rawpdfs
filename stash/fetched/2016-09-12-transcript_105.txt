designations could be, and sometimes they could be more important than
what's on the existing project. You could think of a nonconforming use. We
should have to be, in my view, compatible with a nonconforming use.

Mayor Burt: Eric, are you saying you want to replace adjacent land uses?

Council Member Filseth: No, no, no, no, no. No, no. If you go back to ...

Mayor Burt: You want to remove ...

Council Member Filseth: If you go back to Page 312 ...

Mayor Burt: It's not saying "or land use designations." It's saying "and."

Council Member Filseth: "And land use designations."

Mayor Burt: It's now requiring both things, and you want to take one away.

Council Member Filseth: If you go back to Page 312, it says adjacent land
uses and land use designations. The Council struck out "and land use
designations."

Mayor Burt: I see.

Council Member Filseth: It's got back in the Motion.

Mayor Burt: I see what you're saying there. Now that I think about it, I'm
not sure why we want to get rid of an "and." If it was "or," I'd get it.

Council Member Filseth: (crosstalk)

Mayor Burt: It's now got to meet both of those. You want to water it down.

Council Member Filseth: I think you might be right actually.

Mayor Burt: I might.

Council Member Filseth:     You're right.   As long as it's "and," it's probably
okay.

AMENDMENT TO THE AMENDMENT: Council Member Filseth moved,
seconded by Council Member XX to add to the Amendment, “remove from
Finding Number 2(d), ‘and land use designations.’”

AMENDMENT TO THE AMENDMENT WITHDRAWN BY THE MAKER
