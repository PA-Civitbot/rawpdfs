Ms. Antil said the original bid document was not with Staff but they were
researching to locate a date.

AMENDMENT: Council Member Klein moved, seconded by Council Member
Scharff that the appropriate transition period is not to extend any later than
February 1, 2012.

Council Member Klein felt it was poor management to have an incumbent
remain for a long period of time and did not see a positive gain from an
extensive extension. He said if a group was to contribute funds to
supplement the income of the crossing guards, it was completely
independent of the contract in process.

Council Member Scharff felt an outside end date was important for a smooth
transition.

Council Member Schmid stated there was a business model included in the
RFQ which was what vendors were bidding on, to not have a fixed date the
business model deteriorated. He felt the fixed date of February 1, 2012
made a clean conclusion for the situation.

Mayor Espinosa supported the Amendment and encouraged creative thinking
from organization and felt 3-months was a significant amount of time.

Ms. Antil informed Council the bid documents were good up to 60-days after
bid opening and Staff had previously extended it which took the process
through December.

Mayor Espinosa asked for clarification on the exact date it was extended to.

Ms. Antil confirmed it was to the end of December and the vendor, AGS, had
indicated they were willing to extend to the end of January 2012.

AMENDMENT PASSED: 8-1 Yeh no
Council Member Scharff understood the contract was being awarded to AGS
tonight.

Mr. Keene confirmed that was correct.

Council Member Scharff asked if Staff had the discretion between now and
January 31, 2012 to alter the transition date from February 1, 2012
depending on the transition.
