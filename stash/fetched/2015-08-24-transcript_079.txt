Ms. Silver: Why don't you make a motion? That would be fine.

Mayor Holman: I'll make a motion that the Staff bring back Chapter 18.79,
Development Project Preliminary Review Procedures, at a subsequent
Council meeting for Council consideration.

Mr. Keene: Thank you. I'm not intimately familiar with what that does.
Just so we don't send any confusing messages to the public, this is really not
related to PCs.

Mayor Holman: That's correct.

Mr. Keene: This would be procedures as they apply to other zoning or land
use decisions.

Mayor Holman: This is a much broader consideration.

Mr. Keene: Pardon me?

Mayor Holman: This is a much broader consideration. Can I get a second to
the motion?

Vice Mayor Schmid: Second.

Mayor Holman: Thank you, Vice Mayor Schmid.

MOTION: Mayor Holman moved, seconded by Vice Mayor Schmid to direct
Staff to bring back changes to Municipal Code Section 18.79, Development
Project Preliminary Review Procedures at a subsequent Council meeting.

Mayor Holman: If there are no questions ...

Council Member Kniss: I have a question. Why don't I just get it out now?
In our packet for tonight is a long list of PCs, but it ends at the end of 2012.
Have we done one since the end of 2012 that I've simply forgotten? If you
look at packet page 4 ...

Mr. Keene: Was it 101 Alma, the last one that we did? I mean 101 Lytton.

Mayor Holman: Yes, yes.

Mr. Keene: SurveyMonkey building.

Vice Mayor Schmid: College Terrace ...

Council Member Kniss: Yeah. That's before I was here.
