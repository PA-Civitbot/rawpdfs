The winds are indeed blowing very hard, my friends, but I believe Palo Alto has strong

roots. Our namesake El Palo Alto was first spotted on the horizon of the 18th century—

who could have imagined then the dynamic 21st century city that flourishes here today?




Our roots are deep and strong for many reasons.

   •   First, we are an international community. The number of languages spoken

       every day here rivals any American city and the presence of people from many

       countries adds immeasurably to the vibrancy of our community life.

   •   Second, we are a community of neighborhoods. Each part of our city has its own

       distinctive character and contributes to a greater whole.

   •   Third, we are a community that is passionate about education, literacy and

       lifelong learning. We take great pride in the quality of our schools, our libraries,

       and our proximity to Stanford, one of the world’s leading research universities.

   •   We also are passionate about the unique characteristics we cherish about our

       city—and like HanaHaus, we continuously look for ways to retain what is

       distinctive while connecting our treasured heritage with the world we live in today.

Our roots grow in fertile ground that has produced an abundant harvest of innovation—

from the days when David Packard and William Hewlett pioneered an industry in their

Palo Alto garage, to a startup culture where fresh ideas are re-seeded by each new

generation.
