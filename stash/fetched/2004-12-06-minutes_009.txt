Director of Public Works Glenn Roberts asked Council to provide staff
direction to initiate a zone change and the ability to continue further design
work.

George Browning, Sutherland Drive, said reconstruction of the Police building
was needed.

Jean Wilcox, 4005 Sutherland Drive, suggested the current Council
Chambers be used for the additional space needed by the Police Department
and a new Council Chambers be built at the Downtown Library site.

Herb Borock, P.O. Box 632, suggested narrowing Forest Avenue and
expanding 40 feet onto the Forest Avenue side of the building.

Joy Ogawa said the option of a new Police building at the Alma substation
site at 841 Alma Street should be explored.

Elaine Meyer, 609 Kingsley Avenue, said the City should not build over the
50-foot height limit restriction.

Mike Shealy, 70 Waverley Oaks, said a facility should not stand in the way of
the development of the Police force.

Council Member Kleinberg asked staff about the sites that had been
considered.

Mr. Roberts said because the Police Department and the Council Chambers
were physically interconnected, the Council Chambers had been listed as a
remodel.

Council Member Kleinberg asked how long the Council would be displaced.

Mr. Roberts said additional conceptual engineering needed to be completed
to answer that question.

Ms. Johnson said at the inception, the Council did not want the Police
building to be in a residential area.

Council Member Kleinberg asked about the Alma substation site.

Mr. Roberts said staff had preliminary analysis of the Alma substation site.
The size of the site was too small, did not have parking and had limited
access.
