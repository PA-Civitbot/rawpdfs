Mayor Mossar said that sometimes tradition worked.

Council Member Freeman asked for clarification of a recruitment process for
the Architectural Review Board (ARB) at the same time each year.

City Clerk Donna Rogers said the recruitment for the ARB was done at the
same time each year.

Council Member Freeman said historically it had been the same time frame.
She was concerned the group of candidates that followed the procedures
was expecting to be interviewed, and now the procedure had changed.
There was a viable option of candidates to choose from presently.

Mayor Mossar said her comments were a clarification of how the Council had
handled that situation in the past. The Council would choose in its discussion
what it would do.

Vice Mayor Beecham noted the original motion was on the table to continue
the item.

Council Member Morton asked the City Attorney whether the applicants
could be included in the pool automatically unless they chose to withdraw.

Ms. Furth said the process of starting over was an appropriate one. She
suggested the candidate applications be resubmitted.

Council Member Kleinberg restated her substitute motion to reopen the
recruitment for the ARB candidacy.

Council Member Beecham asked whether the applications could be carried
over.

Council Member Lytle said the applications should be carried over if it is
legal.

Ms. Furth gave a recommendation for the process of reopening the
application process.

Council Member Kleinberg said that she would add the recommended
process to her motion.

SUBSTITUTE TO SUBSTITUTE MOTION: Council Member Kleinberg
moved, seconded by Ojakian, to reject the applications, reopen the filing
period, and notify the four remaining applicants that their applications would
be deemed reinstated for the new filing period unless the Clerkâ€™s Office is
instructed otherwise.
