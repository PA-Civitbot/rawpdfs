proposed a ballot measure; however, the San Mateo County approach was
better.

Roland Lebrun noted the study considered a two-track system only. A four-
track system would have fewer impacts. BART was not a good option
compared to Caltrain.

Council Member Klein asked if the previous study indicated a cost of $600
million.

Mr. Canepa replied yes.

Council Member Klein inquired about the components of the $600 million
amount.

Mr. Canepa indicated that study was performed in conjunction with HSR. It
studied a difference between what HSR would do and the additional
trenching. It did not cover items such as shooflies and utilities.

Council Member Klein noted the cost of a 2-percent grade alternative was
less than $600 million, and requested Mr. Canepa explain the difference.

Mr. Canepa reported the HSR study considered a trench from end to end of
the City.

Council Member Klein inquired whether the $500 million cost covered
trenching of slightly more than half the City.

Mr. Canepa explained that a 2-percent grade alternative would trench
approximately 1.8 miles.

Council Member Klein asked if the total distance between Menlo Park and
Mountain View was 4 miles.

Mr. Canepa advised that the distance was in that range.

Council Member Klein asked if the range of costs remained at $200-$300
million per mile.

Mr. Canepa responded yes. The design was still conceptual.

Council Member Klein asked if the current study provided more details, but
indicated roughly the same cost.

Mr. Canepa replied yes. The current study covered different details.
