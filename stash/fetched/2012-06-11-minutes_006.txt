Public Safety. Part of the $5.8 million gap was a $2 million increase for
Retiree Medical.      The General Fund Budget had been reduced by
approximately 10 percent. Sixty positions were removed from the Budget
prior to FY 2013, and 10.5 Full-Time Equivalents (FTE) were removed in the
Proposed Budget for FY 2013, not including 14 positions proposed to be
frozen. Freezing a position meant Staff wanted to retain the FTE in the
Table of Organization, but defunding the Budget itself. Staff had made
adjustments for the lack of these positions in the delivery of services.
Revenue increases were slight, and resulted from increased sales, hotel, and
property taxes. Net changes in the Operating Budget totaled approximately
$1 million.    The FC directed Staff to add $2.2 million for additional
infrastructure funding, as a result of the Infrastructure Blue Ribbon
Commission (IBRC) recommendations. Concessions from the Public Safety
Department resulted in a savings of approximately $1.5 million, primarily
from the Police Officers' Association. The Proposed Budget as presented on
April 30, 2012, contained two one-time items for a Development Center
Capital Improvement Program (CIP) of approximately $800,000 and an
Airport loan of $310,000. Staff recommended drawing on Reserves for
those two specific projects, which would balance the Budget. That was not
the standard practice, and Staff did not want to become accustomed to
drawing on Reserves; however, because of the one-time nature of the items
and the prior year's transfer of $4 million to Reserves, Staff felt it should be
considered. Since April 30, 2012, the Proposed Budget had been amended
to increase expenditures by $90,000, lower fee increase recommendations,
and add charges recommended by Staff to the FC. With these changes, the
Budget gap decreased to $1.112 million. In reconciling the Budget prior to
the final FC meeting, Staff found a few changes totaling $722,000. In
reinstating Animal Services to the Budget, Staff failed to net out the
$500,000 place holder for contract services. Staff had moved Retiree
Medical charges for Animal Services to another Department. That place
holder could now be removed. With those changes, the Budget gap was
reduced to $390,000. Staff recommended the Council use the Budget
Stabilization Reserve (BSR) to close the gap. Staff believed the majority of
the $310,000 loan for the Airport provided justification for the draw. Staff
projected a BSR balance of $27.4 million or 18 percent of the Operating
Budget. Staff projected a $2.3 million draw on the BSR for FY 2012;
however, this would not be necessary after Staff compared actual figures
with projections. Staff projected a BSR balance of approximately $29.7
million or 19.4 percent of expenditures.

Pam Antil, Assistant City Manager, explained the proposed changes to the
Fire Department. Earlier in the year, Station 7 closed as part of the
agreement with Stanford, which resulted in a reduction of 9 FTEs. Staff
