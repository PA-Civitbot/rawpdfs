organization acquire the Palo Alto Junior Museum and Zoo.

Adela Morris, 1755 La Honda, Woodside, requested the public be kept
informed on the status of the project.

John Walton, 310 Leland Avenue, supported collaboration with a non-profit
organization.

Ron Lee, 922 Celia, said the museum should maintain professional staffing.

Courtenay C. Corrigan, 13441 Roldeda Road, Los Altos Hills, said the facility
was in a dilapidated state.

Aletha Coleman, 296 Bay Road, Atherton, said she wanted a commitment
from the Friends of the Palo Alto Museum and Zoo.

collaboration with a non-profit organization.

Herb Borock, P.O. Box 432, said the Council needed to consider whether the
Policy & Services (P&S) Committee should continue to operate as a
committee.

Council Member Beecham requested staff to speak on the impact of the work
plan.

Assistant City Manager Emily Harrison spoke for the Community Services
Director; retirements had caused a delay in the golf course management
study.

Council Member Beecham asked how long of a delay.

Ms. Harrison said the delay would be a six-month period but would include
details on labor, liability and management issues.

Council Member Beecham said it was not the intent to delay.

Council Member Drekmeier supported having a non-profit organization take
a substantial role.

Council Member Cordell said she was concerned about staff layoffs with a
non-profit organization taking over. She recommended a public/private
partnership vote be taken at the next P&S meeting.
