think, first speaker about the airplane noise. I've been very vocal, written,
phone calls, etc. I thank Joe Simitian and Anna Eshoo for their efforts trying
to do something about the continued airplane noise. Between 6:00 in the
morning and 1:00 a.m. the next morning, airplanes are flying low over our
homes in the Barron Park neighborhood, where I live, and I know in many
other neighborhoods, frankly, at midnight when I'm nice and warm and don't
want to jump out of bed and make phone calls to complain to the noise
abatement or at 6:00 in the morning when I'd like to spend another half an
hour sleeping. Some of those times, the planes seem to be at their loudest.
Mostly during the day, there are almost no times when it's quiet overhead.
Anything that the City Council can do to help mitigate that would be most
appreciated by all of us. Thank you and congratulations. Thank you for
your efforts and your time.

Mayor Burt: Thank you. On that note, our meeting is adjourned. We'd like
to invite everyone to the lobby to join us for refreshments.

Adjournment: The meeting was adjourned at 7:36 P.M.
