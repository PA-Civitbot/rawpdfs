Council Member Kleinberg said it was not excluded and asked when the
issue went to Policy and Services (P&S) to ensure there is not a loophole
where a candidate could inadvertently be in violation.

13.   Response to Council’s Questions Regarding the City’s Acquisition
      of a Permanent Easement at El Camino Park for the Emergency

University.

Vice Mayor Klein stated he would not participate in Consent Item No. 13
due to a conflict of interest because his wife was employed by Stanford
University.

Council Member Mossar stated she would not participate in Item No. 13
due to a conflict of interest because her husband was employed by
Stanford University.

Mayor Kishimoto said the item pertained to questions regarding El
Camino Park as the emergency water supply and storage and would not
require an action. The response was in regard to Council questions and
she appreciated the research and clarification. The research was helpful
and future steps were clarified. It was her understanding the item
would be an advisory vote on the November 2007 ballot.
