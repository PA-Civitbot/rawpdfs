                             MINUTES

Stephanie Munoz remarked that the residents of Buena Vista Mobile Home
Park, not the owners, voted to be annexed into Palo Alto. The Council was
considering evicting those same residents. The Council should rezone the
property as trailer park. Failing that, the Council should condemn and buy
the property for low-income housing.

Blanca Fonseca asked the Council to remember Buena Vista Mobile Home
Park. More than 100 families would be affected by the closing of Buena
Vista. Hearings to decide the future of Buena Vista were scheduled for May
12-14, 2014. The public was invited to attend a rally in support of Buena
Vista residents on May 12, 2014.

Council Member Holman inquired about the time and location of the
hearings.

James Keene, City Manager, would provide information to the Council and
advertise information.

Ms. Fonseca indicated the hearings would be held at 450 Avenidas Senior
Center on May 12-14, 2014, from 6:30 P.M. to 9:30 P.M.

CONSENT CALENDAR

Flora Dong spoke regarding Agenda Item number 5. A second-story window
at the home proposed for 1737 University Avenue looked into her kitchen.
She had requested the owner and/or architect locate the window parallel
with the street or frost the window. The owner or architect rejected frosting
the window. The window affected her family's privacy dramatically, while
frosting the window would not affect the owner. She asked the Council to
remove the item from the Consent Calendar.
