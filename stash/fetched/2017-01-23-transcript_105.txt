Council Member Filseth: I second that one too.

AMENDMENT:        Council Member DuBois moved, seconded by Council
Member Filseth to add to the Motion, “direct Staff to propose a limit to daily
hangtags per employer.” (New Part C)

Council Member Filseth: Can I ask the maker of the Motion, you said
eliminate unlimited daily hangtags. I think we need a limit for the Motion.

Council Member DuBois:      Yes.  I didn't want to propose a number.
Households are limited to how many they can purchase. Maybe we limit the
number a business can purchase.

Council Member Filseth: How do we resolve the number?

Council Member DuBois: Have Staff come back with a proposal or we pick a
number tonight. Does Staff have a suggestion.

Mr. Keene: We're scurrying.

Mayor Scharff: Why don't you just suggest that Staff—just pass that Staff
come back.

Council Member DuBois: Residents can purchase 50 a year, right?

Ms. Gitelman: That's right. Each residence can purchase 50 a year. There's
not really a good way to equate that to employees.

Council Member DuBois: If an employer could purchase 50 per year …

Mr. Keene: I'd rather you guys vote on this. If it passes, you would direct
us to come back. Just let us give a little more thought to it. I understand
what the objective is.

Council Member DuBois: The Motion would be to have Staff propose a limit
per employer for daily hangtags.

Mayor Scharff: That's passes on a 6-2 vote.

AMENDMENT PASSED: 6-2 Scharff, Tanaka no, Kniss absent

Mayor Scharff: Are you done?

Council Member DuBois: Yes.

Mayor Scharff: Council Member Wolbach.
