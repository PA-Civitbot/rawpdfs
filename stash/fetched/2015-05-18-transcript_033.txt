Council Member Filseth: Do I understand correctly that we just voted to do
the brushed aluminum podium for the police station side but not the City
Hall side?

Mayor Holman: No. What happened was we voted to do the brushed
aluminum sign on the police side. On the City Hall side, we voted to do it
but attach it to the building.

Mr. Keene: As a straight line across.

Council Member Filseth:      On the other hand, that's the way it is on the
library as well. Right?

Mr. Keene: That's correct.

Mayor Holman: I did not understand it's a straight line across. It was just
attached to the building.

Mr. Keene: I thought we were cutting the podium part off, and we were just
putting it straight.

Mayor Holman: Staff needs to know what the direction is.

Mr. Keene: Rather than a "U," it's a straight line across with "City Hall" on
it.

Mr. Eggleston: I believe as original designed and proposed, it was a metal
tube. It would be mounted to the building with the letters mounted to that.

Mayor Holman: Council Member Burt, as the amender of the Motion, is that
what you intended?

Council Member Burt: Sounds good to me.

Mayor Holman: Okay. We'll go with that.

Mr. Keene: Before you move on, if you wouldn't mind approving the
contract itself so we can do the rest of it. It would be in order that you
would approve the recommendations with these modifications.

Council Member DuBois: I think that was at the top of the Motion.

Mr. Keene: It was?

Council Member DuBois: Yeah. Approve the contract. Because it got split
into three, I don't know if we need that.
