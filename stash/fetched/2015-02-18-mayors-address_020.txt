So there are some additional Council initiatives coming this year:

Slide

Strengthening neighborhoods

Slide         Green Meadow




This is Green Meadow, a National Register neighborhood, it so happens.

To further support strong neighborhood participation in civic affairs, several actions are
being proposed to better integrate the understanding, consideration and actions of our
City government with neighborhoods’ interests and concerns.

The City has made great strides in making information available including the very
informative Development Services Construction Updates and the Open Data Portal, for
instance, which have enhanced City outreach and communication with citizens and
neighborhoods.

This new initiative seeks to build on those accomplishments with additional focus on
communication with neighborhoods including holding annual town hall-style meetings
with City Council representatives and appropriate City staff and focused on different
regions of Palo Alto and each neighborhood being encouraged to identify a designated
“Communications Officer” as information liaison with the City.
This initiative is anticipated at Council in early March.
