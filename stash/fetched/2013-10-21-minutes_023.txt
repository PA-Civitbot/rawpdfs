Mayor Scharff felt it was important to eliminate out-of-date ordinances. The
Council wanted to move toward projects fully parking themselves, a robust
TDM program, an RPP Program and a parking garage. Holistically, those
were the components of a resolution for the parking issue. With respect to
grandfathering projects, last year the Council did not grandfather in the two
projects. It would be unfair for the Council to treat pipeline projects in 2013
differently than it treated pipeline projects in 2012. It became a money
issue in terms of paying in-lieu parking fees as opposed to redesigning the
project.

Council Member Burt recalled in July 2012 the Council gave a general notice
of intention to change regulations. In March 2013 the Council provided
additional direction. He was interested in why colleagues would not second
the Motion.

Council Member Kniss inquired whether the project at 240 Hamilton Avenue
was on appeal.

Mr. Aknin responded yes.

Council Member Kniss noted the Council would discuss several items related
to parking. The amendments along with an RPP Program and a TDM
Program should be considered together. The five pipeline projects would
pay a total of $300,000 for in-lieu parking fees.
