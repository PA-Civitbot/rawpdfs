                         TRANSCRIPT
the course of the budget planning work that we expect to undertake over
the summer and fall, developing implementation plans for the Sustainability
and Climate Action Plan, we anticipate there will be needs for additional
analysis and other work to be done that can't be defined until we begin that
work. We've been requesting that you allocate a contingency fund subject
to coming back to you for specific projects for your approval, but have the
money reserved at that time. That's the main reason for that. The
anticipated allocation was described in the budget request about 40 percent
for additional research and analysis to refine the Climate Plan
implementation scenarios, about 40 percent for a variety of anticipated pilot
projects and grant administration around the areas of mobility as a service,
zero net energy, electric vehicle development, and about 20 percent for
materials related to community engagement around further development
and engagement around the Plan. Those were estimated amounts at
$250,000. If you choose to reduce those in half, we would scale each of
those back perhaps proportionally. I think some things would fall away,
such as the digital commenter management which we don't have Staff
capacity to do in the absence of this support.

Mayor Burt: Thank you. Did Staff have any other follow-ups to Council
Member Holman's questions?

Ms. Nose: Yes. I think we'll actually ask Walter to come up and help us
answer questions regarding the tree trimming cycles.

Walter Passmore, Urban Forester: Good evening. Walter Passmore, Urban
Forester. The difference between the 10-year cycle recommended in your
budget proposal and the 7-year cycle that we are currently utilizing. For
Year 1, the 10-year cycle amounts to $1,148,885; whereas, the 7-year cycle
would be $1,465,785; about a $300,000 difference between a 10 and a 7.
Those costs escalate slightly for Years 2 and 3 of the contract. In total over
the 3-year term, the 10-year cycle would cost $3,680,960; the 7-year cycle
would be $4,702,450. It's a little over $1 million difference between a 10
and a 7 over the 3-year term.

Council Member Holman: What I'm trying to understand here isâ€”let's
compare apples to apples here. Going from a 15-year to a 10-year is
$170,000 in this next year's budget. What would be going from a 10 to a 7
in this next year's budget?

Mr. Passmore: It's about $300,000. It's not ...

Council Member Holman: Why?
