Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) properties, reviewing the
age and insurance costs.

Council Member Freeman said the calculations had some complexity to
them. It would help the Council to see what those numbers were in
examples and for the public to see what impacts it had on them. She
believed it would also be helpful to have information on the number of
homes that fell into the various percentages being proposed.

Council Member Mossar called for Point of Order.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION FAILED 3-5, Cordell, Freeman, Morton “yes,”
Kleinberg absent.

Council Member Ojakian asked whether there was a timeline on moving
forward with the proposed ordinance.

Mr. Roberts said the City was overdue on its next FEMA audit.

Council Member Ojakian expressed support for the motion. He believed it
would behoove staff to include an informational report when the item
returned for second reading to clarify some of the issues that had been
raised.

Council Member Kishimoto expressed support for the motion. Safety was the
number one issue. As seen from the last flood, there were a number of
residential and commercial structures at risk.

Council Member Morton said the proposed ordinance was not about the
importance of flood insurance but about triggering mandated improvements.
He expressed opposition to the motion.

Council Member Freeman said she believed safety was a big issue, but her
question had more to do with finances.

MOTION PASSED 5-3, Cordell, Freeman, Morton, “no,” Kleinberg absent.
