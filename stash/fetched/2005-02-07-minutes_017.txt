Council Member Ojakian referenced page 9.3 of the Report, under General
Fund Reserve, he noted the dollar amount increase and asked what the cap
was.

Mr. Benest said Council policy was to maintain a reserve between 15 and 20
percent. The key indicator was at 18 Â½ percent, which was a good place to
be, and it had been maintained at that percent even through very difficult
times.

Council Member Ojakian said he raised a question regarding the number of
computer workstations and asked if 978 new workstations had been
purchased.

Ms. Erickson said it was a total of workstations. Some employees did not
have workstations five years prior and had now been provided with one.
She added there were still a great number of employees, such as field crews
that still did not have a workstation.
Council Member Ojakian commended the Auditor for her fine work and asked
that the Report be continued.

Vice Mayor Kleinberg said another way to look at the data was to project
ahead in terms of certain segments in the community that were not well
served. The numbers should tell where annual budget dollars were spent
and the direction the City was going. It was important to look at childcare
services, senior services, and affordable housing to determine which end of
the spectrum needed attention.        She noted that 84 percent of the
community purchased from the Internet, and there was a need to recapture
local sales tax revenue. She raised concern regarding Citywide training
hours that was up almost 200 percent and whether it included temporary or
part-time employees.

Mr. Benest said there was more training required for full-time and regular
part-time staff and occasionally for hourly staff.     There was mandated
training such as in sexual harassment, safety, police and fire.          Many
employees received technical training and a range of discretionary training.
