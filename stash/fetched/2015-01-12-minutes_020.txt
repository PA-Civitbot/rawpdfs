Molly Stump, City Attorney, reported Buena Vista Mobile Home Park (Park)
was a 4 1/2-acre mobile home park in south Palo Alto. Approximately 100
mobile homes, housing approximately 400 people, were located in the Park.
In 2012, the Park owner applied to close the Park. In 2013, the owner
submitted a Relocation Impact Report and completed the process in 2014.
The item was scheduled for hearing before an independent Hearing Officer
who spent three evenings in May 2014 hearing comments from parties, Park
residents, and the public. The Hearing Officer issued a final decision in
September 2014. The decision was appealed to the City Council in October
2014.
