Mr. Perez acknowledged information in appendix J was taken from the IBRC
Report. He noted Staff also had a timeline, but he wanted to address
questions first.

Council Member Shepherd noticed the UUT was broken out between utility
and telephone, and asked if the Council had to go out for both utility and
telephone.

Mr. Perez indicated the current structure required both. He supposed the
Council would have that flexibility if it wanted to make a change.

Council Member Shepherd confirmed the Council could increase the
telephone tax separately.

Council Member Burt asked if funding from the property taxes paid off the
General Obligation Bond.

Mr. Perez stated that was correct.

Council Member Burt suggested Staff should label the funding type as a
property tax.

Mr. Saccio stated the City did not have a parcel tax, so that would have to
be analyzed in terms of the amount of revenue to be raised or the purpose
of the tax.

Council Member Burt inquired if Staff had reviewed a parcel tax.

Mr. Saccio reported IBRC had discussed it, but they did not choose that. He
stated Staff could present some information to the Council.

Council Member Burt asked if Staff had any information.

Mr. Saccio stated there were approximately 20,000 parcels in the City, and
Staff could calculate what a $50 parcel tax would generate.

Council Member Burt inquired if the tax amount was $50 or a $50 increment.

Mr. Saccio said there was no particular increment.

Council Member Burt noted Mr. Saccio had referred to a $50 tax.

Mr. Saccio indicated that was a hypothetical amount.
