Council Member Morton asked how community character was defined and
how it would be implemented with an issue like height.

Mr. Emslie stated the impact of the proposed height would be evaluated in
terms of the visual impact and the Council could make changes to it.

Council Member Morton asked whether the Stanfordâ€™s original ambiance as
well as the impact on Palo Alto would be looked at.

Mr. Emslie stated the open space characteristics were on their list of
concerns and would continue to provide the analysis and recommendation
on any incursions of that character.

Council Member Morton asked to what extend these suggestions would come
to into play.

Mr. Williams stated there would be a proposal from Stanford but they would
analyze alternatives suggested by the Council, community, commission and
staff that were identified as being potentially viable.

Council Member Morton asked whether that would also apply to parking.

Mr. Williams stated he was correct.

Council Member Morton expressed concern with what the capacity levels
would be.

Mr. Emslie stated the peer reviewer would analyze and compare the basis for
the expansion of the hospitals to other communities. The Council, P&TC, and
the Architectural Review Board (ARB) would then have the background to
evaluate the design decisions based on an independent analysis of the
space.

Council Member Morton asked for the City to be clear in regards to what was
expected of Stanford.

Mr. Emslie stated the staff believed that would be one of the benefits of
doing a Development Agreement with the entities involved. This would give
the City a regulatory framework, implementation, phasing, timing and all of
the elements that go into the effective implementation and common
understanding.

Mayor Kishimoto asked how peek capacity would be looked at.
