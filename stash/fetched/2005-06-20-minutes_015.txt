Director of Administrative Services Carl Yeats said the Council could split the
Police and Fire budgets into two separate motions.

POLICE AND FIRE BUDGETS SEPARATED WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER

Council Member Mossar asked whether she and Council Member Cordell could
participate in the Police budget because their conflict pertained to the Fire
budget.

Mr. Yeats said the Police Department also had contractual issues with Stanford
University related to enforcement activities for their football games and
communications.

Council Member Kishimoto said her no vote on the Police budget centered on
the removal of one of two code enforcement positions. The Council had passed
various ordinances and regulations including the leaf blower noise, which were
quality of life and safety issues.

AMENDMENT: Council Member Kishimoto moved, seconded by Freeman, to
add the second Community Services Officer position back in the Police
Department.

THE MAKER OF MOTION WITHDREW HIS CONSENT TO SEPARATE
POLICE AND FIRE BUDGETS

Council Member Ojakian requested the cost of the Community Services Officer
(CSO) position.

Mr. Yeats said the cost was approximately $78,000.

Council Member Ojakian asked Council Member Kishimoto where she believed
those funds would come from.

Mr. Benest said it would be an ongoing addition to the operational base.

Council Member Kishimoto said the monies would probably come from the
Councilâ€™s Contingency Fund for the current year or the bottom line of the
budget. She was open to having a half-time position.

Council Member Ojakian said even with a CSO in place there were a lot of
complaints in the community. He expressed opposition to the motion.

Mr. Yeats clarified the actual cost for the CSO position was $74,000, which
included benefits and pension.
