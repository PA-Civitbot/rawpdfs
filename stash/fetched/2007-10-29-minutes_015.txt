Mayor Kishimoto asked regarding recommendation number six the wording
change because we do want to open the park someday and not keep the
composting forever.

Mr. Roberts stated there was a fine line on how to structure this issue. This
was an attempt to find a balance and not violate any current policy direction
or take away an option to comply with future changes in direction.

Mayor Kishimoto asked whether there would be a difference if “until further
Council direction” was added.

Mr. Roberts stated there needed to be some direction to the proposers on
what they would be doing their first few years that was why the dates were
added.

Mayor Kishimoto asked if for the purpose of the RFP that this be left a
composing operation until 2011.

Mr. Roberts stated that was correct and if the future Council wanted to
change that, it could be renegotiated.

Mayor Kishimoto asked regarding recommendation number four if it should
state “compensation” as opposed to “wages”.

Mr. Roberts stated the employees were not unionized so their compensation
was not based upon union scale of benefits.

Mayor Kishimoto stated she always thought total compensation was more
general then specifying wages. She asked why we wanted to specify a very
high wage that we know that they are getting.

Mr. Roberts asked why we would want to specify a situation that may cause
them to take a cut in their hourly rate and pay in the future.

Ms. Silver stated the existing baseline compensation amount in the RFP
would take into account both wages and benefits and would get breakdowns
of all of the elements.

Mayor Kishimoto asked what the contingency would be if the SMaRT Station
handled the C&D and committed to a 90 percent diversion.

Mr. Roberts stated they were recommending separate contracts and terms
for the processing services, so we could reevaluate where we were.
