Council Member Morton noted that California Avenue’s traffic and businesses
had been impacted with a large number of power outages.

Assistant City Manager Emily Harrison said the Electrical Operations
Engineering staff was going to meet with the California Avenue Development
Association to explain the issues. An information report would be included in
the next packet explaining the deterioration of the undergrounding system in
the area.

Council Member Morton spoke about correspondence received from
individuals in the Charleston/Meadow area regarding foot traffic access
through the Hyatt project.

Director of Planning and Transportation Steve Emslie said direction from the
Council was to preclude access to new developments. He noted if the
undeveloped strip of land between the Elks property and Dinah’s Motel were
redeveloped, it could provide an opportunity for future access from Wilkie
Way and El Camino Real.

Council Member Beecham stated he had passed out an article from the New
York Times regarding water and drought issues in the West and urged his
colleagues to read it.

Council Member Cordell noted on October 30, 2007, City Attorney Gary
Baum would receive an award as Pro Bono Attorney of the Year by the Santa
Clara County Bar Association.
