AGENDA ITEMS

1.     Council Retreat No. 4 for Further Discussion of Infrastructure
       Investment and Renewal. Direction to Staff Regarding Implementation
       Issues Which may Include.

Mayor Yeh stated the Agenda Items were an in-depth discussion of the
Public Safety Building and prioritizing infrastructure projects.

James Keene, City Manager, reported Staff's work on the Public Safety
Building involved collaboration with the Police Chief, Public Works, and the
architectural program consultant regarding alternatives to the original design
of the Public Safety Building. There could be some interconnection between
the Public Safety Building and infrastructure priorities. The Council directed
Staff to prioritize infrastructure projects and to develop a plan and timeline
for a 2014 election. Agenda Item 1B was an effort to obtain the Council's
thoughts to inform Staff's work on prioritizing infrastructure projects. The
City Council should consider the Public Safety Building a priority in order to
provide adequate public safety for the City and to address the danger and
potential of a serious earthquake. A funding possibility had arisen in relation
to another issue before the City. Staff would use that as an illustration of
different methods for funding the building.

       A.   Potential development and Cost Scenarios, and Discussion
            Regarding Public Safety Building.
