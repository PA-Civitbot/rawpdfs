Mr. Ganoung could not comment as he did not work for the Federal
government. The document contained a notice list, which included most
libraries in the area.

Mayor Shepherd inquired whether there was a means for Palo Alto to be
placed on the list.

Mr. Ganoung noted the Metroplex affected four airports in the area:
Oakland, San Jose, San Francisco, and Sacramento.

Council Member Burt asked if Mr. Ganoung meant the graphic was not
representative of Palo Alto's typical experience.

Mr. Ganoung explained the pattern was typical for that given day. Patterns
varied each day.

Council Member Burt asked if patterns varied daily.

Mr. Ganoung replied yes.

Council Member Burt understood patterns were not static; however, on
almost all days Palo Alto was directly affected.

Mr. Ganoung explained that Palo Alto was located directly under Big Sur
arrivals from the south and arrivals on the teardrop pattern from the north.
San Jose arrivals and general aviation traffic were missing from the graphic.
SFO was most likely the cause of noise in that particular graphic.

Council Member Burt inquired whether SFO was aware that Palo Alto
experienced this concentration of traffic.

Mr. Ganoung responded yes.

Council Member Burt asked why SFO was not notifying Palo Alto of the traffic
situation.

Mr. Ganoung reported SFO was not responsible for providing any notice,
because the document did not belong to SFO and SFO procedures were not
being changed. SFO received information just as Palo Alto did.

Council Member Burt noted the Roundtable was comprised of communities
that traditionally experienced a great deal of noise. This information should
have caused a deliberate engagement with Palo Alto.
