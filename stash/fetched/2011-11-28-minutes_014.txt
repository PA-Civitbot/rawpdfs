Council Member Scharff asked for the estimated cost for the Matadero Creek
Undercrossing to be feasible.

Ms. Ames said the cost was estimated at just over $1 million as was Adobe
Creek seasonal project.

Council Member Scharff felt the Mary Bridge in Sunnyvale was a beautiful
example of a crossing but his understanding from Staff was that type of
architecture was out of date.

Mr. Rodriguez said if the City wished to pursue that level of design detail in
order to be competitive there would need to be a larger local funding match

Council Member Scharff asked if there was a figure Staff had in mind of a 10

Mr. Rodriguez said with a project of that magnitude there would be a
minimum of a 20 percent match but a larger number in the range of 35 to
40 percent would be more beneficial.

Council Member Scharff asked if the Alignment D-Enhanced design was
similar to the City of Belmontâ€™s Highway 101 Overcrossing.

Mr. Sartor confirmed the Palo Alto Alignment D-Enhanced design was more
elaborate and wider than the Belmont Overcrossing.

Council Member Scharff said the Alignment D-Enhanced design was between
the Mary Bridge and the Belmont Overcrossing.

Mr. Sartor agreed with the assessment.

Mr. Sartor said it would be closer to the Ralston Avenue Overcrossing.

Council Member Scharff asked if Council approved Staff recommendation,

Amendment to initiate the design and the environmental assessment. Staff
would review the options and the design features for the lightings and
