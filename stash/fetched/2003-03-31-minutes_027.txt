Council Member Kishimoto suggested soliciting the help of the Palo Alto
Mediation Group. She asked whether their services were available to the
City.

City Manager Frank Benest said yes. However, the key issue was whether
there was a real, good faith intent.

City Attorney Ariel Calonne said the Council did not have the authority to
compel any of the stakeholders to go into mediation. He suggested giving
the applicant and proponents an opportunity to make a presentation to the
Council on the Referendum Petition at the April 14, 2003 meeting.

Council Member Kishimoto clarified the applicant and/or the proponents had
an idea of whether they could come up with a compromise.

Mr. Calonne suggested the Council simply allow them the opportunity.

AMENDMENT WITHDRAWN BY MAKER AND SECONDER

Council Member Kishimoto said there were incentives for both sides to
negotiate in good faith. She suggested asking staff to help call a meeting
together to assist the stakeholders in agreeing on a process for moving
forward.

Mr. Benest said he did not believe it was proper for staff to call a meeting in
that type of situation. If the various parties came forward and expressed to
Council their desire to work in good faith, the Council could then direct staff
to be supportive.

Mr. Calonne said the Referendum circulators could not negotiate in a way
that delivered assurances to the applicant or the City.

Council Member Morton asked under what circumstances could the motion
be voted on.

Mr. Calonne said the motion needed a call for previous question or closed
debate with a second and a two-thirds vote for approval. If it were
successful, the Council would immediately vote on the pending motion.

MOTION FOR PREVIOUS QUESTION moved by Council Member Morton,
seconded by Burch.

MOTION FOR PREVIOUS QUESTION PASSED 7-2, Freeman, Ojakian
“no.”
