Russell Targ, 1010 Harriet Street, said environmental justice did not give
anyone the right to pollute the air or disturb the peace in a residential
neighborhood.

Patricia Phillips, 1010 Harriet Street, said a leaf blower ban in Los Angeles
had not caused gardeners to lose their jobs.

Tammie Pereira, 143 Louise Lane, San Mateo, said the cost of maintenance
would increase if leaf blowers were banned.

Dan Skinner, 30305 Bradham Drive, Visalia, said new technology would
produce a hybrid four-stroke leaf blower to address the sound level.

Council Member Beecham asked whether staff had information on the 65-
decibel (dBA) leaf blower and if it was available.

Mr. Skinner said he would provide staff with the information and that it was
available.

Council Member Morton asked whether the backpack leaf blower was a four-
stroke model.

Mr. Skinner said two manufacturers were currently working on a four-stroke
hybrid engine backpack leaf blower.

Council Member Morton said the leaf blower met the dBA requirements.

Mr. Skinner said the test result information was for that particular leaf
blower.

Michael Hertzer, 214 Cristich Lane, #101, Campbell, said he opposed the
outright ban on the gas leaf blower. He indicated there were four-stroke
engine leaf blowers that met the 65-dBA requirements.

Rita Morgin, 600 Channing Avenue, said gas-powered leaf blowers were a
problem for air quality.

Dale Johnson, 2327 Sierra Avenue, said he had increased health problems
from leaf blowers.

Elizabeth Lee, 2327 Sierra Court, said the American Lung Association
recommended against gas leaf blowers.

Valerie Voight, 3028 Emerson Street, said individuals who used leaf blowers
needed to respect the rules regarding hours of use.
