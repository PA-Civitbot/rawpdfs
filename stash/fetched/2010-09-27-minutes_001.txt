STUDY SESSION

2.   Discussion on Proposed Changes to the City’s Green Building Program
     to Integrate the City’s Requirements With the California Green Building
     Code and Add Criteria for Sustainable Neighborhood Developments.

Kristin Parineh of the Planning and Community Environment presented the
Staff report. The purpose for the Study Session was to provide the Council
with an overview of the California Green Building Code and to receive
comments on proposed changes to the City’s Green Building Program. The

Green, Green Point Rated (BIG, GPR). Staff also proposed to expand the
existing scope of green building regulations to include provisions for
                                                                   09/27/10
