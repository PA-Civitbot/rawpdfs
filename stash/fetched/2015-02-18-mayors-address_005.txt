The Rinconda Library, formerly Main Library, opened this past weekend on Valentine’s
Day. This is the perfect merging of Steward and Entrepreneur as the project incorporates
new technologies in a restored 1958 Edward Durell Stone building. The whole campus
with the Art Center is very well executed. It’s a beautiful facility, and I hope you will visit it
soon if you haven’t already.

We enjoy great weather and a lively economy.

Our lives are not particularly threatened by crime.

We live in a place that is home to Nobel Prize winners, a world class university,

Slide         Stanford Quad




and all manner of luminaries and innovators who live quietly among us

as well as ordinary people who may never do anything more remarkable than be just the
right mom or dad to deserving kids. And what can be more important than that.

But there also is much to be done to meet your rightful expectations and to continue our
heritage as both Stewards and Entrepreneurs.

We are, and have long been, entrepreneurs. Recognizing that we are both stewards and
entrepreneurs, that these are close relatives rather than distant kin will, in my opinion,
help define our community’s future and maintain our quality of life.

So returning to the numbers…..
