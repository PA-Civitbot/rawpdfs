Council Member Kleinberg said if the motion would lead to an analysis of
whether to have employee layoffs, she did not believe it was the right time
and would not support the motion.

Mayor Beecham expressed his opposition to the motion. He said he would
rely on the City Auditor’s assessment on Span of Control. He also pointed
out the degree of quality demanded from the City was high, and believed it
would be difficult to find comparisons from other cities with the same quality
of administrative staff. Palo Alto was the only City in California that owned
and operated five utilities. He was concerned about the level of overhead in
administration, but did not see an effective way to assess whether the City
was at the right point.

MOTION FAILED 2-6, Cordell, Freeman yes, Kishimoto absent.

Council Member Ojakian acknowledged and applauded the members of the
budget staff for their hard work.

Mr. Yeats acknowledged Deputy Fire Chief Debra Pryor who completed an
internship in the Budget Division.

Mayor Beecham said the City staff routinely received awards for having the
best presented budget, format, and procedures. Any comparisons to other
cities would not reveal the demands and quality placed on staff.

RECESS: 9:52 p.m. – 10:00 p.m.

Council Member Morton left the meeting at this point.
