                                                                                                               10.d




 1   intersections. It shows that a tremendous number of vehicles that would have to be there in that
 2   peak hour, nearly double the existing number. So if you take all the traffic that is coming there
 3   now you would have to have that much more traffic, and we just don’t think that the
 4   intensification of the California Avenue Concept Plan area would result in that. Once you take




                                                                                                                      Attachment: Attachment D: P&TC Excerpt Minutes of January 12, 2011 (1320 : California Avenue Neg Dec and CIP)
 5   that and when we do get to that point of having a plan to analyze we will be looking at where
 6   those cars go, and a lot of them are not even going to use California Avenue in some of the areas
 7   if they are not proximate to it. A lot of folks today don’t use California Avenue itself they will
 8   use Sherman or Cambridge rather than stopping along California Avenue. So there are a lot of
 9   different routing things to look at as well as the different uses have different peak periods that
10   they generate traffic. So we did talk through that. We talked about trying to maybe do some
11   analysis for every one of those intersections and how much more. It was clear that some of them
12   would take ten times as much traffic as currently exits, but it was at like a minimum 76 percent
13   or 80 percent increase over the existing volumes at that peak hour to even get us down to the
14   Level of Service D let along E, which is unacceptable.

16   Chair Tuma: Great, thanks very much. Commissioner Keller followed by Commissioner
17   Fineberg.
18
19   Commissioner Keller: Thank you. first I appreciate my fellow Commissioner Garber talking
20   about the potential for the Performing Arts garage with it and hotel, to save me the trouble of
21   asking those questions.
22
23   So my first question is did we get this grant in part because California Avenue was designated a
24   priority development area? Did that get us points? If it had not been designated a priority
25   development area would that mean that we would be less likely or perhaps wouldn’t get the
26   grant?
27
28   Mr. Rodriguez: Yes. In order to actually be considered for the grant you actually need to be
29   within one of those zones or immediately adjacent to some type of a transit station, which
30   California Avenue falls under. So it was one of the primary reasons why this project was well
31   received.
32
33   Commissioner Keller: Thank you. So another quick comment just in passing is when you do the
34   urban design of how this works I hope you study the issue of newspaper racks and media racks
35   and such, and the proliferation of those on California Avenue and figure out how to do a better
36   design for that.
37
38   Did the traffic analysis study the impact of the 45 degree angled parking, which I think is a
39   steeper parking. It is steeper with respect to the flow of traffic, of that on the traffic flow. Did
40   the traffic flow study the nature of the parking and the effects of that parking on the traffic flow?
41
42   Mr. Rodriguez: I will try and answer the question and then I will let Bret follow us if he has any
43   additional comments. When we asked Hexagon to look at the concept plan we specifically said
44   for most of the corridor we came up with 60 degrees because that is what helps us maximize the
45   parking availability on the street. Really, one of the reasons why that was done is because we are
