Mr. Emslie said whether there was a shift in policy could not be determined
at the time.

Council Member Cordell asked how long it would take to do the feasibility
study.

Mr. Emslie said approximately three to four months.

Council Member Cordell said if the proposal were pursued it would delay the
Baylands Update by 90 to 120 days, and she questioned Council Member
Beecham’s delay concern.

Council Member Beecham said it was a matter of management. The Council
had set priorities and established a work plan. There would be a better
policy and conceptual sense of the Baylands Master Plan if the proposal were
pursued after the Update.

Vice Mayor Kleinberg clarified she heard Mr. Emslie state the redesign would
not be considered in the Baylands Master Plan.

Mr. Emslie said that was correct.

MOTION PASSED 5-2, Mossar, Beecham no, Freeman, Ojakian absent.

Council Member Mossar left the meeting at 9:25 p.m.

adjoining property owner could appeal the Director’s Decision.          The
Ordinance required a minimum of four council members agreeing to set a
hearing for the appeal. The item was not a hearing on the appeal, but
