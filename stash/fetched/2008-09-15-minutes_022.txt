Mr. Williams stated most commercial buildings had fairly high ceilings,
starting generally at fourteen feet.

Council Member Morton asked if staff had any concerns about the basement
space being seen as limited to mechanical use or retail storage.

Mr. Williams stated the code currently listed it as unusable space because it
was less than seven feet in height.

Council Member Morton clarified once the area was deemed for mechanical
equipment and or retail space it could not be altered for other uses in the
future.

Mr. Williams stated that was correct.

Council Member Kishimoto asked about the Design Enhancement Exceptions
(DEEâ€™s) and the Floor Area Ratios (FAR) exceptions for the basement. She
stated the DEE Ordinance read a DEE could not be given to increase floor
area. Staff had also mentioned the Director could exempt an area from
being usable by calling it unusable. The Ordinance read it had to be unusable
and used specifically for Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), seismic or
energy efficiency.

Mr. Williams asked whether she was looking at the definition for the floor
area.

Council Member Kishimoto stated no, she had looked at the Municipal Code
in section 18 although did not recall the exact sub-section.

Mr. Williams elected staff to review the section and report back.

Council Member Barton asked for clarification regarding the basements
inhabitability. There were code regulations for height, ventilation and natural
light. The area in question did not meet these requirements and therefore
would not be habitable.

Mr. Williams concurred that the basement did not meet the required code
regulations for habitability.

Mayor Klein asked if this was an unreinforced basement. In the history of
Palo Alto there had been thirty-five unreinforced basements he questioned
how many remained.

Mr. Williams stated yes the project had an unreinforced basement. He
