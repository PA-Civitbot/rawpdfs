back to the P&TC with specific instructions for them to return with a four-lot
subdivision.

Mayor Beecham asked whether the Council could vote on a four lot that
evening.

Mr. Baum said they could vote on a four lot but, in order to get over the
objections of the applicants attorney, it would be advisable to refer the
project back to the P&TC with directions for four parcels.

Mr. Emslie said the City Subdivision Ordinance established the P&TC as the
recommending body.

Council Member Cordell said she would like to see the applicant go forward.
She would like to see it return to the P&TC. The Tentative Map would be
denied.

Mr. Baum said the first map should be denied.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION PASSED 8-1, Beecham no.
