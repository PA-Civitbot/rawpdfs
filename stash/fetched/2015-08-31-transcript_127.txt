Mayor Holman: Thank you for staying abreast of that and for bringing us up
to speed on it.

Council Member Berman: Thank you, Madam Mayor. I just want to kind of
implore you and all of us that we need to start getting control over our
meetings. This our third meeting after break. The first one went to 1:30.
The second one went 'til 12:30. It's now almost 12:15. We had practically
no public comment. The agenda's supposed to end at 11:00. We have
policies that say that we'll do check-ins at certain times. I don't know what
the solution is, but it's really tough to go to work in the morning and be
productive after these really early morning meetings.

Mayor Holman: Understand and appreciate that. When you take a look at
the agendas that we have and the things that we have to agendize, it's a
real challenge.

Council Member Berman: I think part of it is that we need meeting
management. When we start off a half hour, 45 minutes behind schedule an
hour and a half into the meeting, I think they are improvements that we can
make above and beyond the agenda.

Mayor Holman:    That's, of course, how long each of us speak is a part of
that too.

Council Member Berman: It is.

Mayor Holman: Assistant City Manager, City Attorney, anything to add?
Except just good night. Meeting adjourned.

Adjournment: The meeting was adjourned at 12:16 A.M.
