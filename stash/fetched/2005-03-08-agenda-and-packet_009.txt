Representation of Private Interests
In keeping with their role as stewards of the public interest, members of Council shall not
appear on behalf of the private interests of third parties before the Council or any other
board, commission or proceeding of the City, nor shall members of boards and
commissions appear before their own bodies or before the Council on behalf of the
private interests of third parties on matters related to the areas of service of their bodies.

Advocacy
Members shall represent the official policies or positions of the City Council, board or
commission to the best of their ability when designated as delegates for this purpose.
When presenting their individual opinions and positions, members shall explicitly state
they do not represent their body or the City, nor will they allow the inference that they do.

Positive Work Place Environment
Members shall support the maintenance of a positive and constructive work place
environment for City employees and for citizens and businesses dealing with the City.
Members shall recognize their special role in dealings with City employees to in no way
create the perception of inappropriate direction to staff.
