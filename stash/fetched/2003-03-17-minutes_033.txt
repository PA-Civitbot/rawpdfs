Mr. Calonne clarified he did not hear staff indicate that the building would be
of more value with the spine.

Mayor Mossar clarified that staff did not say building would be of more value.

Council Member Freeman said because in a time of financial crisis she hoped
a mistake would not be made by destroying something that was
irreplaceable.

Mayor Mossar said she would be more comfortable in agreeing to spend the
money for this important structure if Council had a comparable $500,000
item on their wish list that they would be willing to drop in exchange.

Vice Mayor Beecham felt the spine was not an attractive artifact to leave up
next to the park. He said when staff indicated the cost to renovate was
$2,000,000 and $2,000,000 to rebuild the structure, he called it equal, but
to consider $440,000 to not tear it down is a loss.
MOTION PASSED 6-3, Beecham, Mossar, Ojakian “no.”
