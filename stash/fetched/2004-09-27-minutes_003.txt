STUDY SESSION

1.   Affordable Housing (Alma Substation â€“ Below Market Rate (BMR)
     Program Study Update)

Linda Mandolini, the Executive Director of Eden Housing, gave a short
presentation regarding the preliminary work that has been completed
regarding housing development options for the Alma Substation site. She
described the three development options studied, including seniors, Single
Room Occupancy (SRO) and workforce housing, as well as the benefits and
constraints for each option. The Council comments focused on parking
requirements and parking provisions for the project and on the varying
options. Most of the Council Members indicated preference for workforce
housing on the site; however, given the site's constraints, senior housing
was also a viable alternative. Most of the Council Members emphasized
future public parking at the adjacent 800 High Street site should not be used
to provide parking for the project.

Kate Funk and Debbie Kern from Keyser Marston Associates briefly explained
the Below Market Rate (BMR) Program study that had just begun which
would evaluate additional opportunities for producing and retaining
affordable housing, as well as address potential improvements to
administrative procedures. The Council Members described specific issues
that the study should address including restrictions on income limits for BMR
owners, identifying reasons for owners selling units, evaluating the
appreciation formula and identifying methods of limiting BMR Program
administration costs.

No action required.

ADJOURNMENT: The meeting adjourned at 7:10 p.m.
