Figure 2: Summary of mercury concentrations in Palo Alto sludge cake’ Dental offices were
required to install amalgam separators 2005. (Average mercury concentration in sludge cake
before amalgam separators was 397 µg/kg. Current 6-month average mercury concentration in
sludge cake is 148 µg/kg, more than a 60 percent reduction.)

C. EPA Overestimated Baseline Emissions for Mercury

The proposed rule incorrectly estimates that the 218 existing SSIs emit 3.1 tons of
mercury per year to the atmosphere. In 2009 the Water Environment Research
Foundation released a report titled Minimizing Mercury Emissions in Biosolids
Incinerators. The report conservatively determined that SSIs collectively emit less than
one ton of mercury to the atmosphere each year.

After careful review of the spreadsheets in the attachments to the proposed rule, we found
that EPA grossly overestimated the baseline emissions for mercury. EPA’s baseline
mercury emissions have been overestimated both for facilities that responded to EPA’s
Information Collection Request (ICR) survey and for facilities, such as Palo Alto, for
which data from the ICR facilities was used to develop estimates. Central Contra Costa
Sanitation District (CCCSD) is one of the nine facilities that responded to EPA’s ICR.
We have reviewed both EPA's emission calculation as well as the actual source test data
from CCCSD’s December 2009 source test and have concluded that ERG, EPA’s
consultant for the proposed rule, overestimated CCCSD’s mercury emissions by 77
percent. ERG multiplied concentration data corrected to 7 percent O2 with uncorrected
flue gas flow rate data. For CCCSD, the flue gas flow during the source test contained 13
percent O2. The proper way to calculate emissions is by either (a) multiplying
concentration data corrected to 7 percent O2 by flue gas flow rate data corrected to 7
