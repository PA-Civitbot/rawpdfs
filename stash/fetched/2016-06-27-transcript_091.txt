Council Member Kniss: That should be in there.

Council Member Wolbach: I'm okay with adding the word balance in there
too.

Council Member Holman: (crosstalk) Hold on just a minute. If you have a
member from Stanford University, somebody from the TMA, somebody from
Palo Alto Unified School District (PAUSD) and a resident, it needs to not be
stacked by numbers The representation needs to be broad, but the numbers
need to be balanced.

Mayor Burt: Can I offer ...

Council Member Wolbach:       I'm fine with adding the word balance in there
too.

AMENDMENT:      Council Member Wolbach moved, seconded by Council
Member XX to add to Motion Part C, “committee members would ideally
include but not be limited to Stanford University, the Transportation
Management Association (TMA), Palo Alto Unified School District (PAUSD),
residents, Stanford Research Park (SRP) Transportation Demand
Management (TDM) Working Group.”

Mayor Burt:     If it was to say "a balance of residents and business
representatives," then you could go on to say "including representatives
from the following."

Council Member Wolbach: That would be absolutely fine with me.             Again,
it's ideal but not prescriptive.

Council Member Kniss: That's a good improvement. That's good.

Council Member Wolbach:       This is just to get us started on the right foot.
Thank you for ...

Council Member Holman: Does that still identify that it's a balance of
numbers as well as interests?

Council Member Wolbach:       I think "balance of business and residents" is
pretty clear.

Council Member Holman: Okay.
