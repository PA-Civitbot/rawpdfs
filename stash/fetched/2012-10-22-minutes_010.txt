                               MINUTES

Ms. Slater answered yes. One change could be turning down the thermostat
on water heaters.

Vice Mayor Scharff inquired whether all changes were listed in the Low
Carbon Diet book or would more changes be developed.

Ms. Slater felt the changes would be those listed in the book and others.
Each community would decide its focus for change.

Vice Mayor Scharff wanted to know who would be making the decision on
which changes to implement.

Ms. Slater reported the project would provide the Low Carbon Diet book
along with a Palo Alto version of the Low Carbon Diet, which may have
expanded programs. The Low Carbon diet was a living document based on
the community. Each Eco Team would decide where to make changes, and
each household within the Eco Team would decide what it wanted to change.
Each Eco Team and each household could be different.

Mr. Bobel indicated participating cities would have a role in focusing
changes. For example, greenhouse gas emissions from transportation was
the least addressed area in Palo Alto, while emissions from electric utilities
was the most addressed area. It would be appropriate for the City to focus
changes on transportation.    He did not believe the decision on which
changes to implement would be left to the individual Eco Teams without
some community push.

Vice Mayor Scharff was concerned about community enthusiasm for the
program because no public speakers appeared.

Mr. Bobel felt the community spoke at the Study Session and did not
suggest more speakers appear for the current discussion.

Vice Mayor Scharff asked for the percentage of Palo Alto's electric
households participating in Palo Alto Green.

Mr. Bobel was unsure of the exact percentage.

Vice Mayor Scharff believed it was approximately 20 percent.

Mr. Bobel agreed.
