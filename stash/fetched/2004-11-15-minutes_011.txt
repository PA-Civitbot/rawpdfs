MOTION: Council Member Ojakian moved, seconded by Morton, to approve
the Zero Waste Policy and for staff to return to the Council with an
implementation plan.

MOTION PASSED 9-0.

     b)    City Auditor’s Review of Environmental Services Center Proposal

Mayor Beecham suggested Council Members ask questions of staff that
evening, direct staff to bring back the item on November 22, 2004, for a
study session, and return the item on a date uncertain.

Ms. Harrison suggested an option to have an extended study session to
allow the Council to discuss the issue, and then bring the item back under
‘Unfinished Business.’

Mayor Beecham said the issue was an important one for the community and
the Council, and suggested setting the matter for an extended study
session, followed by bringing the item back again at a later date.

Ms. Harrison said the item as ‘Unfinished Business’ would most likely come
back in January 2005.

Council Member Morton said ordinarily a study session did not allow the
Council to take action. He asked whether the item would be listed as an
agenda item and study session.

Ms. Harrison said staff would advertise an extended study session. The
Council would thereafter adjourn the study session, and come back into
session with the ‘Unfinished Business’ item in front of them.

Council Member Mossar clarified it was not Council’s intent to take action
following the extended study session.

Ms. Harrison said the Council would have the option to take action because
the item would be on the agenda under ‘Unfinished Business’. If the Council
were not ready, they would continue to a date in January 2005.

Mayor Beecham said the Council needed to vote on whether they wanted to
agendize the item for a study session only or to include the item for
potential action.

Council Member Freeman asked whether the public hearing would be
reopened for potential speakers.
