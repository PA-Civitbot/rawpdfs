Change Order #8 was negotiated as a package and a breakdown of its
components were noted in Staff Report ID#2242, page 4. He said hand-out
Attachment E was in response to the Council’s request regarding the number
of outstanding change orders that were pending negotiations.            As of
November 14, 2011, there were over $4 million in pending change orders.


Council Member Klein stated that the outstanding change orders were at 62
percent of the project and asked if there was any indication of any additional
change orders coming from the contractors.


Mr. Sartor stated that was unknown at this time.


Council Member Klein asked if the contractors had been asked.


Mr. Sartor stated they had and the contractors had given Staff all the
change orders they had up to this point.


Mr. Keene stated that Staff was opposed to the increase in change orders
and hoped the amount would decrease through negotiations. He said strong
project management should continue to be the key in the project.


Council Member Klein spoke regarding the contingency amounts and said the
expectation should be to not spend the full amount approved by the Council.
A 20 percent contingency was a large amount and the major reason for the
monthly reports was to see how the project was progressing.


Mr. Keene stated he agreed with Council Member Klein and that the 20
percent was a ceiling.   Staff’s focus was to keep the contingency close to
minimum as possible.
