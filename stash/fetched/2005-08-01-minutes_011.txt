approve the policy but, due to the sensitivity of the subject, he wanted to be
responsive to the Council’s concerns prior to approving the policy.

Mayor Burch clarified what was before the Council was a procurement issue.

Mr. Benest said that was correct.

Vice Mayor Kleinberg said she thought the policy was supposed to be brought
back to the Council for feedback. She asked whether it was permissible to
discuss the policy since it was not agendized, but was an attachment to the
staff report (CMR:341:05).

City Attorney Gary Baum said the Council was allowed to provide formal
guidance and comments since it was attached to the agenda and part of a
prior agenda item.

Vice Mayor Kleinberg said she would be registering a “no” vote if the policy
could not be discussed.

Mayor Burch clarified what was set before the Council was a purchase request
authorization to purchase material for installation in one patrol car for a 30-
day test period.

Ms. Johnson clarified the request was to approve purchase of an entire
system.

Mayor Burch said he understood but a portion of the 30-day test was to be
further refined in the policy.

Ms. Johnson said only from a technological aspect.

Mayor Burch said the policy dictated how and when cameras would be used,
but it did not change the fact of installing cameras in police vehicles.

Ms. Johnson said that was correct.

Mayor Burch clarified what was before the Council was a request to approve a
purchase and could go forward concurrent with a policy.

Council Member Cordell said the public should have been notified regarding
discussion of the policy to allow public input on the issue.

Council Member Beecham clarified the Council was the decision-making body
for community policies and the City Manager for operational policies. The
Council could provide input on operational policies but Council action was not
required.
