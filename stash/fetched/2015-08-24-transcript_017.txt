     Quality Act under CEQA Guidelines Section 15061(b) and 15301,
     15302 and 15305. (FIRST READING: June 29, 2015, Passed: 8-0,
     DuBois absent).‚Äù

6.   Approval of Memorandum of Understanding Between the City of
     Palo Alto and Caltrain Regarding Vegetation Removal and
     Fencing Enhancements and an Intrusion Detection Camera System
     Beta Test in the Caltrain Corridor in Palo Alto and Budget
     Amendment Ordinance 5341.

Mayor Holman: All those in favor. I think what you want to do, Council
Member DuBois, is you want to vote yes, but you want to lodge no votes on
Number 2 and Number 6.

Council Member DuBois: Yes, that's correct.

Mayor Holman: If you would like to speak further to why you're voting no
on "2" and "6," that's the procedure.

Council Member DuBois: That's what I meant to do. Again, I'm just
concerned about the rate that we're spending the Project Safety Net
money, that we're approving an additional 390,000 here. We just recently
approved hiring a Director. We've had the guards 24/7 even during the
summer months, and then we're doing a pilot on this automatic detection
system.      If we move forward with that, it's another 170,000 per
installation. For those reasons, I'm voting no.

Mayor Holman: The motion on the Consent Calendar to approve it passed
on a 9-0 vote with Council Member DuBois lodging no votes on Items
Number 2 and 6.

MOTION FOR AGENDA ITEM NUMBERS 3-5 PASSED: 9-0

MOTION FOR AGENDA ITEM NUMBERS 2 AND 6 PASSED: 8-1 DuBois
no

Mayor Holman: While Staff is getting in their places, it might be an
appropriate time to just mention a couple of quick things, just a couple of
administrative things. If Council Members can wait to be acknowledged
when they want to speak, it really helps us have orderly meetings. This is
the first time all of us have been together for a good while. There are a few
notable exceptions to that. One of them is if you want to second a motion,
just speak up. The other is that when Council Members turn your lights on,
I make note of who's turned their lights on, and I do call on people in the
order in which they've turned their lights on. I don't shuffle those light
                                                                        Page 17 of 81
