Mayor Yeh noted that Mark Michael of the Planning                      and
Transportation Commission (PTC) was in attendance.                      He
disclosed that he met with the Applicant and visited the site.          He
also had several telephone calls with the Applicant, but all           the
information that was shared with him was available and in              the
public record.

Planning and Community Environment Department Planner, Amy
French said the PTC voted 6-0 in support of the site and design
review application to create a daycare center for 117 children
within the existing building and associated site modifications.
The daycare center was a permitted use within the Research,
Office, and Limited Manufacturing District (ROLM).      The site
modifications involved the use of existing asphalt areas at the
rear and side of the building as two fenced play areas. She said
