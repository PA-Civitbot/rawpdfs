Mayor Holman: Maker, seconder?

Council Member Burt: Great.

Council Member Kniss: Mm-hmm.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to add Part D to the Motion, “Council reaffirms its
commitment of setting a maximum threshold of 600 Total Dissolved Solids
(TDS).”

Mayor Holman: I am complete here except that I really do want to thank
Council Member Burt and Council Member Scharff both for your comments,
questions and Council Member Scharff for his support of Council Member
Burt's comments. I thought they were reflective of the experience you've
had dealing with water and also on the committee that you're chairing right
now. Thank you for your efforts on our behalf.

Council Member Burt: I neglected to ask one question. On Slide Number 9,
the first bullet, it says Recycled Water Project is estimated to cost 35 million
or $2,700 per acre foot. How many acre feet would we recycle per year?

Mr. Bobel: Currently?

Council Member Burt: I don't know. I don't know what this is describing
actually. How do you—what got divided by what to get $2,700 an acre ...

Ms. North: The projection for the project is 900 acre feet based on the
Facility Plan. That's what would be used on that pipeline.

Council Member Burt: 900 acre feet ...

Ms. North: Per year.

Council Member Burt: ... per year.

Male: (inaudible)

Council Member Burt: Slide 9, first bullet. It's 900 acre feet per year. Then
how do you get this $2,700 per acre foot.
