Council Member Ojakian said projects had to be evaluated on the type
of benefits provided to the City.

Council Member Freeman referred to Item c, that the RT-50 zone for
the FAR would be established by the PC project, the no FAR limit
should be changed to a 2.0 FAR limit, as described in A-2. in the
General Questions provided to the Council.

Council Member Kishimoto asked for a summary of A-2.

Council Member Freeman responded that A-2. indicated that designs
that used a 1.5 FAR in the RT-35 district and a 2 FAR in the RT-50
yielded 120 dwelling units. Further, “an additional 90-120 units in
phase 2 would be within the ranged analyzed in the EIR.”

Council Member Kishimoto said A-2 did not propose a FAR cap.

Council Member Freeman said what the Council was asked to vote on
did not have an FAR cap, that is, no FAR limit for RT-50 zones. A 2.0
FAR limit was proposed, because the 2.0 FAR fit in with the EIR
analysis. She withdrew her second to the amendment.

SECOND

SUBSTITUTE MOTION AS AMENDED PASSED 4-3, Freeman,
Kishimoto, Lytle “no,” Morton, Mossar “not participating.”

Council Member Freeman said the Council was split on how it
envisioned growth in the City. Getting a majority vote was difficult
unless the Council could work on something better that would
compromise from both ends.

Council Member Lytle said she would not be able to support a final
ordinance that came back with the approved motion. There would be
too much pressure for luxury housing and overdevelopment in areas
where the Council wanted to go more moderately with balanced
growth.

Council Member Kishimoto said speculation on the land drove up the
cost for potential developers of BMR property. Page 8 of the BAE
report compared rental projects with condominiums and explained why
