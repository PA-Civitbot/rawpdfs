Sustainable Communities Strategy legislation. The implications surrounded
climate action programs and environmental impacts.

Mr. Keene stated Staff did not foresee concerns with Resolution 3, as it had
no targeted issue.

Council Member Holman stated AB32 and SB375 had good intentions;
however, applying their applications could pose a struggle. Staff had alluded
that the City Council could enact local rules to help contain implications
regarding SB375.

Mr. Larkin stated there was a provision in SB375 that stated nothing in the
bill would remove local control over planning decisions.

Council Member Schmid inquired whether supporting SB375 would support
the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) allocations.

Mr. Larkin stated SB375 was not intentionally related to ABAG allocations.

Council Member Holman inquired whether the City Council had the ability to
separate AB375 from the Resolution.

Council Member Klein stated he did not foresee amendments being made to
these Resolutions at the League Annual Conference.

MOTION PASSED: 9-0

MOTION:      Council Member Scharff moved, seconded by Vice Mayor
Espinosa to direct its delegate to oppose the proposed Resolution Number 4.

Council Member Shepherd believed Resolution 4 was to provide transparency
to banks when investing in the community.

Council Member Scharff believed Resolution 4 would place pressure on banks
to make investments, which they would normally not make, within the City
that they did business in. He stated loans may be taken away from smaller
cities, such as Palo Alto.

Council Member Yeh stated the Federal Community Reinvestment Act was a
powerful example for cities deciding on their own initiatives. He felt SB375
may not be appropriate for some cities and would be best left to individual
cities to decide.
