determine the need and what the response would be. A campaign could be
done privately by individuals.

Council Member Cordell asked how soon a business license tax would come
before the voters.

Mr. Yeats believed it should go on a General Municipal election ballot, which
would occur in November 2007.

Council Member Cordell asked when the bond measure for the library and
the police building would be placed on the ballot.

Mr. Yeats believed it would the same exact time.

Council Member Cordell asked which city had a business registry fee.

Mr. Yeats said Diamond Bar, which was located in southern California.

Council Member Cordell asked whether it was safe to assume the cities that
did not have a business registry but had a business license tax, generated
the same data a city would get from a registry.

Mr. Yeats said yes.

Council Member Cordell asked if staff knew whether Diamond Bar had
effectively gathered data using the business registry fee.

Mr. Saccio said staff did not have that information, but it was easy to obtain.

Council Member Barton asked whether a revenue neutral fee required voter
approval.

Mr. Baum said he did not believe so; however, it would have to be revenue
neutral.

Council Member Klein asked if there was a clear distinction between a
business registry fee and a business license tax.

Mr. Yeats said the distinction was the intent. He believed the rate on a
business license tax could be raised without voter approval.

Mr. Baum clarified a business license tax in any community, since approval
of Proposition 218, required voter approval to increase the rate. A business
registry was not a tax, but a fee that paid for services rendered.
