Council Member Scharff: Okay, that's good. I'm good with that.

INCORPORATED INTO THE SUBSTITUTE MOTION WITH THE
CONSENT OF THE MAKER AND SECONDER to replace in the Substitute
Motion, “a pacing mechanism for non-residential, non-retail growth” with
“pacing mechanisms for office and R/D development and its impact on the
jobs housing balance.”

Mayor Holman: For office, R&D development and its impact on jobs-housing
balance. You're good with that, so I'm done. Council Member Wolbach.

Council Member Wolbach: I was going to offer a substitute, but I think
actually the substitute motion that's been proposed by Council Member
Scharff and seconded by the Mayor is pretty good. I'd like to suggest a
friendly amendment to that. That would be—let me see if I can figure out
how to plug it into this. Direct the CAC to look at—actually it would be
"pacing or mitigation mechanisms." I would actually suggest expanding this.
Let's balance it. There are more impacts of development and jobs than just
on the jobs-housing imbalance. I would open it up to also suggest adding
"impact on jobs-housing imbalance and other community impacts." I was
thinking about ones like traffic, parking, schools, etc.

Council Member Scharff: I'll do what Council Member DuBois always does,
which I think is a worthwhile approach. I might be persuaded of it, but I'd
like to see it as a separate amendment.

Mayor Holman: Council Member Wolbach? An amendment.

Council Member Wolbach: I'm offering an amendment to the substitute
motion to add the text in bold.

Mayor Holman: Is there a second to that?

Council Member Wolbach: If somebody will second it, I will elaborate on my
reasoning, which I think many will find reasonable.

Mayor Holman: I'm not hearing a second.

AMENDMENT TO THE SUBSTITUTE MOTION: Council Member Wolbach
moved, seconded by Council Member XX to add to the Substitute Motion, “or
mitigation” after “at pacing” and “and other community impacts” after
“housing balance.”

AMENDMENT TO THE SUBSTITUTE MOTION FAILED DUE TO THE LACK
OF A SECOND
