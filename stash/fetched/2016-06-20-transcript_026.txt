Council Member Wolbach: Yeah. It's about a half mile, I think.

Mr. Mello: Yeah.

Council Member Wolbach: At the other end of Loma Verde, at Loma Verde
and Alma, Loma Verde's approximately equidistant between the
undercrossing at California Avenue (Cal. Ave.) for bike and ped and at the
other end, the crossing at Meadow. It's about 0.7 to Cal. Ave. and 0.6 to
Meadow. Right?

Mr. Mello: Yeah, that looks about right.

Council Member Wolbach: Colorado at Alma—actually Colorado's—we've
pretty much ruled that out because it's too narrow anyway. I'm trying to
figure out what the differences are and how striking the differences between
East Meadow and Loma Verde. We're already planning to do a Class IV
bikeway on Meadow. Correct?

Mr. Mello: Yes. We're working on that concept plan right now.

Council Member Wolbach: I guess I would just like a little bit more clarity
from Staff on why a Class IV bike lane would work well for Meadow but not
for Loma Verde.

Mr. Mello: For Meadow, we're looking at two one-way, separated bikeways
so cyclists would be traveling in the proper direction of travel with motor
vehicles. Loma Verde, without removing all of the parking on both sides, the
only thing you can accommodate is a two-way, separated bikeway, which is
shown in the ...

Council Member Wolbach:       Are we removing parking on both sides on
Meadow?

Mr. Mello: Meadow is much wider, and there's an opportunity to have a
parking-protected, separated bikeway along the majority of Meadow.

Council Member Wolbach: Basically we get to preserve more parking on
Meadow because it's wider.
