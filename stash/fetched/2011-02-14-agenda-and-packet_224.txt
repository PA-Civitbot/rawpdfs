 9   Project. We will start with a presentation from Staff and then go to the public. Staff, I believe
10   has a presentation for us, but before we get started with that I would like to say congratulations
11   to Jaime on his new child who was just born yesterday. So amazing dedication for you to be
12   here tonight and we appreciate that. Obviously shows how seriously you take this, and thank
13   you very much.

18   1.       California Avenue – Transit Hub Corridor Improvements Project:
19            Recommendation of approval of the Negative Declaration for the California Avenue
20            streetscape project that includes a proposed 4-lane to 2-lane reduction between El
21            Camino Real and the California Avenue – Park Plaza.
22
23   Mr. Curtis Williams, Director of Planning and Community Environment: Thank you Chair
24   Tuma and Commissioners. We are here tonight to discuss with you the proposed environmental
25   review and CIP project for the California Avenue streetscape project. We are focused on those
26   couple of items and want to clarify that the design specifics of a number of the features of the
27   streetscape will still be under review for some time after approval of the environmental
28   documents as we move closer to construction in early 2012.
29
30   The game plan for our presentation tonight is I am going to give a little bit of the context of this
31   project and then turn it over to Jaime Rodriguez, our Chief Transportation Official, who will
32   provide you with a little background on the grant project and the traffic impact analysis and the
33   environmental review that we prepared, and then come back to me for the summary and next
34   steps in the process.

36   The California Avenue vision that we believe the Comprehensive Plan and other City policies
37   and documents points to is for a street that promotes pedestrian and bicycle safety, that
38   compliments the adjacent land uses, businesses, residences, office, and retail commercial, and
39   provides for pedestrian and bicycle amenities along the sidewalk near those businesses. And, a
40   street that overall balances all modes of travel including transit and vehicular uses.
41
42   The Comprehensive Plan has policy language related to providing pedestrian connections in
43   many places in the city, but particularly in these Downtown and California Avenue commercial
44   areas, and encourages specifically walkability for the California Avenue area. It defines the area
45   as a land use designation that is called Transit Oriented Residential. That is defined as being
