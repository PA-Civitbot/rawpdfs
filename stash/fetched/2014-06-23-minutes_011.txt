MOTION PASSED for Agenda Item Number 23: 8-1 Scharff no

Council Member Holman thought the process for the System Application
Product (SAP) security system should go before the Policy and Services
Committee, then Council because it was significant and needed to be vetted.

Council Member Schmid added that there were questions regarding SAP and
it was good to know the expectations of the Council and the public upfront.

Council Member Scharff did not support Item 23.
