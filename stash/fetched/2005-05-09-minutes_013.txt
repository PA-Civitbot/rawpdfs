      owned parking lot behind the Post Office;
  4   Return to Council before Council vacation in August 2005, with a
      feasibility analysis of this option and which recommendation(s),
      which will include a funding plan; and
  5   City Auditor would review this project and provide comments and
      her assessment to the City Council.

Vice Mayor Kleinberg said there were numerous apartment buildings that
surrounded the potential site, and she was interested to know how staff
worked with adjoining neighbors to bring them into the exploratory
process.    Usage of the old Police Department site at City Hall could
become beneficial to the community in accessing City services. She
asked whether the new Police Building would house an up-to-date, state-
of-the-art 9-1-1 Operations Center.

Ms. Harrison said it was part of what was being looked at. She said
grant funding was not available for constructing a building, and to equip
a building was very competitive for that type of grant funding. Grant
funding would be explored.

Vice Mayor Kleinberg supported the motion.

Council Member Freeman asked that the process be open to the public to
allow other bidders the opportunity.

Council Member Beecham said the opportunity was open for the past ten
years and would not accept the amendment.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION: Council Member Freeman moved to include all
actions in the Colleagues Memo plus the addition of opening the process
to allow other bidders the opportunity.

MOTION DIED FOR LACK OF A SECOND

Council Member Morton said he supported the motion based on the
statement that it was an exploration and not a policy decision to make
the Police Building a top priority in the CIP projects.

Mayor Burch supported the motion.

MOTION PASSED 8-1, Freeman no.
