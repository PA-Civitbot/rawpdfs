                                 MINUTES
Mr. Tanczos replied yes.

Council Member Shepherd inquired about the height of flagless flag poles.

Mr. Tanczos reported the flag poles in the photo simulation were 105 feet
tall.

Council Member Shepherd asked if the mono poles were the tallest towers.

Mr. Tanczos indicated the mono pole was also 105 feet. A self-support
tower was the only tower that could reach a height of 280 feet.

Council Member Shepherd inquired if he had a picture of the self-support
tower.

Mr. Tanczos responded no. The slide was illustrative of what could be
achieved with that size tower.

Council Member Shepherd inquired if there was a reason not to install three
flag poles rather than one mono pole at substations.

Mr. Tanczos indicated aesthetics would be the consideration. The two
flagless flag poles would provide similar technological flexibility as the single
mono pole.

Council Member Shepherd asked whether the substations had room for more
than one pole.

Mr. Williams reported Staff would need to review those types of issues to
determine what could be done at each site.

Council Member Shepherd felt the community wanted this type of
technology.    This would add infrastructure to the community without
increasing costs.

Council Member Klein believed the community would not support the use of
250-foot towers.

Mr. Tanczos stated his company would not bring that proposal forward.

Council Member Klein inquired if any other cities had implemented the
hybrid solution.
