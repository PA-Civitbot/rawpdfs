Council Member Mossar expressed her concern by the wording “strive to
maintain”.

Mr. Roberts stated the issue was there was not a specific site design and
was just a concept.

Council Member Mossar stated that any materials that disappear from the
recycling center that have a water quality toxicity component would be a
huge mistake.

Council Member Kleinberg asked whether the access road could be made
with a permeable naturally degrading substance.

Mr. Roberts stated no that when dealing with vehicles of this weight required
more durable substance.

Council Member Kleinberg asked how the City could get the community to
recycle.

Mr. Roberts stated that was part of the next item on the agenda regarding
the Scope of Services for the Request for Proposals (RFP) for the collection
and hauling contract where the new Zero Waste program elements were
being recommended as part of the Scope of Services.

Council Member Kleinberg asked whether the size and layout of the
Recycling Center proposal would accommodate a drop off service.

Mr. Roberts stated this site would be too small for a significant expansion of
a drop off. However, the new collection contract would contain added
programs at curbside.

Council Member Kleinberg asked whether some of the P&TC could review the
2007 Hargreaves Report and return it to the Council with recommendations.

Mr. Roberts stated the Report was already asked to go to the P&TC.

Council Member Kleinberg stated she only wanted to clarify that the entire
report was open for review.

MOTION:      Council Member Beecham moved, seconded by Mossar, to
approve staff recommendation to:
     1. Significantly reduce the size and scope of the current Recycling
          Center facility;
     2. Proceed with the relocation of landfill entrance, offices, truck
          scale, and toll booth;
     3. Make minor revisions to the State-approved landfill grading plan
