changes and interpretations Staff are making. I don't mean to say this
negatively about Staff, because I actually don't believe this to be true. If we
perceive Staff to be running amok and making changes and stuff that we
disagree with, at that point I'd actually put it on Tier 2 and say let's look at a
better process. This is clearly a better process than what we have now.
Let's not makeâ€”what's the old saying? Let's not make the perfect the
enemy of the good. That's the perfect saying. I think this is good. I think

Council Member Wolbach: I see it on page 6 right in the middle.

Mayor Holman: I'm looking for the building envelope language that Staff

Mr. Lait: Mayor, that might be in 18.18, a further chapter. A group ...
