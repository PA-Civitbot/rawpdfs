Mr. Keene stated in addition to having an oversight consultant look at the
technical software, Council Member Klein was asking if the City Attorney
would be able to bring in a legal expert to review the legality of performance
standards within the contract being discussed tonight.

Mr. Baum stated this action would require an outside consultant, and
additional time to rewrite the contract.

Council Member Klein stated that was what he had in mind.

Mayor Drekmeier inquired whether the Substitute Motion directed the City
Manager to retain an outside consultant to evaluate the SAP system
installation.

Council Member Klein stated yes.

Vice Mayor Morton stated it would take over $100,000 for legal review of the
contract from outside counsel. It was his belief that the Substitute Motion
stated to hire a software engineer to concurrently evaluate the system as
developed with the current problems, it did not include hiring an attorney to
provide legal review of the contract.

Mr. Keene answered yes.

Council Member Klein stated he wanted to include in the Substitute Motion to
direct the City Attorney to contract with an outside attorney to provide legal
review of the contract.

Vice Mayor Morton stated he would not accept that due to the prohibitive
cost involved.

INCORPORATED INTO THE SUBSTITUTE MOTION WITH THE
CONSENT OF THE MAKER AND SECONDER to direct the City Attorney to
contract with an outside attorney to provide legal review of the contract, the
cost of which is not to exceed $10,000.

Vice Mayor Morton stated he would accept the legal review of the contract if
it was less than $10,000.

Mr. Baum stated $10,000 would not be a large enough amount to provide a
competent performance-based analysis legal review of the SAP contract. He
indicated $50,000 may be feasible.

Council Member Klein stated $50,000 was too much money.
