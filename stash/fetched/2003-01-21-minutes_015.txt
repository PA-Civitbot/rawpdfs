     Âƒ     The City Council resolves that resolution of the playing fields
           problem is a Council priority, which is covered by current Council
           priorities.

Council Member Kleinberg clarified AFAC's recommendation whereby the City
Council resolved the resolution of the playing fields problem as a Council
priority, was brought to staff, and it was determined the athletic fields
renovation and expansion was within the Council's existing infrastructure
priorities. If the recommendations passed as worded, it would not require a
re vote on the Council's priorities.

Council Member Burch said he was impressed with the thoroughness and
hard work of the AFAC.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to direct staff to take the Phase I Action Plan to
the Finance Committee to identify funding and then to the Planning and
Transportation Commission.

Mayor Mossar asked whether there were funds in the budget to develop the
Phase I Action Plan or did the Finance Committee need to identify funding to
develop it.

City Manager Frank Benest suggested bringing the matter to the Finance
Committee in March 2003 to determine estimated costs for the Phase I
Action Plan.

Mayor Mossar said it would make better sense not to take the Action Plan to
the Finance Committee, but take the notion of creating an Action Plan to the
Finance Committee.

Mr. Benest said he would like to direct staff to determine initial steps and
cost estimates and then bring the issue to the Council and the Finance
Committee for input given the City's present situation.

Mayor Mossar asked if the City Manager's comments were consistent with
the understanding of the maker, the seconder, and the suggestor of the
motion.
Council Member Beecham said that was what he meant to say.

Council Member Morton complimented the members of the AFAC for all their
hard work and looked forward to their continued participation. He solicited
the help of the PARC because the City had two related entities, Stanford and
the PAUSD, who also needed to be persuaded to put an equal amount of
energy into the project.
