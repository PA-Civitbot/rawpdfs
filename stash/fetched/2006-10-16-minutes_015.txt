Council Member Drekmeier asked how Fry’s had approached the City on
signage enlargement.

Mayor Kleinberg asked what dimensions Fry’s had specified for signage.

Council Member Beecham recommended increasing the signage to 65 square
feet.

Mr. Emslie said signage was desired by Fry’s due to lack of frontage on a
major arterial street.

Mayor Kleinberg asked where the 65 square feet signage size originated.

together was approximately 65 square feet.

request larger signage along El Camino Real.

Mr. Williams said locations requesting larger signage were required to be
over 10 acres in size with over 50,000 square feet of retail.
