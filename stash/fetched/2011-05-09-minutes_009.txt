seconded by Council Member Scharff to: 1) approve the recommendation for
$25,500, to include the $1,500 deduction for early completion, 2) not
include the mid-year review or the modified 360 evaluation, and 3) continue
those two items to a date when all Council Members are available.

Council Member Shepherd asked for verification that the $1,500 discount
would still be received for early completion of the evaluations.

the decision.
