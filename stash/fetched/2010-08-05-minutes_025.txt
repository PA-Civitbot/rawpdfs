Council Member Holman raised concern regarding limiting the study to only
an AD system. She said other alternatives were given a cursory look
without consideration from a consultant. The Motion on April 5th did indicate
other options and not limited to an AD system.

Mr. Bobel confirmed Council’s direction on April 5th was to hire a consultant
to look at AD systems.

Council Member Holman asked to see a timeframe for the landfill closure and
rebuilding of the park with costs. She supported the Motion.

Council Member Schmid said the City of Santa Barbara was exploring the
possibilities in obtaining new energy. He suggested tracking Santa Barbara’s
experience to see where they will be in two years.

Mr. Bobel said Staff was tracking three different technologies the City of Los
Angeles had chosen. One was AD and the other two were of high heat
technology.

MOTION PASSED: 5-2 Holman, Schmid no, Espinosa, Yeh absent

MOTION: Council Member Scharff moved, seconded by Council Member
Shepherd for Staff to return in October 2010 with a first cut analysis of
Refuse Fund costs, closure and rent, and a final cut by January 24, 2011
with a report on a timeframe for closing of the landfill and rebuilding of the
park with costs.

Council Member Scharff said it was important to look at the big picture in
moving forward with the AD process and what was being done with the
Refuse Fund, the closure and rent. Staff should be given clear policy
direction in a cost-effective way.

MOTION PASSED: 7-0 Espinosa, Yeh absent

Council Member Holman noted the “at place” memorandum indicated
$49,000 would be used for the Study.

Mr. Bobel said it was necessary to make that change making it consistent
with the Utilities Advisory Commission (UAC) recommendation.

Council Member Scharff asked how much money was in the Calaveras
Reserve.

Utilities Director, Val Fong said in the magnitude of $60 Million.
