   •   perform an environmental review, including fulfilling California Environmental Quality
       Act (CEQA) requirements and public outreach;
   •   prepare construction plans and specifications for the first phase from Alma to
       Middlefield;
   •   provide construction administration services for the first phase of construction of San
       Antonio Road medians from Alma Street to Middlefield Road.

Associated street maintenance repair and resurfacing work will be done as part of the Annual
Street Maintenance Program as it is a priority in the City’s Pavement Maintenance and
Management System. Similarly, the second phase of construction on San Antonio Road from
Middlefield Road to Highway 101 would be a jointly coordinated project over the next few
years, pending available funds.

The project design will include “green” elements such as incorporating water conserving
landscaping and sustainable irrigation technology. Replacement of the tree canopy with
selections which can better adapt to the existing soil and improvements to the existing planting
conditions within the medians are essential to the success of the project and will be addressed
during design. Exhibit A includes the complete Scope of Services for the project.

A Request for Proposals (RFP) for the project was posted at City Hall, on the City website and
mailed to 16 firms on September 20, 2005. The table summarizes the results of the RFP
solicitation.
