Council Member Schmid asked if the preschool drop-off and pick-up traffic
was going to be substantial enough to effect the Baylands Trails.

Mr. Dorman stated the trail comes near and around the site, but the site is
heavily wooded.

Council Member Schmid stated at this point you can see the parking lot from
the trail.
Mr. Dorman stated across the site, the traffic analysis was 40 trips beyond
what the current trips are, and that the parking lot size has been reduced by
at least 40 cars.

Council Member Schmid noted his concerns about turn-around traffic which
is twice a day, drop-off and pick-up and quite a number of trips.

Mr. Dorman stated the turn-around is functional with plenty of drop-off
parking spaces, decreasing the number of cars using the turnaround.

Council Member Schmid asked staff to address concerns over the noise
issues that may arise from the heavy equipment used at the Los Altos
Treatment Plant (LATP).

Mr. Williams stated there was enough separation in the plan to ameliorate
those issues, along with screening along the property, to minimize the
concerns over the noise effects on the school children.

Council Member Schmid asked if the applicant is in agreement with this
statement.

Mr. Williams stated the applicant is aware of the wide range of uses on that
site.

Council Member Morton asked if the composting site is going to be sound-
proofed enough that it will not affect the daycare site.

Mr. Williams stated they are looking at what they are doing on their site as
well to lessen these effects.

Council Member Morton stated they may have mitigation measures as well in
their approval of this project.

Mr. Williams stated this to be true, but it should not prohibit the uses on
their site, and they would need to look at measures to help with the sound-
proofing and additional screening.
