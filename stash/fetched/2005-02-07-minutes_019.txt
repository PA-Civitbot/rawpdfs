4.   Colleagues Memo from Mayor Burch and Council Member Freeman re:
     Police Review Body

Mayor Burch read into the record the Colleague’s memo authored by Council
Member Freeman and himself.

Council Member Freeman said the intent of the memo was to allow
discussion on the topic. She felt it was a good idea to examine issues within
the Human Relation Commission (HRC). Approval of a Police Review Body
would allow the HRC to review, make comments, listen to the public, and
bring issues to Council for action.

Don Letcher, 788 North Rengstorff, Mountain View, said there was not a
place where Mountain View and Palo Alto citizens could go to complain about
inappropriate police actions and felt it was important to establish a review
board with power to discipline.

Mark Petersen-Perez wanted to see changes made in the Police Department.
An oversight commission entrusted with power to discipline officers would
help reduce corruption in the department.

Aram James spoke on the topic of police misconduct and expressed
disagreement on how police oversight issues were handled by City staff. He
said an oversight commission could review Police Department policies that
could result in wrongful convictions.

Christiane Cook, 1234 Emerson, was not in favor of having a review board
under HRC’s jurisdiction. Through past experience, she had found the HRC
to be inadequate and faced long delays in resolving a problem.

Richard Shapiro spoke of his arrest for public disturbance and how the law in
Santa Clara County mistreated him.
