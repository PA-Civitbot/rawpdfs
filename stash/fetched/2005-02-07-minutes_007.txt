Manager on the accounts and funding once Council approved the budget.

Council Member Morton clarified it was a requirement that the City Manager
open a separate bank account and separate accounting.

Mr. Baum said that was correct, and expenditures could be focused on one
project.

Vice Mayor Kleinberg asked what the 47,834 figure represented at the
bottom of matrix (CMR:108:05 Attachment C) .

Mr. Emslie said it was the potential bonus square footage of everything on
the matrix including previously rehabilitated buildings.

Vice Mayor Kleinberg questioned why the large difference between 47,834
and 80,668.

Senior Planner Virginia Warheit clarified the figures included all buildings
eligible for both historic and seismic bonuses.

Vice Mayor Kleinberg clarified that approximately 80,000 square feet of
public buildings were eligible for potential development in the Downtown
area.

Mr. Emslie said that was correct.

Vice Mayor Kleinberg asked whether any private buildings were eligible in
terms of square footage and TDRs.

Mr. Emslie said the program applied to private buildings, but he did not
know the approximate footage.

Vice Mayor Kleinberg said she was not concerned about the actual footage
but wanted to get a sense of eligible private footage because: 1) there was
not a sense of potential build out in the Downtown area; and 2) if developers
wanted to make commercial office buildings, there was over 80,000 square
