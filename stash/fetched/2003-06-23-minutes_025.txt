Council Member Lytle asked why Cubberley would not be kept on the list.

Mr. James said all the fields on the list were being kept.    Those projects
were being looked at first.

Council Member Lytle said the CIP was just to add the potential, not to track
any others.

Council Member Freeman said she understood there would be a public
discussion on Greer Park.

Ms. Harrison said all the parks had issues.

Vice Mayor Beecham said the issue that evening was to add Mayfield to the
top of the priority list.

Council Member Lytle asked if moving Mayfield to the top de-prioritized
Greer.

Mr. James said it was staff’s intention to move forward on the Mayfield and
Greer projects at the same time.

MOTION PASSED 7-0, Kleinberg, Mossar “not participating.”

18. City Clerk’s Report re: Fluoridating Palo Alto Public Drinking Water
Issue: Report from City Attorney on Legal Issues Associated with Initiative
(Item continued from June 2, 2003

City Attorney Ariel Calonne said a legal analysis showed a number of areas
where State law superceded any attempt to implement a local law. He did
not believe any of those areas would keep the initiative off the ballot.
Repealing the City’s 1954 Initiative was lawful.

Juri Vilms, 1330 Harker Avenue, said he felt it was important to put the
Initiative on the ballot in November. The City Attorney referred to the
Health and Safety Code, which clearly expressed the intent of the State to
have pure water as one of the overriding requirements.

Jeff Green, Citizens for Safe Drinking Water, 1010 University Avenue, #52,
San Diego, said no community had been compelled by the State to
fluoridate.

Billie Barewald, 321 Sleeper Avenue, Mountain View, said the public would
have the opportunity to find out about the harmful effects of fluoridation and
fluoride.
