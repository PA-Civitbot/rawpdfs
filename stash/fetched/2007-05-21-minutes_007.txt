     Amending the Palo Alto Municipal Code, Title 16 (Building
     Regulations) by Adding Chapter 16.59 - Citywide
     Transportation Impact Fee.

City Attorney Gary Baum said three Council Members were conflicted
with items related to Stanford and, therefore, Item No 11 would be split
into two items. The full Council could participate in the Transportation
Impact Fee with the exception of the Stanford-owned lands. The second
portion would be Stanford only. The Stanford conflicted members would
declare their conflict and leave the dais and then the Stanford-related
Transportation Impact Fee and any related issues could be considered
by the remaining Council Members.

Planning Administrator Jon Abendschein provided a presentation as
outlined in staff reports CMR:247:07 and CMR:181:07.

Vice Mayor Klein asked how many projects were in the pipeline over the
size of 100,000 square feet.

Mr. Abendschein said he was not aware of any projects that had
submitted an application. The Stanford Shopping Center and Medical
Center projects were the only possibilities prior to the exemption
expiring.

Mr. Baum said that would be discussed in the second portion of the
hearing.

Vice Mayor Klein asked why there was concern if no projects met the
qualifications.

Mr. Baum said it was due to the separation of the item.

Director of Planning and Community Environment Steve Emslie said it
was due to a longer period of time in adopting impact fees. Instead of
the usual two readings with a 30-day period, it was 60 days with a
longer window, and applications could be submitted.

Vice Mayor Klein asked whether consideration was given regarding all
applications being due retroactive to May 21, 2007.

Mr. Emslie said staffâ€™s recommendation was to utilize the same adoption
methodology used in 2001-2002 and honor applications in process
during the time of adopting the impact fees.
