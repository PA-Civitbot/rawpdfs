Mr. Keene stated that report would be in June 2009.

Council Member Yeh inquired whether the Calaveras Fund Reserve was being
looked at as a potential funding source for fiber-to-the-premises by the
Utilities Advisory Commission (UAC).

Utilities Director, Valerie Fong stated a clear conclusion had not been drawn
between the fiber-to-the-premises and benefits to the electric ratepayer.
She stated Staff was currently working on funding studies and a smart grid
proposal to be reviewed by the UAC.

Council Member Yeh inquired how Staff defined “more risky”, as noted in the
Staff report.

Mr. Saccio stated fiber-to-the-premises was a “more risky” venture because
it was dependent on the revenue streams from the market. He stated the
revenue stream was not guaranteed due to competition with other vendors.
