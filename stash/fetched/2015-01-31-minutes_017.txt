Many elements of the Comprehensive Plan were outside the built
environment, and many components of the built environment were outside
the Comprehensive Plan.

Mayor Holman remarked that the Council attempted to narrow Priorities to
three, but there was no dictate to limit the number to three. She inquired
whether more than three Priorities would impact workload.

Mr. Keene advised that the Council adopted language stating a goal of no
more than three Priorities.

Mayor Holman suggested taking a straw poll regarding the number of
Priorities.

MOTION: Council Member DuBois moved, seconded by Council Member
Kniss to adopt all five priorities.

Council Member Kniss felt all were Priorities, but each had a different weight.

Council Member Burt recalled in past years the Council decided to vote on
each Priority individually.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION: Council Member Burt moved, seconded by Council
Member Scharff to go through Priority Numbers 2 through 5 individually and
vote on each.

Council Member Burt asked whether there should be a straw poll or a
binding poll.

Mayor Holman suggested a straw poll.

Council Member Scharff felt choosing all five had a built-in bias. The Council
should make choices.

Council Member Filseth asked how he should vote if he supported all five
Priorities but felt only three should be prioritized.

Mayor Holman advised that his vote should demonstrate that.

Council Member Burt indicated his Substitute Motion did not direct a straw
poll or a binding poll.

MOTION FOR INFRASTRUCTURE PASSED: 7-2 Schmid, DuBois no

MOTION FOR HEALTHY CITY PASSED: 6-3 Scharff, Filseth, Burt no
