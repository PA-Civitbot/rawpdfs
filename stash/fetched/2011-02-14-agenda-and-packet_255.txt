                                                                                                             10.d




 1   these improvements. We thought what can we do. We had some very simple ideas as far as
 2   working with the search engines such as Yahoo, such as Google, to set up banners so that if you
 3   were to do a search within our community much like you would do today you would have a pop
 4   up specific to Palo Alto to say come visit California Avenue. Something that promotes in simple




                                                                                                                    Attachment: Attachment D: P&TC Excerpt Minutes of January 12, 2011 (1320 : California Avenue Neg Dec and CIP)
 5   ways people to visit our community and promote some of the improvements that we built into
 6   the street. So that is just some of the things that we talked about that we definitely want to
 7   pursue and develop further as this project moves forward.

 9   Commissioner Tanaka: Okay. Jaime, in your opinion is there a possibility to do a trial?
10
11   Mr. Rodriguez: I think it would not be a well-developed trial. I am just being honest. I will use
12   the example of Arastradero for better or worse. That trial was done in the right way. The slurry
13   seal that happened with that particular street covered up any of the old markings that were there,
14   provided a fresh clean look to the street. That is something that can’t be done today because
15   California Avenue needs to be resurfaced. That is something that the merchants have said, the
16   residents have said. That actually is a true statement. Much of California Avenue has
17   completely failed as far as the pavement goes. We are very fortunate that this grant will actually
18   cover a majority of that resurfacing cost for us by converting those existing asphalt parking bays
19   to concrete decorative bays that will have much more longevity life than we would get out of
20   asphalt. So if it is implemented today not having had those other improvements in place it may
21   not be a good comparison as to what it would look like in the future with the improvements that
22   are proposed.
23
24   I am going to ask Bret if he is familiar with any type of an improvement like this done as a trial
25   anywhere else. I can’t think of a one.
26
27   Commissioner Tanaka: Okay, I understand. So you mentioned we have the amount to repave.
28   How would it have cost to repave the whole street?
29
30   Mr. Rodriguez: I didn’t pull the specific up, I am just going off experience. Just looking at
31   California Avenue today if it was going to get resurfaced at about 60-plus feet wide curb-to-curb,
32   from El Camino down to the Caltrain station I would estimate about $1.2 to $1.4 million. What
33   it will cost us now with just a 30-foot section down the street I would probably guess more
34   around $500,000 to $600,000. A significant difference.
35
36   Commissioner Tanaka: Okay, so with the reduced asphalt then every ten years or whatever, 20
37   years, we are going to save an additional half a million dollars.
38
39   Mr. Rodriguez: That is right.
40
41   Commissioner Tanaka: Okay.
42
43   Chair Tuma: Commissioner Tanaka, we are going to get to a motion. People will have an
44   opportunity to speak to the motion. We do again need to try to respect everybody’s time. So I
45   am going to ask that unless there is something of critical urgency that we move on.
