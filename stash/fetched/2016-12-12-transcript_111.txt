                         TRANSCRIPT
    ii.    Decreasing the Non-Departmental City Council Contingency
           appropriation in the amount of $15,000.

Mayor Burt: Did you want to speak further to your Motion?

Council Member Holman: Just one other quick thank you to City Attorney
Molly Stump for lining out all the various mechanisms that have to be put in
place for this to happen. The other is that we got one email about the
expenditure of funds. This is the Council Contingency Funds, which we
almost never, ever touch. It couldn't happen for a better reason.

Mayor Burt: Council Member Kniss.

Council Member Kniss: I would only say it was great fun to hear Sweetly
Sings the Donkey. Thank you all for being here.

Mayor Burt: Council Member DuBois.

Council Member DuBois: I just want to thank all the volunteers who take
care of the donkey and who went through all the turmoil recently in dealing
with Niner and also finding the new donkey. Thank you, guys, for all that
effort.

Mayor Burt: I would just like to echo appreciation for all the handlers, for
Acterra in their role as a fiscal agent and letting us have some nonprofit
legal vehicle to handle the funds, to James Witt who provides vital pasture—
without that, we wouldn't have a location for the donkeys—and for the
broader Barron Park neighbors and everyone else in the community who
value and help support them. Let us "bray" that this will be enough. Please
vote.

Mr. Keene: His last words.

MOTION PASSED: 8-0

Mayor Burt: Thank you all.    Unless you want to hang around for our last
Council Member Comments.
