the core retail locations. We can support our embryonic retail uses. Another
thing that causes me to still support that same position is since the last
meeting and this one, I actually encountered someone that I actually happen
to know to some extent, who actually as a retail use had tried to rent that
space. They were offered a very high price for rent. It's not that nobody in
retail wants to rent those spaces.

Mayor Burt: Council Member Schmid.

Council Member Schmid: I'm a little skeptical of this. Just before the retail
Ordinance comes to us, we are granting a waiver for educational purposes.
Maybe it turns out to be code training. That then becomes a permanent
waiver when the new retail Ordinance comes out in three or four months.
One of our goals with this area is to do mixed use. It's a good area for
denser housing. To grant a permanent waiver in the short term before we
have our full retail Ordinance doesn't seem to make sense.

Mayor Burt: Council Member DuBois.

Council Member DuBois: I agree with almost everything Council Member
Holman said. I feel like this is spot zoning. I haven't changed my mind
since we discussed it before either. I won't be supporting the Motion.

Mayor Burt: Let's vote on the board.       That passes on a 5-4 vote with
Council Members Schmidâ€”I'm sorry.

Council Member DuBois: (inaudible)

Ms. Gitelman: As an urgency Ordinance, it requires a supermajority. I think
it's seven votes.

MOTION FAILED: 5-4 DuBois, Filseth, Holman, Schmid, no

James Keene, City Manager: Aren't we coming back with what you guys
asked us to come back with quickly?

Council Member Wolbach: On Page 2, it says requires eight votes.

Ms. Gitelman: Council Members, the Motion fails as an Urgency Ordinance.
We can take it to the Planning Commission and bring it back to you in some
more time as a non-urgency Ordinance. Although, we'll have to look at that
to be sure we can amend an Urgency Ordinance that way.

Mayor Burt: When would the permanent Ordinance be considered?
