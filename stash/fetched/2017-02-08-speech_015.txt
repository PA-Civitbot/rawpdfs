become seniors. Avenidas is raising $13 million dollars to completely renovate the City

owned building and the City is dedicating $5 million dollars to the project. We are very

lucky to live in a community where projects like this can become a reality.




The second partnership is with the Friends of the Palo Alto Junior Museum & Zoo who

will complete their $25 million dollar fundraising campaign to rebuild the JMZ facility as

a gift to the community. The campaign includes a $15 million matching grant from the

Peery Foundation and $10 million in private donations from local donors. Again, this is

an extraordinary partnership between our citizens and the city of which we can be very

proud.




Palo Alto's Junior Museum & Zoo has 170,000 visitors per year and offers a robust

science education outreach program that served 19,000 local schoolchildren last year in

nearly 50 elementary schools and preschools, including all 12 PAUSD elementary

schools. Palo Alto's Art Center had over 108,000 visitors last year, including more than

24,000 visitors to its galleries. The JMZ collaborated with the Art Center to provide a

two-year artist-in-residency program called Creative Ecology. The program includes

field trips and programs for schools, weekend family programs in local open spaces and

parks, and gallery programs highlighting the work of the four artists with schools and

families. Creative Ecology served approximately 9,400 people this year â€“ that is

outstanding!
