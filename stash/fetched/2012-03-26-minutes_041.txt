Council Member Burt asked whether IBRC had discussed a $50 amount or
whether Staff was talking $1 million per $50 increment.

Mr. Saccio did not recall what amount IBRC may have discussed.              He
recalled that was at the bottom of IBRC's recommendations.

Council Member Burt stated it was $1 million for each $50 increment.

Mr. Saccio replied correct.

Council Member Holman asked what were the TOT rates for San Francisco
and San Jose.

Mr. Keene thought it was the same as Palo Alto.

Council Member Holman inquired if San Jose was 12 percent.

Mr. Perez thought San Jose was the same, but San Francisco was higher,
possibly at 12 or 15 percent.

Mr. Saccio reported San Jose was listed at 10 percent.

Council Member Holman reiterated San Jose was 10 percent and San
Francisco was between 12 percent and 15 percent.

Mr. Keene suggested it was at least 14 percent based on his recollection.

Ms. Stump stated California City Finance reported San Francisco's TOT was
14 percent.

Council Member Holman was curious about the structure of the transfer tax.
She noted the percentages for Palo Alto and Mountain View were
considerably different than percentages for Sunnyvale, Menlo Park and
Redwood City. She inquired why there was such a discrepancy, and if there
was any constraint to what the Council might do.

Mr. Saccio reported each city established its own rate and the County had a
rate of $1.10, which applied throughout the County, but each city
determined its own rate. He stated Palo Alto's was higher than some of the
other jurisdictions. He noted Palo Alto and Mountain View had the same
rate, while Sunnyvale and Redwood City's rates were slightly lower. He
explained a prior discussion of changing the documentary transfer tax
resulted in significant opposition from realtors. He indicated that was a
constraint for that tax.
