Council Member Ojakian said the reduction in lanes could be phased in.

Mr. Emslie said it would be considered, but the entire corridor needed to
function as a unit. Funding constraints would make it necessary to be
completed in segments.

Council Member Ojakian said the funding for the sidewalk and street portion
could come from monies reserved for that purpose from Public Works.

Mr. Emslie said a large part of the trail, combined with Public Works
resurfacing, would be covered with already committed Capital Funds.

Council Member Ojakian said traffic traveled between 35-40mph in the
Corridor. Radar was the most effective enforcement tool available, but
required a survey.

Mr. Emslie said the residing State law set standards for speed limits.

Council Member Ojakian said results would be reviewed as changes were
implemented and adjustments would be made. Engineering techniques
would have to be the solution for safety.

Vice Mayor Burch said he believed the plan envisioned having streets that
would be safe for children and bikes.

Council Member Kishimoto questioned the phasing of the project. Currently,
the only grant was for $1.2 million for the adaptive traffic signal control,
which was for the capacity-increasing portion of the balance and integrated
plan.

Mr. Emslie said the capacity existed through the signals upgrade, which was
already funded, to provide the capacity necessary for the trial project
immediately.

Chief Transportation Officer Joe Kott said traffic adaptives were considered
capacity increasing.

Council Member Kishimoto asked if the planned phasing was approved.

Mr. Emslie said the plan concentrated on the concept design; the phasing
would be developed. If needed, staff would report to Council during the
phasing.

Council Member Kishimoto suggested combining components two and three
of the report. Component two was automation of the traffic signals through
