6a.   (Former No. 6) Approval of a Final Map to Subdivide Three Lots into
      Separate Parcels and Approval of Community Room Use Agreement at
      3401, 3415, 3445 Alma Street (Alma Plaza).

Council Member Kishimoto asked whether the Covenants, Conditions, and
Restrictions (CC&R) for the 37 single-family residents had been reviewed
prior to approving the Final Map. The CC&R required owners to maintain
private garages to ensure two cars could be parked inside at all times.

Interim Director of Planning, Curtis Williams confirmed the CC&R had been
reviewed by the Planning Director and the City Attorney.

Council Member Kishimoto asked whether the CC&R was drafted and
presented to the Council.

Mr. Williams said the CC&Rs are not brought before the Council. They are
approved by the Planning Director and the City Attorney.

Council Member Kishimoto asked whether the subdivision improvement
agreement had been finalized and signed prior to approval of the Final Map.

Mr. Williams confirmed it had been reviewed and approved by the Public
Works Director and the City Attorney.

Council Member Kishimoto asked the City Attorney to clarify vesting of the
project.

City Attorney, Gary Baum said the condition of approval and the vesting
rights occurred at the time when the tentative subdivision map was passed.
The City was governed by the Subdivision Map Act which stated a Final Map
must be approved as long as it substantially complied with the conditions of
the Tentative Map.      The City Attorney and Staff had determined that
threshold had been met.

Council Member Kishimoto asked if the back parcel had been vested.
