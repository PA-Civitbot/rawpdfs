be added. The suggestion was made to include Ole’s into RT-50, which
helped to increase the potential for housing.

Vice Mayor Beecham said the Council was in agreement on all the
items except for 744 and 790 High Street.

Virginia Warheit said the small parcel on the map was used as a
garden for the building next door.

Council Member Freeman referenced the map in Attachment B.5 of
CMR:386:03.

Vice Mayor Beecham said the section, 790 High Street, was on a
category 3, and 744 was eligible or potential California register
eligible.

AMENDMENT: Council Member Kishimoto, moved, seconded by Lytle,
to delete parcels 744 and 790 from RT-50 to become RT-35.

Council Member Freeman said she believed that the corridor along
Homer Avenue should remain RT-35, in keeping with the Comp Plan
policy of mid-block changes of zoning.

Council Member Lytle was uncomfortable redesignating a public facility
parcel into housing, when the Council had not received staff’s report
on the status of the public facility land and whether the Council could
afford to surplus any of the land.

Council Member Freeman asked whether the Council came to the
conclusion that there was no resolution on whether or not the Council
could determine if a PF parcel could be changed to anything but PF
without other investigations.

Ms. Furth said the Council designated in the Comp Plan for housing,
and she believed the Council could change the zoning. Steps were
required prior to disposing property.

Council Member Lytle said the Comp Plan Land Use Map was not
modified and continued to show the property as PF. The Housing
Element showed the site as one of the sites anticipated to be
developed for housing in the future.

Ms. Furth stated the Comp Plan was included the first time the item
went to the Council.
