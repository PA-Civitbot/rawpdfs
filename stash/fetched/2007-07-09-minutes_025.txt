Mayor Kishimoto supported the Motion.

Council Member Morton asked the amount the EV had been expecting from
the sale of the TDR.

Mr. Berkowitz said RV expected approximately $250,000.

Council Member Morton recommended a mechanism be put in place for the
Council to return to revisit the process.

City Attorney Gary Baum suggested a not to exceed $300,000 limit.

Council Member Morton asked to add the wording “without further Council
input.”

AMENDMENT TO THE INCORPORATION: Council Member Morton moved,
seconded by Klein, to allow Transfer Development Rights up to $300,000
with any additional amount over $300,000 subject to the approval of the
City Council.

AMENDMENT PASSED: 8-1, Drekmeier no.

Council Member Drekmeier asked whether the cap was set at $300,000.

Council Member Morton said no; if a higher amount was bid, the issue would
return to Council for consideration.

Mr. Yeats stated the TDR bidding process required the Council to approve
the actual sale of the TDR.

Council Member Drekmeier asked if the TDR was sold for less $250,000 what
would be the process.

Council Member Morton said the project retained the full amount.

Mr. Yeats said there was no specific amount mentioned in the negotiations.

MOTION AS AMENDED PASSED: 9-0.
