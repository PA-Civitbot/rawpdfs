"by the majority of active citizen advisors." Now, that sounds like less than
the CAC.

Council Member DuBois:      I think Council Member Scharff already deleted
that. It should be ...

Vice Mayor Schmid: If we could just say "majority of the CAC."

Mayor Holman: Council Member Burt, you're good with that?

Council Member Burt: Yes.

Vice Mayor Schmid: Second question, Number F. It talks about discussing a
co-build and how the City can lay its own conduit to the premise. Two
questions. Do we talk with Google before they've come back to us?

Council Member DuBois: That's the suggestion.

Vice Mayor Schmid: That's what?

Council Member DuBois: That's what I'm proposing.

Vice Mayor Schmid: Okay. In the goal we have already established that we
want City ownership of fiber assets. The co-build would beâ€”they would be
contractors. Do they want a contract? Are we implying that the City will lay
the last mile of fiber?

Council Member DuBois: We're implying that the City would lay fiber and
Google would also lay fiber. There would be City-owned fiber, and there
would be Google fiber. We would dig once and share the building costs.

Vice Mayor Schmid: The City owns the fiber infrastructure, is that right? Is
that what our goal is?

Council Member DuBois: Yes. We're not preventing Google from building
their own. Google would potentially build their own and cherry pick or offer
to the neighborhoods they wanted, but we would try to leverage that to lay
ours at the same time.

Vice Mayor Schmid: We would have ownership of the fiber infrastructure, is
that right? Is that the goal that we're setting out for?
