        Furthermore, EPA has long viewed SSIs as included within the CWA “treatment works” definition
through its implementation of the CWA Title II construction grant program. EPA consistently approved
funding for the construction or upgrade of incinerators through its Title II grant fund, which is specifically
limited to “treatment works” as defined above. NACWA has collected information from its members indicating
that many SSIs were constructed and/or upgraded using Title II funding. The following NACWA members
have confirmed that they received Title II “treatment works” funds to construct and/or upgrade SSIs:

    •   Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District, Cleveland, Ohio (all seven existing incinerators)
    •   Hampton Roads Sanitation District, Virginia Beach, Virginia
    •   Central Contra Costa Sanitary District, Martinez, California
    •   The Metropolitan District, Hartford, Connecticut
    •   The City of Greensboro Water Resources Department, Greensboro, North Carolina

       Indeed, it may well be the case that many or all of the 234 SSIs7 operated by municipalities in the US
were constructed or upgraded with CWA Title II construction grants. This would have been contrary to the
CWA, and EPA would have illegally approved the use of millions of dollars in grant funds, if the Agency did not
consider SSIs to be part of the “treatment works.”

  The Water Environment Research Foundation counted 234 active biosolids incineration units in its 2009 WERF Report at ES-1
(Attachment B). NACWA asks that EPA take the time to confirm the number of incinerators and that it include dormant incinerators
with active operating permits in the total number of SSIs considered for this rulemaking.
