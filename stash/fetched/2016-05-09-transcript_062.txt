Vice Mayor Scharff:     I guess I need to approve it, and Marc needs to
approve it.

Vice Mayor Scharff: I think I liked it better the way it was.

Mayor Burt:    It's basically the difference between whether Staff will
necessarily do some reduction of parking spaces or whether they will
evaluate whether to reduce.

Vice Mayor Scharff: I said no.

Council Member Berman: You said no.

Mayor Burt:    That is not accepted unless you want to attempt to have a
second.

Council Member Wolbach: I was hoping somebody might second it in that
case.

Council Member Berman:        I'll second it and hope there's not a lot of
discussion.

AMENDMENT:    Council Member Wolbach moved, seconded by Council
Member Berman to replace in the Motion Part C, “reduce” with “explore
reducing.”

Mayor Burt: Why don't we see if we can vote up or down on this minor
distinction. It is a distinction. The amendment is a difference to direct Staff
to explore reducing the parking spaces near Greer Park. I see people feel
obligated to speak to this. Council Member Schmid.

Council Member Schmid: (inaudible)

Mayor Burt: Council Member Filseth.

Council Member Filseth: (inaudible)

Mayor Burt: I'm going to clear the board. Vice Mayor Scharff, do you need
to speak to it? I've cleared the board. Once we vote on this, then you'll
need to hit your button again to get up. Let's vote on the amendment. That
fails on a 5-4 vote with Council Members Wolbach, Burt, Berman and Kniss
voting yes.

AMENDMENT FAILED: 4-5 Berman, Burt, Kniss, Wolbach yes
