Mr. Bobel reported there was not a good option for capping a significant
portion of the landfill while allowing the 10-acre site to be uncapped and
used. Garbage from the 10-acre area had to be placed somewhere. When
considering the details, Staff did not determine a good option for capping
part of the landfill.

Council Member Burt inquired whether some portion of the landfill could
remain uncapped such that 10 acres could be utilized for an ECF while
demonstrating the City's good faith effort to comply with regulations and the
community's mandate.

Mr. Bobel explained Staff could not find an area such as that.

Council Member Burt asked if capping a portion of the landfill would have
any bearing with the regulatory agency.

Mr. Bobel did not believe so, because the area would be small and in strange
locations.

Council Member Burt questioned the need for the RFP to state the City would
be responsible for the construction of a dewatering facility.

Mr. Bobel reported the dewatering facility was for biosolids only.

Council Member Burt asked if landfill gas from biosolids or from any of the
three energy streams would be free to the Regional Water Quality Control
Plant.

Mr. Bobel indicated page 603 referred to the current landfill gas. It was not
referring to the gas produced by the new facility.

Council Member Burt inquired whether a noise level of 75-80 dB was
permissible.

Mr. Bobel was unable to address the noise level at the current time.

Council Member Burt suggested one evaluation criteria should be the noise
level.

Mr. Bobel agreed. Noise level was already included in criteria.

Council Member Holman asked when the City Council and the public would
know the financial impacts of costs borne by the City as stated in the RFP,
and how were those costs determined.
