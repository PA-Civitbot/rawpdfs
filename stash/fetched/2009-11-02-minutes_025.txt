Council Member Yeh stated this was an exciting initiative with two countries
who were the largest carbon admitters in the world. He stated there had
been six cities selected within China and six cities and regions proposed
within the United States. He stated there had been discussions of getting
Palo Alto engaged as one of the six cities stemming from the connection with
Stanford University.

MOTION: Council Member Yeh moved, seconded by Council Member Burt
to pass a Resolution accepting an invitation to participate in the United
States-China Low-Carbon Cities, Communities, and Regions Program.

Council Member Burt stated the participation of the program was a very
important economic element as Palo Alto emerged as a recognized leader for
a business investment in clean technology.

Council Member Espinosa asked the amount of resource impact on travel,
budgets or Staff time.

Council Member Yeh stated in addition to foundation funding there had been
private investors identified for funding and Staff time would be at a
minimum.

Council Member Espinosa noted if Palo Alto was selected to participate it
would be a benefit to share the honor with the Washington, DC lobbyist
team.

Council Member Kishimoto stated the participation would solidify Palo Altoâ€™s
role as a gateway between the U.S. and China.

MOTION PASSED: 8-0 Morton absent
