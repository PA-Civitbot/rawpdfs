                                                                                                               a

                        b) Oral Communications and Public Comments. Oral
                        communications and public comments will be listed together on the
                        agenda and heard at the end of the study session. If a meeting follows
                        the study session, public comments will be heard at the end of any
                        Council discussion, but oral communications will be consolidated
                        with the oral communications section of the following meeting.

                        c) No Formal Rules. Study sessions are intended to be conducive to
                        in-depth factual presentations by City staff and detailed questioning
                        and brainstorming by Council. The Council may discuss the material
                        freely without following formal rules of parliamentary procedure.
                        However, the general rules of decorum apply.

                        d) No Final Action. Staff may be directed to bring matters back for




                                                                                                                   Attachment: 2.15.11 (1422 : Policy and Services Agenda 2/15/2011)
                        Council consideration at future meetings, but no final action can be
                        taken.

                4. Closed Sessions. Closed sessions are the only kind of Council meeting
                that the public cannot observe. State law allows closed sessions to discuss
                pending litigation, employment issues, real estate negotiations and certain
                other matters. To the greatest extent possible, the City Attorney and City
                Clerk shall use standardized agenda descriptions that are consistent with
                Government Code section 54954.5.

                        a) Announcements before Closed Sessions. The mayor shall
                        announce the item or items to be considered in closed session by
                        reference to the appropriate agenda number or letter, or in an
                        alternate form that shall be provided by the City Attorney.



                        b) Public Comments. Members of the public are permitted to make
                        public comments on closed session matters. The City Clerk shall be
                        present in the open session to record Council attendance and any
                        statements made during oral communications or by the Council.

                        c) Attendance. The City Manager and City Attorney, or their
                        designees, shall attend closed sessions unless it is necessary to
                        excuse them. Only such additional staff shall attend as are necessary
                        and then only if the legal privileges of confidentiality obtained in an
                        executive session are not waived.

                              d) Public Reports. State Law and a Palo Alto initiative require the
                              Council to make a public report after a closed session when certain
                              kinds of actions are taken.vii Reports from closed sessions shall be
                              made by the Mayor, the Vice Mayor in the Mayor's absence, or such
