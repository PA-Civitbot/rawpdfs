Slide        Caltrain




Slide 65.5

As we look at a variety of ways to address our parking and traffic issues, each aspect is
just that: one piece of the potential solutions puzzle. This has to be a multi-pronged
approach.

One piece is our expanded bicycle facilities that now extend to 65.5 miles. This,
along with Caltrain, Traffic Demand Management programs and Transportation
Management Association creation, VTA, expanded shuttles and bicycle facilities…it’s
going to take everything that we have and can conceive of and more to address the
issues. This is the price of success.

Slide 836

Thanks to the efforts of people such as Penny Ellson and Kathy Durham along with
support and promotion by our schools, the most recent count of students who bike to
school at Gunn High School was 836 and at Palo Alto High School was 805. The
schools, through programs such as Walk and Roll, have been remarkable in helping to
curb traffic and parking concerns, to get people out of cars and choose healthier
alternatives to driving.
