and then actions. We're not close to actions yet. We've got to be clear on
what the principles are. I won't try to, by any means, recount Council
Members' comments. I think and hope that you've gotten enough query this
evening that you have enough information to come back with some clarity,
some more comprehensive information and some principles that we can live
with that are discerned by perhaps different kinds of park spaces that we

more clearly in here, so we're comfortable and confident in how we're going
to move forward. We need to have a solid foundation. Thank you all very
much.

we are going to be making appointments. I gave the opening to Council
Members, should they wish, to make any statement, brief and one-time,
about either this item or the next item when we do CAC appointments.

Council Member Berman: (inaudible)

Mayor Holman: You could speak to both if you'd like.

Council Member DuBois: I'll kick it off real quick. Of the 12 candidates for
one position, we had several very strong candidates. Whoever is not
elected, I'd urge them to apply for other positions or get involved with our
Comp Plan. I really don't want to discourage people ...
