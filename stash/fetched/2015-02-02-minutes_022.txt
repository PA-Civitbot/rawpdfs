SUBSTITUTE MOTION: Council Member DuBois moved, seconded by
Mayor Holman to adopt a Resolution to schedule the City Councilâ€™s summer
break from July 13, 2015 to August 14, 2015.

Council Member Scharff noted the beginning date would move from July 6 to
July 13 under the Substitute Motion.

Council Member DuBois was prepared for a four-week vacation rather than a
six-week vacation.

Mayor Holman agreed that six weeks was too long.

Council Member Berman would not support the Substitute Motion. Under
the Motion, the Council could meet five Mondays in June and three Mondays
in August.

Council Member Filseth understood the only difference between the Motion
and Substitute Motion was a meeting on July 6. He inquired whether the
Council could assume a meeting on July 6 and cancel that meeting if the
Council could wrap up its business.

Mayor Holman commented that Staff planned their vacations around the
Council schedule. She preferred not to meet five Mondays a month, if it
could be avoided in June.
