Council Member Holman: A question. Is there a published list yet of when
the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) meetings are, the air noise
meetings and where they are?

Vice Mayor Scharff: There is.

Council Member Holman:     Are those on the City's website and I haven't
noticed them yet?

James Keene, City Manager: They're on the website. We'll look at how we
get the information out. We just got the information last week.

Council Member Holman: Thank you.

Mayor Burt: I'll just mention that on Saturday I went to the Matadero Creek
Bikeway pop-up event, which was pretty interesting. It was basically a one-
block length of the Water District right-of-way that was opened up for
members of the public to go through and pass through. There were maybe
over the course of the time as many as a couple hundred people who
showed up. People seemed to be very interested. I guess we'll be hearing
feedback on that in coming months. It was actually a well-attended event.

Mayor Burt: On that note, the meeting's adjourned.

Adjournment: The meeting was adjourned at 9:51 P.M.
