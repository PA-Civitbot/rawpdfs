That is to adopt a goal of raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour by
2018.

Council Member Berman: The minute I stopped and turned it over to
Council Member Scharff, I realized that I'd omitted that. I'm glad you
reintroduced it. I wholeheartedly accept it.

Mayor Holman: Council Member Scharff, do you accept that?

Council Member Scharff: I do. I was actually just wondering if we should
just adopt what they'd actually said, which was "adopt a goal of raising the
minimum wage to $15 by 2018 to coordinate and seek to create an aligned
minimum wage with surrounding cities." Do you want that whole phrase or
just the ...

Council Member Wolbach: I would be fine with replacing "c" and "d" with
Item 2 which was in our Minutes.

Council Member Scharff: That's what I was thinking.

Council Member Berman: I'd be fine with that.

Council Member Scharff:    Replace "c" and "d" and just make it one like
that.

Council Member Berman: With maybe a modification.

Mayor Holman: Can we make sure that the City Clerk's getting the
language correct? Council Member Scharff, it looks like you have the
language in front of you.

Council Member Scharff: I do. It says "adopt a goal of raising the
minimum wage to $15 by 2018 to coordinate and seek to create an aligned
minimum wage with surrounding cities."

Mayor Holman: With that, "c" is deleted. Correct?

Council Member Scharff: Correct.

Mayor Holman: We have a new "c." Council Member Berman, you're good
with that?

Council Member Berman: Yep.
