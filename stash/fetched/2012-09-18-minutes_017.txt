Ms. Tucker was unsure if it was a Council committee that met regularly. It
could have met Ad Hoc.

Vice Mayor Scharff stated it was an Ad Hoc Committee rather than a Brown
Act Committee.

Ms. Tucker indicated the committee could meet regularly or ad hoc as key
issues arose.

Council Member Burt stated a committee was not subject to the Brown Act
based on whether it met regularly. A committee was ad hoc if it met for a
limited period of time rather than ongoing. The Council had been told the
rule of thumb was a committee term of less than one year.

Ms. Stump explained a committee could be subject to the Brown Act because
it had a regular schedule established by formal action or because it had
continuing jurisdiction over a subject matter.

Vice Mayor Scharff asked if a committee with a term of less than one year
had continuing jurisdiction.

Ms. Stump reported there was not a bright line.

Vice Mayor Scharff inquired whether the term could be 14 months.

Ms. Stump said there could be a shorter period of time where the committee
exceeded the standard and had continuing jurisdiction. The Council needed
to define the subcommittee for a legal analysis.

Vice Mayor Scharff asked if the Council had to make a subcommittee
decision this evening.

Ms. Tucker answered no, unless the Council wished to refer matters to a
subcommittee.

Vice Mayor Scharff requested a Staff recommendation on the issue and the
work and role of the committee.

Ms. Stump indicated Staff could provide some options for the committee

Vice Mayor Scharff agreed with Council Member Klein's request for a
spreadsheet of projects, funding, and costs.
