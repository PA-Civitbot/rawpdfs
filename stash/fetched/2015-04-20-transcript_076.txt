Council Member Scharff: I'll make the motion in just a second. I did have
just one question. Do we look at how much this is going to add to the cost
of a home?

Mr. Pirnejad: Since it's a performance-based Code, it really depends on
what you do and how you want to meet the impacts. What we did
determine was, based on a couple of different models, that every model we
studied was cost effective at 15 percent above baseline amortized over 30
years. In every scenario we studied...

Council Member Scharff: You mean cost effective that you actually saved
money on it, is that what you mean?

Mr. Pirnejad: Right.

Council Member Scharff: Is that what you mean by cost effective?

Mr. Farahmand: Correct, yeah.

Council Member Scharff: What you do, it costs a bunch upfront, but if you
amortize that over 30 years, then you'll save money. Did you get a number
for roughly what it adds to the cost of some base home, say a 1,500-square-
foot home? I was just curious if you had a number.

Mr. Farahmand:       Yeah. The prototypes that we ran for single-family
residential which is an average 2,400-square-foot home, it would add about
$2,100 (crosstalk).

Council Member Scharff: About $2,000.

Mr. Farahmand: Yeah.

Council Member Scharff: Thank you. I can see that you put huge amounts
of effort into this. We really appreciate that. You guys seem to really
understand what was going on. I felt really comfortable with your answers.
