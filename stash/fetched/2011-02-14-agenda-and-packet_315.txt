                        repeated without intervening business or discussion; (b) when made
                        as an interruption of a member while speaking; (c) when the previous
                        question has been ordered; and (d) while a vote is being taken.

                        c) Take a recess. This motion interrupts the meeting temporarily. It
                        is amendable, but is not debatable.

                        d) Raise a question of personal privilege. This motion allows a
                        Council Member to address the Council on a question of personal
                        privilege and shall be limited to cases in which the Council
                        Member's integrity, character or motives are questioned, or when the
                        welfare of the Council is concerned. The maker of the motion may
                        interrupt another speaker if the presiding officer recognizes the
                        "privilege." The motion does not require a second, is not amendable




                                                                                                                   Attachment: 2.15.11 (1422 : Policy and Services Agenda 2/15/2011)
                        and is not debatable.

                        e) Lay on the table. This motion is used to interrupt business for
                        more urgent business. A motion to lay on the table requires a
                        second, is not amendable and is not debatable. It shall preclude all
                        amendments or debate of the subject under consideration. If the
                        motion prevails, and the subject is tabled, the matter must be
                        reagendized in the future if further consideration is to be given to the
                        matter.

                        f) Previous question. This motion “calls the question” by closing
                        debate on the pending motion. A motion for previous question
                        requires a second, is not debatable and is not amendable. It applies
                        to all previous motions on the subject unless otherwise specified by
                        the maker of the motion. If motion for previous question fails,
                        debate is reopened; if motion for previous question passes, then vote
                        on the pending motion. A motion for previous question requires a
                        two-thirds vote of those Council Members present and voting.

                        g) Limit or extend debate. This motion limits or extends the time
                        for the Council or any Council Member to debate a motion. It
                        requires a second, is amendable and is not debatable. The motion
                        requires a two-thirds vote of those Council Members present and
                        voting.

                        h) Continue to a certain time. This motion continues a matter to
                        another, specified time. It requires a second, is amendable and is
                        debatable as to propriety of postponement and time set.

                              i) Refer to a city agency, body, committee, board, commission or
                              officer. This motion sends a subject to another city agency, body,
                              committee, board, commission or officer for further study and report
