the School District could be problematic.

Council Member Freeman felt further investigation in a joint partnership with
the School District could be beneficial.

City Manager Benest said the grant did not exclude partnerships but
specified the PV system had to be on City’s facilities. He was conforming to
grant guidelines but did not oppose investigating the possibility of
partnerships in the future.

Council Member Morton asked how much of the grant would be lost if
trackers were denied.

Mr. Sartor said there would be no loss in the grant. Additional panels would
be installed at either the Cubberleyerely site or on the carports.

Council Member Morton said the public relations effect would be lost if panels
were placed elsewhere.

Mr. Sartor said application of another technology or variety of PV uses would
be lost. All other systems were static systems at a fixed angle to the sun.
The trackers would generate 35 percent more energy since they tracked the
sun to maximize the PV output.

Council Member Morton said the main loss was the demonstration effect of
the project.

Mr. Sartor said that was correct.

Council Member Morton asked what would happen to the PV system should
the MSC site become an auto dealership.

Mr. Sartor said the carport installation and trackers could be relocated but
it was unknown if the auto dealership would want to keep the PV system.

Council Member Morton said he supported the main motion but wanted to
look into funding the trackers.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION: Council Member Mossar moved, seconded by
Morton, to send the proposals for the tracker arrays located at the City’s
Municipal Service Center (MSC), as part of the City of Palo Alto Utilities
Photovoltaic Demonstration project, to the ARB for review and
recommendations to the Council, and to approve the site and design review
for the two photovoltaic carports at the MSC, based upon the findings and
