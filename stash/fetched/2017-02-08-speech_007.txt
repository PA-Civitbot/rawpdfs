strongly urging Bill Johnson, publisher of the Palo Alto Weekly, to require that people

use their real names for online comments. We should all be accountable for what we

say in the public arena. Let’s commit this year to building a community together--not

tearing one apart.




In public policy, very few issues are truly black and white—all involve tradeoffs of one

kind or another and it is almost never the case that “one size fits all.” As a community,

we should declare that no one wears a white hat or a black hat when it comes to any

local issue. Reasonable people should and do disagree.




Words and language matter, and I ask everyone in Palo Alto to recognize the good

intentions and motivations of those who hold views that are different than yours and to

resist the temptation to emulate the tone of this president.




I believe this negative dialogue and rhetoric are part of the reason that our sense of

community as a City has declined dramatically in recent years.           The City recently

conducted its annual Citizen survey and the results show that, during the last two

years, residents’ overall confidence in Palo Alto government dropped 8% and there was

a 10% drop in residents’ beliefs that their local government was generally acting in the

best interest of the community. In addition, residents also believe that the overall quality

of life in Palo Alto is falling. We need to turn this trend around and find better and more

effective ways to engage with and understand the needs of all our residents.
