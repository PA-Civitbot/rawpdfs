12.   Approval of Workplan and Timeline to Respond to Council Colleagues
      Memo Regarding Integrated Policy Discussion of Landfill Closure and
      Byxbee Park Phase II

Council Member Mossar stated a Colleagues Memo had been presented to
Council which resulted in staff returning with estimated time and energy in a
workplan.

MOTION: Council Member Mossar moved, seconded by Kishimoto that the
workplan for Byxbee Park be presented to the Parks and Recreation
Commission prior to returning to the Council.

Mayor Kishimoto stated the plan submitted to the state did not match the
Master Plan approved by Council in 1991. She asked whether there were any
irreversible landfill actions being taken which would foreclose Council options
prior to returning in July 2008.

Director of Public Works Glenn Roberts stated in terms of the grading plans
for Byxbee Park in the Master Plan, there will not be any irreversible actions
taken.

Mayor Kishimoto asked whether the full set of options would be brought to
Council in July 2008.

Mr. Roberts stated yes, consistent with the adopted Master Plan.

Mayor Kishimoto asked whether Hargreaves Associates would be involved in
each step of the process.

Mr. Roberts stated yes.

Mayor Kishimoto asked whether Hargreaves Associates would return to the
Council and Planning Commission meetings in July 2008.

Mr. Roberts stated it was possible.
