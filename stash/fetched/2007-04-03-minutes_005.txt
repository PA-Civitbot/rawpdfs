SPECIAL ORDERS OF THE DAY:

2.   Vote and Appointment        of   Applicants   to   the   Human    Relations
     Commission

MOTION: Council Member Cordell moved, seconded by Barton, to continue
the recruitment for the Human Relations Commission.

MOTION PASSED 7-1, Drekmeier no, Beecham absent.

Council Member Barton suggested expanding the recruitment process to
encourage more people to apply for Commissioner’s positions.

Mayor Kishimoto asked whether Commission members were provided an
annual training orientation program.

City Clerk Donna Rogers said position vacancies were published in the Palo
Alto Weekly and no orientation program was provided due to lack of
participation.

Council Member Morton said there was a lengthy gap between the first and
second interviews for candidates and suggested allowing a second
presentation to those wanting to come back.

Council Member Cordell said it should be the Council’s decision as to whether
a second interview should take place and not the applicant’s.

Ms. Rogers said based on Council Member Cordell’s comment she asked
what action should be taken on the previous Human Relations Commission
(HRC) applicants.
