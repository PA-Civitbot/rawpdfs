Council Member Holman: What it seems to me is that 060 is the same thing
as 0â€”I'm sorry, I keep saying that. 060 is the same thing as 090 except
that it goes on and says "without or in violation of a permit." I think they
intend the same thing. Otherwise, they seem to be a little bit in conflict with
each other.

Mayor Burt: Can I ask a clarifying question on this language?

Council Member Holman: Sure.

Mayor Burt: Is there a distinction to be made in what's intended by this
language and what's existing in the draft we have? A difference between
historic Downtown building and historic structure? Significant Downtown
building, maybe I didn't say that right.

Council Member Kniss: Is it location?

Mayor Burt: I'm asking.

Council Member Holman: The language in the Code is different.

Mayor Burt: Pardon me?

Council Member Holman: The language in the Code is different.

Mayor Burt: I don't understand in terms of the types of buildings what's a
building that is a significant Downtown building that is not a historic
structure and vice versa.

Council Member Holman: I have my opinion. We'll let Staff respond.

Mayor Burt: Pardon me?

Council Member Holman: I said I have my opinion. We'll let Staff respond.

Mr. Keene: Cut to the chase you guys.

Ms. Gitelman: Council Member Holman, we're looking at it. I think we could
live with the change that you've suggested. Removing 090 and leaving 060
with a wording change.

Council Member Holman: The wording change would be "demolition of a
downtown historic structure or site with or without or in violation of a
permit."
