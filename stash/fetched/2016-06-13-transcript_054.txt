Resource Allocation Process (HSRAP)” with “Human Services including
Human Services Resource Allocation Process (HSRAP) grantees.”

Council Member Wolbach: That's great. Thank you for working with us to
make sure that we give you the flexibility you need for that. Beyond that, I
have nothing else to add. I think it's a great Motion and great work all
around.

Mayor Burt: Council Member Filseth.

Council Member Filseth: I think I mostly (inaudible) ...

Mayor Burt: Your mic.

Council Member Filseth: I think I mostly responded when Council Member
Kniss was talking. Let me ask a question on Number B. Does this constrain
that it can't go—when it says "other post-employment benefits," does that
constrain this can't go to pension?

Mr. Perez: It'd probably be best if you clarify if you want pension or retiree
medical or both.

Council Member Filseth: How about if it were "pension or other post-
employment benefits"? Would that work?

Vice Mayor Scharff: I thought we were really doing this for pension.                    I
thought that was the issue.

Council Member Filseth: Other Post Employee Benefit (OPEB) is jargon for
everything but pension, so healthcare and stuff like that.

Vice Mayor Scharff: Shouldn't we just say "pension"? Does anyone disagree
with that? Isn't that what we set it up originally for?

Mr. Perez: You have two already—we already have a retiree medical trust
set up.

Vice Mayor Scharff: Right, we do. That's what I mean.

Mr. Perez: We are trying to establish the pension one. If you intend this for
pension, it should be pension.

Vice Mayor Scharff: I intend this for pension.

Council Member Filseth: (crosstalk) pension benefits instead.
