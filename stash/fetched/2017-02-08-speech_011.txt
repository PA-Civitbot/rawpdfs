In the next month, the Council will be considering and acting on some housing policy

issues, including Accessory Dwelling Units, housing impact fees, and incentives for

small lot consolidation. However, what we must do is actually produce housing, not just

housing projects are designed in accordance with neighborhood and community goals.

My goal for this year is not to just talk about housing, but to get at least two significant

market rate projects and one affordable project in the pipeline. Again, this is modest but

achievable.




The second priority is Budget & Finance. Pensions and benefits continue to rise faster

than revenues, creating challenges for the City’s finances. We need to continue to be

prudent in how we manage our money. We need to grow revenues and Eric Filseth

(chair of Finance Committee last year and again this year) is well versed in the nuances

of our City budget. He will lead the Committee in tough discussions about how to close

the structural deficit in our budget without impacting services to our community while

continuing to fund our infrastructure projects. Eric has also been leading the charge for

the Council to address the City’s unfunded pension liabilities and under Eric’s

leadership, I expect us to make progress in this area.

       Councilmember Filseth could you please stand up? Let’s give a hand for

       Councilmember Filseth for taking on these important leadership roles.

The third priority is transportation. This year, we will begin construction on a handful of

neighborhood traffic safety and bicycle boulevard projects that have been in the

planning and design phases for several years, and we will be implementing the planned
