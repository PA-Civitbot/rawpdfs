I.       Public Participation in Council Meetings

         A. Policy. It is the policy of the City Council to assure that members of the public
         have the opportunity to speak to any regular or special meeting agenda item before
         final action. These rules establish the rights and obligations of persons who wish to
         speak during City Council meetings.

             (1)     Purpose. These rules are intended to enhance public participation and
         Council debate so that the best possible decisions can be made for Palo Alto. Palo
         Alto has a long and proud tradition of open government and civil, intelligent public
         discourse. Open government meetings must allow everyone to be heard without fear
         of cheers or jeers. For these reasons, the City Council takes these rules seriously.
         Disruptive or unruly behavior in violation of the law can result in removal from the




                                                                                                                  Attachment: 2.15.11 (1422 : Policy and Services Agenda 2/15/2011)
         Council meeting and/or arrest and prosecution.

             (2)    Summary of Rules. Every regular City Council agenda has two different
         kinds of opportunities for the public to speak. The first is during Oral
         Communications. This part of the meeting is provided so that the public can speak
         to anything that is in the City’s jurisdiction, even if there is no action listed on the
         agenda. The Council allows three minutes per speaker, but limits the total time to 30
         minutes per meeting. State law does not permit the Council to respond to oral
         communications, but City staff may be asked to follow up on any concerns that are
         raised.

             The second opportunity to speak is during the public comment or public hearing
         portion of Each Agenda Item. Public comments or testimony must be related to the
         matter under consideration. The Council allows three minutes per speaker for most
         matters. During “quasi-judicial” hearings (where the City Council is legally
         required to take evidence and make impartial decisions based upon that evidence),
         the applicant or appellant may have up to ten minutes at the outset and three minutes
         for rebuttal at the end. These hearings are specially marked on the Council agenda.

            A person who wants to speak to the Council must fill out a speaker card and
         hand it in to the City Clerk. The Clerk will give the cards to the Mayor or Vice
         Mayor so that the speakers can be identified and organized in an orderly way.

         B. General Requirements.

                    1. Accessibility. Palo Alto makes every reasonable effort to accommodate
                    the needs of the disabled. Any provision of these rules may be modified if
                    needed to provide reasonable accommodation. Persons needing assistance
