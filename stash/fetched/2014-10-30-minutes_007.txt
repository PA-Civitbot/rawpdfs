Vice Mayor Kniss suggested reviewing other cities recruitment flyers for City
Clerks for a more updated description.

Ms. Shen requested to add critical thinking skills in addition to the ability to
operate the technological capabilities of the office.

Mayor Shepherd asked for a new term for self-starter.

Vice Mayor Kniss believed that terminology fell under critical thinker and
initiative.

Mayor Shepherd asked Staff to bring back the City Clerk financial package;
she believed the current position had a vehicle allowance.

Council Member Klein clarified the City Council established a Policy that there
would no longer be a vehicle allowance.

Ms. Shen agreed to return to the Committee with the current City Clerk
financial package. The current base was $134,784 plus the vehicle
allowance.

Mayor Shepherd asked for Staff to return to the Committee with the City
Clerk’s retirement plan and the City Auditor’s retirement plan. She noted the
City Manager had a vehicle allowance and asked if the City Attorney did as
well.

Ms. Shen agreed to supply the information and noted she did not believe the
City Attorney had a vehicle allowance but she would verify. The City
Attorney did have a larger deferred compensation plan than the current City
Clerk package.
