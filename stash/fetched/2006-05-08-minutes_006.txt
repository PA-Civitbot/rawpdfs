5.    Resolution No. 8607 entitled “Resolution of the Council of the City of Palo
      Alto Endorsing Measure C in the Foothill/De Anza Community College
      District”

MOTION PASSED        9-0

MOTION: Council Member Klein moved, seconded by Morton, to reconsider
the vote for Consent Calendar Items Nos. 3 through 5 to hear public comment.

MOTION PASSED 9-0

Gary Wesley, 707 Continental Circle, Mountain View, said Item No. 5 should not
have been approved. Ballot material for Measure C was not in the staff report
(CMR:208:06) because the Resolution did not list specific projects for funding
and violated Proposition 39.

Cheryl Lilienstein, 4050 Manzana Lane, spoke in support of Item No. 6. She
presented a Digital Versatile Disc (DVD) that contained agencies across the
Country in support of paper ballots and verified elections. She urged Council
to support the Resolution and stressed the importance of city agencies speaking
to County officials who were responsible for elections.

Emily Levy, 137 Plateau Avenue, Santa Cruz, spoke in support of Item No. 6
and urged the Council to encourage higher officials in the Country to support
the Help America Vote Act.

Shauna Wilson, Human Relations Commission Chairperson, said the
Commission felt the current voting system was unreliable and did not instill
confidence in State, Federal, and local residents. She asked the Council to pass
the Resolution.

MOTION: Council Member Morton moved, seconded by Klein, to approve
Consent Calendar Items Nos. 3 through 5.

MOTION PASSED 9-0
