Council Member Mossar said the Planning and Transportation Commission
(P&TC) and the Architectural Review Board (ARB) were thoughtful and
thorough with the projects.

Council Member Morton asked whether there was the danger of the height
increasing to 40 feet.

Director of Planning and Community Environment Steve Emslie said variances
were based on individual site characteristics and circumstances. The urban
objective was to have more presence and buildings on El Camino Real.

Council Member Kishimoto noted the photometric map numbers increased at
the back of the lot and decreased closer to the front of the building.

Mr. Lippert said the lighting should be shielded so it did not spill onto the
neighboring properties.

Council Member Kishimoto asked about the lighting at the rear of the lot and
its impact on the neighborhood.

Ken Hayes said trees at the back of the property and adjustment of the height
of the light standards would bring the light levels off the neighboring
properties.

Council Member Kishimoto said the projects were well designed and within the
Cityâ€™s 50-foot height limits.

Council Member Beecham said staff and the P&TC had taken a reasonable
approach to the projects.

Mayor Burch said he was looking forward to seeing the projects along El
Camino Real.

MOTION: Council Member Mossar moved, seconded by Kleinberg, to (1)
approve the Mitigated Negative Declaration (Attachment L) for the project at
1805 El Camino Real, with a finding that the project would not result in
significant environmental impacts; and (2) approve the Site and Design
Review application to allow the construction of a new office building and
related site improvements in the CN Neighborhood Commercial District, based
on the findings in the draft Record of Land Use Action

MOTION PASSED 9-0.
