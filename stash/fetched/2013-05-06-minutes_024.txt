Ms. Shen reported Staff met with the Council to discuss pensions and
benefits costs. Staff would meet with employees to review options for
controlling costs. Staff needed flexibility to attract employees looking for
higher salaries or volunteer opportunities. Younger employees were not
concerned about pension benefits.

Council Member Schmid asked if Palo Alto's retirement age was earlier than
comparable cities.

Ms. Shen indicated Palo Alto's retirement age was similar to other cities
under CalPERS.

Council Member Schmid stated Palo Alto was 10 percent different from other
cities.

Mr. Keene explained the difference was retiree medical costs. Generally,
Palo Alto was similar to other cities with respect to the pension retirement
age, except for newer employees.

Ms. Shen noted the cost study was prepared prior to requiring employees to
contribute more to CalPERS. If the study was performed in 2013, then the
percentage would be smaller.

MOTION: Council Member Schmid moved, seconded by Council Member
Holman to refer this item to the Finance Committee.

Council Member Schmid felt a detailed discussion and concrete examples
would be helpful.

Council Member Holman believed the information merited a vetting by the
Finance Committee.

Council Member Price inquired whether deferring action would defer
implementation of the plan changes.

Ms. Shen replied yes.

Council Member Price asked if salary increases for Management and
Professional Employees would also be delayed.

Ms. Shen answered yes.

Council Member Price felt the work and the study were defensible. For this
particular cycle, referring the plan to the Finance Committee was not
                                                                      Page 24 of 26
