Council Member Cordell asked whether it made a difference to the
proceedings if there was no notice of appeal given to Mr. Bradshaw.

Mr. Bayer said it would not make a difference to the proceedings because
they were not legally challenged by any other form such as a Writ of
Mandate.

Council Member Cordell asked if the Council’s decision could be affected if
Mr. Bradshaw was not given a notice of appeal.

Mr. Bayer confirmed.

Council Member Kleinberg asked whether the remaining vehicles, the duck
and sailboat still on the property were in violation of the Code.

Mr. Bayer said the items were in violation of the order of the hearing officer.

Council Member Kleinberg said the Council was being asked to impose the
lien as a penalty for non-compliance and for the cost to the City.

Mr. Bayer said what was before the Council that evening was a collections
matter.

Council Member Kleinberg said it was based on non-compliance and non-
responsiveness.

Mr. Bayer said the intent was not to overlook on-going violations by Mr.
Bradshaw on any of the properties.

Council Member Kleinberg said the Council was not looking at the continuing
violations.

Mr. Bayer confirmed.

Council Member Kleinberg asked about the annual weed abatement of the
properties, as experienced by Code Enforcement.

Mr. Bayer said the weed situation had been abated annually.        There were
continuing Code violations at the Campesino Avenue property.

Council Member Kleinberg asked about a vehicle placed on the property after
Mr. Bradshaw was informed that long-term parking of cars was not in
compliance with the City’s Code.
