          o   The proposed six angled parking spaces along the north side of California Avenue between
              Park Boulevard and the driveway entrance to the Molly Stone market. Changing these parking
              spaces from 60-degrees to 45-degrees results in the loss of one new parking space providing
              five spaces instead. This is still one space more than the existing four parking spaces under
              existing conditions.

          o   The proposed eight angled parking spaces along the south side of California Avenue between
              Park Boulevard (East) and Park Boulevard (West). Changing these parking spaces from 60-
              degrees to 45-degrees results in the loss of two new parking spaces providing six spaces
              instead. This is still one space more than the existing five parking spaces under existing
              conditions.
