Council Member Kniss: That's acceptable. I would strongly support first on
the agenda, because we need some bandwidth on that.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to replace in the Motion, “to a date certain” with
“June 15, 2015 as the first Action Agenda Item.”

Mayor Holman: We do have the budget on that night, for sure.

Mr. Keene: I'm just trying to ...

Mayor Holman: The amendment is for the 15th.

Mr. Keene: Why the 15th rather than the 8th? This was with a reason for
the Mayor and I to be able to look. Right now on the 8th, you have the
budget and the Fry's item. The Fry's item is not necessarily time sensitive.

Council Member Scharff: We have Fry's on the 8th.

Mr. Keene: On the 8th, yes.

Council Member Filseth: Madam Mayor, I'm not available on the 8th.

Mayor Holman: I'm not looking at the agenda, the upcoming agenda. Is the
8th better?

Mr. Keene: The 8th has the first hearings on the budget and utility rates
and Fry's.

Council Member Scharff: It doesn't matter. Council Member Filseth said
he's not available on the 8th, and Council Member Burt said he's not
available on the 22nd or the 29th. My goal here was to allow all Council
Members on a sensitive item like this to participate. Therefore, the 15th is
the date in the motion, and I'm sticking with that. If anyone wants to
override, override it. That's what I'm putting in the motion.

Mayor Holman: Council Member Filseth, you're not available on the 8th, but
you were suggesting the 8th.

Council Member Filseth: No, I'm suggesting the 15th.

Council Member Scharff: No, he suggested the 15th.

Mayor Holman: I thought you switched it to the 8th. We are at the 15th.
