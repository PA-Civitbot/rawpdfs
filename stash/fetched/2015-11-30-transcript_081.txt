Mayor Holman: Vote on the board please. That also passes unanimously.

MOTION PASSED: 9-0

Mayor Holman: With that, it has been brought to my attention that we've
had a lot of people with us this evening. It's been brought to my attention
that probably most of the people here are here for the single-story overlay.
If you're here for the single-story overlay, would you stand for a moment?
If you would sit, please. If you're here to speak to the fiber matter, would
you stand? It looks as though we'll be taking these items in order, because
we have a number of people to speak to both of these items. Again, bear
with us. For Council Members' information, the Closed Session tonight,
while it's slated for an hour, looks like it's going to take 15, maybe 20,
minutes. Keep that in mind.
