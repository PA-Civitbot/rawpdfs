Ms. Rogers responded one holiday should not be recognized without the
others. Therefore, it would be removed from the resolution.

Mayor Kishimoto suggested the first line of the resolution show what it is
that would be removed for clarity.

City Attorney Gary Baum stated under the Charter, the earliest date the new
Council would be sworn in would be January 1. California State Law stated
any action taken on a holiday, would not be deemed an action. The earliest
possible date, therefore, would be January 2.

Council Member Barton questioned whether the motion was to remove the
swearing in of newly elected Council Members from the first meeting in
January.

Vice Mayor Klein answered that would be correct.

Council Member Barton asked whether additional meetings would meet the
Brown Act Noticing requirements.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION:        Council Member Barton moved, seconded by
Morton, to approve the resolution removing July 4 and allowing the City
Council to adjust the schedule after the Policy and Services Committee
recommendations in April.

Council Member Morton stated the Winter break would be between
December 24 and January 4, and changes to the Council schedule would be
made after the Policy and Services Committee met in April.

Council Member Kleinberg mentioned Columbus Day was not a widely
recognized holiday.

Ms. Rogers added that City Hall is closed on Columbus Day.

Council Member Kleinberg replied City Hall would be closed, which is the
reason the Council was not going to meet.

Ms. Rogers stated there are times when the Council would meet the day
after a holiday, which would be a Special Meeting.

Council Member Kleinberg stated with City Hall closed, Columbus Day should
not be considered vacation.

Ms. Rogers stated the resolution would be titled “Scheduling the Council
Vacation and Cancelling of Council Meetings.”
