units. The intent is that the yellow boxes are knobs to twist and see the
impact on demand for other kinds of services. For example, the yellow
boxes are knobs to twist. The pink boxes are major results. Let me briefly
stop. If you look at Line 9, the jobs-housing ratio is currently about 3.3. If
both jobs and housing units grow at the same rate, then in 30 years it'll still
be 3.3. The population of Palo Alto is about 66,000 right now. At 1 percent
growth per year, in 30 years it'll be about 89,000. Let me look at services
for a second. The second section of this is divided into three categories. Let
me just do the simple one which is park space. If you look at in-town park
space, today we have about 175 acres of in-town park space. That's a ratio
of about 2.65 acres per 1,000 Palo Alto residents. The Comp Plan actually
says we should have 3-4 acres of park space per 1,000 residents. As of
today, we have about 2.65. If the City's population increases 1 percent per
year over 30 years, then in order to keep 2.65 acres per 1,000 residents in
30 years, we'll need 236 acres of park space or 61 acres more than we have
now. Suppose we decide that we'd like to support faster housing growth in
order to reduce the jobs-housing ratio. Let's say we targeted 1.5 percent
per year housing to the extent that governments can target this stuff,
instead of 1 percent. In 30 years if we did that, we'd have 103,000 people
living here for the same 121,000 jobs, assuming jobs grew at 1 percent per
year. That would bring the jobs-housing ratio down to under 3, under 2.9.
On the other hand, to keep 2.65 acres of park space per resident, we'd now
need 99 new acres of park space instead of 61. Land is pretty expensive
around Palo Alto. We might decide that instead of 2.65 acres of park space
per resident, maybe we ought to target 1.75 acres of park resident per
1,000 residents instead. In that case, we wouldn't need any more park
space. Is that a good idea? You can't tell from this, but it's the kind of
discussion we ought to have. If we do decide we want 1.75 acres of park
space per 1,000 residents, then the Comp Plan shouldn't say 4 acres
anymore. This is the kind of discussion we ought to have. I've taken a
whack at two other services, which I won't spent time talking about. Traffic
is incredibly complicated to do. The real answer to that is have the EIR do
it.   I tried to do a really simple model that looked at alternative
transportation and job growth. Water is self-explanatory. I also did some
modeling, which is not in here, relative to school considerations, which is
obviously a huge priority for a lot of Palo Alto residents. Some people have
seen some of this, but it's not in this version. State law places some
restriction how school issues are to be treated in municipal considerations.
Before this goes into this, I want to make sure that whatever we do is done
properly. Again, this is designed so that people can plug in their own
numbers and extend to their own services to try to look at these kinds of
discussions. I hope this will be a useful part of the discussion as we figure
out how to trade off this versus that. I don't know that it needs to be part of
the Comp Plan. It ought to be part of the discussion. If people have better
