4.   Schedule for Phase 2 of the South of Forest Avenue Coordinated Area
     Plan and Impacts on Other Planning Division Work Items and Related
     800 High Street Referendum Issues (continued from 4/14/03)

Council Member Morton stated he would not participate in the item due to a
conflict of interest because he had a client within the SOFA Plan area.

City Attorney Calonne said it was Council Member Mortonâ€™s decision not to
participate. The matter did not create a foreseeable chance of an impact on

her participation. She told Council Member Morton his comments were
welcomed, but his personal choice would be honored. She asked him to
state for the record which decision he had made.

Council Member Morton was concerned that he had not heard from Mr.
Calonne that there was no conflict. However, given the possibility of a
conflict he excused himself from the discussion.

old Palo Alto Medical Foundation site and SOFA 2 encompassed the area
between Alma, High, Emerson, and Ramona Streets.            Transferring the
management of the project to a Senior Planner, which had been done by
Chief Planning Official Lisa Grote, could escalate the schedule. It would be
appropriate for that to occur in the advanced planning section where the
