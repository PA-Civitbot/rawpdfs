fee.

Richard Ellson, 513 El Capitan Place, said seed money was needed to
jumpstart the project and urged the Council to approve the safety impact
fee.

Kit Miller, 265 Scripps Court, was in support of the impact fee.

Rosa Huang, 504 El Capitan Place, supported approval of the impact fee to
enhance the safety of the area before a tragedy occurred.

Betsy Allyn, 4186 Willmar Drive, was in support of implementing the impact
fees.

Jean Wilcox, 4005 Sutherland Drive, asked the Council not to reduce
Charleston Road to two lanes in the area of Grove Avenue, Sutherland Drive,
and Middlefield Road going west in the enhancement plan. The Floor Area
Ratio (FAR) doubled on the Campus for Jewish Life (CJL) creating more
vehicles on Charleston Road and would add to the traffic congestion on
Sutherland Drive due to traffic cut-through.

Thomas A. Vician, 3718 Redwood Circle, was in favor of the impact fee to
enhance the safety of the corridor.

Bob McIntire, project manager for Nova Partners, representing the Palo Alto
Elks Project, 855 El Camino Real, spoke regarding their support for the
impact fees and safety measures of the corridor.

Darlene Snodgrass, 745 Maplewood Place, raised concern regarding impact
to the neighborhood. She asked the project be discontinued if it did not
work during the trial plan.
