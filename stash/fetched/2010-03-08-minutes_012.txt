Mr. Sartor stated Staff had identified three major capital areas where there
would be bidding; the Street Maintenance Program, the Sidewalk
Replacement Program and the Utility Department Sewer Main Replacement
Program. He stated there were ten Charter cities within the State of
California that did not require prevailing wage; on the peninsula Palo Alto
was the only one.

Council Member Scharff asked the total cost for the study.

Mr. Sartor stated at the present stage it would be Staff time with no outside
costs.

Council Member Scharff asked the amount of Staff time required.

Mr. Sartor stated he was uncertain of the time to be expended.

Council Member Scharff clarified the goal would be to review two projects,
one with prevailing wage and one without.

Mr. Sartor stated no, there would be six projects reviewed; streets,
sidewalks and sewer, three with prevailing wage and three without.

Council Member Scharff asked what determined this process was the most
accurate approach.

Mr. Keene stated the study was limited, he noted a local survey would
provide comparable data.

Council Member Scharff asked the rationale for not having included Below
Market Rate (BMR) housing projects.

Mr. Sartor stated low income housing projects were exempt by law from
being prevailing wage.

Council Member Scharff asked the rationale behind legally exempting those
projects.

City Attorney, Gary Baum stated he would research the reasons and return
with a response at a later date.

Council Member Price asked whether the survey questions would be refined
prior to being sent out.
