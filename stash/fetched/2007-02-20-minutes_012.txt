whether there was a figure of the exact number of parcels in the City that
could possibly be subdivided.

Mr. Emslie stated he did not have the figures.

Council Member Drekmeier stated more possible subdivisions could have a
severe impact on the character of neighborhoods throughout the City.

Council Member Morton asked if this subdivision was denied, would the
owners of the lot be able to build a granny unit.

Mr. Emslie replied yes because the lot was over the minimum size required
for a granny unit.

Council Member Morton stated the parcel did not need to be subdivided to
house other family members.

Mayor Kishimoto stated the lot lines define the character of the
neighborhood and, on that basis, she would vote against this motion. She
asked whether there were 8,000 square foot parcels on map R-1.

Mr. Williams answered yes. The proposed subdivision would be adjusted to
meet that requirement.

Council Member Beecham asked whether a 16,000 square foot lot could
have a 5,000 square foot structure.

Mr. Williams stated they estimated 5,600 square feet.

Council Member Beecham asked how large a structure could be on an 8,000
square foot lot.

Mr. Williams stated they estimated 3,000 square feet.

Council Member Beecham stated the Council decision should be based on the
amount of land.

Council Member Drekmeier asked how large a granny unit could be built.

Mr. Williams replied 900 square foot.

Council Member Drekmeier stated the material presented by the appellants
showed the square footage of the lots in the neighborhood. It appeared
about 75 percent of the homes in the neighborhood had lot sizes larger than
10,000 square feet.
