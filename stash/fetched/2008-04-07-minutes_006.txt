11B. (former No. 6)     Approval of a Contract with Synlawn, Inc. in the
     Amount of $399,939 for the Renovation of the Driving Range at the Palo
     Alto Municipal Golf Course, Capital Improvement Program Project
     PG-08001.

Council Member Burt stated his concerns about the necessity of investing
time in the renovation of the driving range which in the near future may be
relocated.

Community Services Director Richard James replied this was the proper time
because both the turf and the netting were posing safety issues. Any
changes to the golf course location would be years down the road by their
estimations.

Council Member Burt stated his concern with the redesign of the golf course.
He asked if Staff could assure the Council that an argument wouldn’t be
made regarding the amount of money spent for this project.

Mr. James replied he couldn’t make assurances, but he knew what was at
the driving range now needed to be replaced. He didn’t foresee any redesign
happening for many years into the future.
