Ms. Van Der Zwaag reported funding for PACCC and Avenidas increased by
7.2 percent.

Vice Mayor Shepherd asked if 7.2 percent of the original 10 percent
reduction was restored.

Ms. Van Der Zwaag replied yes.

Vice Mayor Shepherd indicated the question for the Council was whether
$1.2 million would be the base funding for HSRAP.

Mr. Perez suggested the Council provide direction to Staff regarding base
funding for HSRAP.

MOTION: Vice Mayor Shepherd moved, seconded by Council Member Price
to establish a base Human Services Resource Allocation Process at
$1,216,178 going forward as an advisory measure to the Finance
Committee.

Mr. Keene recommended the Motion be voted on separately as it was a
direction to Staff for the FY 2015 Budget and would not be part of the
Budget Ordinance Amendment.

Mayor Scharff clarified that the Motion was advisory for the Finance
Committee.

Mr. Keene reported Staff would propose a Budget for FY 2015 utilizing base
funding of $1.2 million for HSRAP.

Council Member Klein understood that a significantly smaller percentage of
funds was allocated to PACCC and Avenidas.

Ms. O’Nan reported it was difficult to allocate funds to agencies that were so
disparate in size. The HRC focused on the smaller agencies to fill critical
unmet needs.

Council Member Klein was concerned about the process for allocating funds.
Some organizations were larger than Avenidas and PACCC.

Ms. O’Nan indicated in terms of amount, PACCC and Avenidas received more
funding that the smaller agencies.

Council Member Klein felt the HRC historically had difficulty funding Avenidas
and PACCC.
