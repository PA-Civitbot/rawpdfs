Council Member Cordell inquired about the number of vehicles on the
property, the size of the duck and the size of the sailboat.

Mr. Bradshaw said there were three or four vehicles, the duck was the size
of a Volkswagen Bug, and the sailboat was a Hobee Cat on a trailer.

Council Member Cordell asked whether Mr. Bradshawâ€™s refusal to remove
those items was because he did not believe they were in violation.

Mr. Pintar confirmed.

Mr. Bradshaw said he did not have any place to store them.

store them or whether he did not believe they were in violation.

The items of personal worth and value remained on the property and were
not visible from the street.

Mr. Bradshaw confirmed. All of the repair work had been completed.

Council Member Ojakian asked when the repair work had been completed.

Mr. Bradshaw said the repair work on Metro Circle had been completed in
April 2003.

that the items had been corrected.

Mr. Pintar said the two large railroad cargo containers were ordered to be
removed in September 2000 and had been removed on or about February

essentially finished in December 2002. He did not get the final inspection on
the repair.

Mr. Pintar said the air compressor and the electronic racks were reported
completed at least two to three years prior.
