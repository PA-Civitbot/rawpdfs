Council Member Kleinberg said the current climate of Palo Alto was to
encourage businesses to evolve and could increase traffic. She would not
support the motion unless the Resolution was more defined.

Council Member Morton clarified Council was not to specify the amount or
range of the traffic mitigation measures but to announce a policy of
adopting a form of mitigation imposed on current and future projects.
Council would provide the appropriate mitigation level to current projects to
bear their fair share.

Council Member Cordell asked when Council would be asked to approve the
transportation impact fee.

Mr. Emslie said in mid-May.

Council Member Cordell asked if the Resolution were approved, would
monies be collected between now and the time when transportation impact
fees were approved.

Mr. Emslie said no.

Council Member Cordell asked how much revenue would be generated
between now and the adoption of the impact fee for projects in process.

Mr. Emslie said approximately $100,000.

Council Member Kishimoto said she was in favor of adopting the Resolution
since applicants would pay a portion of the impact fees.

Council Freeman supported the motion.

Council Member Ojakian asked if projects tagged by the Resolution would
be provided in May.

Mr. Emslie said they would be provided.

Council Member Ojakian asked for clarification on levied fees against new
trips generated by change in land use. Did it mean change in zoning or to
cover any intensification of a particular site even if zoning were not
changed.

Mr. Emslie said it related to a level of intensity change.

Council Member Ojakian said he supported the motion.
