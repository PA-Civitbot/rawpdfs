                       DRAFT MINUTES
Council Member Burt suggested that they keep the first sentence
that applied to 2012-2013 and then Council Member Price’s
sentence going forward.

Council Member Klein said he hoped the process would be over by
the end of 2013, so he did not favor including Council Member
Price’s language. He felt that would delay things. He thought it
was better to have a clear guideline of 50 percent each through
some specific date.

Council Member Holman was concerned about the fair share
component of it and stated she left it to the committee to decide.
She did not know if architectural design should be included.

Mayor Yeh stated he did have “fair share/proportional” as
opposed to “equally.” He suggested a vote in the form of a straw
poll. For “2012-2013” six Council Members voted yes. Two
Council members favored various phases.       He indicated they
would include “2012-2013.”

Council Member Burt thought they had addressed it by the prior
sentence.

Mayor Yeh stated that it was still equal but was time limited. He
had no changes for Guiding Principle Number 8. Guiding Principle
Number 9 was “school quality and capacity is a significant
citywide issue considered essential to the maintenance of
educational opportunities and excellence, and the overall health
and well-being of our community.” Concerning Guiding Principle
Number 10 he had “the types of programs offered by the City and
its contractors and subtenants at Cubberley enrich the community
and every effort should be made to preserve and enhance.” The
alternative suggestion was language along the lines of
“prioritization of existing and identification of potential community
services.”
