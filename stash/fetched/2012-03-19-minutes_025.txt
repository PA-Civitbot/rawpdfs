Mr. Williams said it was for 16 spaces only.

Council Member Schmid asked if the covenant covered a change in activity at
that site.

Mr. Williams answered no.

Council Member Schmid inquired whether Staff was confident parking would
not be a problem in the future.

Mr. Williams replied yes.

Council Member Schmid noted on page 451 there was not an economic
analysis of the revenues generated or of the cost of City services for the
General Fund budget, which was projected in deficit. He thought it was very
important to have a sense of the net economic contribution new developments
would make. He stated the City had a model developed in the Stanford
negotiations where two economic firms reached an agreement on how the City
should assess the cost of services. He stated it would be helpful on major
projects like this to utilize the models established to provide a sense of net
service costs.

Council Member Burt could not find good circulation maps and plans, and
asked if they were in the Packet.

Mr. Williams indicated it was in the EIR with the TIRE Analysis.

Council Member Burt reported all these drawings were on-site, and did not
extend to Embarcadero. He stated one change was the right-turn only from
West Bayshore to Embarcadero.

Mr. Rodriguez agreed.

Council Member Burt inquired whether there was better queuing for left-turn
from Embarcadero onto West Bayshore.

Mr. Rodriguez said queuing was onto St. Francis, while Embarcadero to West
Bayshore remained the same.

Council Member Burt asked if Staff had any discussions with Caltrans about
the off-ramp and ways to reduce the speed.

Mr. Rodriguez replied Staff had not as part of this project or as far as
operations within Palo Alto.
