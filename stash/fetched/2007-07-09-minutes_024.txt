Mr. Fellman said the purpose of the TDR was when the market is up, there
was a higher rent per square foot. The TDR allowed a buyer to purchase,
hold and resell. The property would remain a City asset.

Vice Mayor Klein asked whether a TDR had been transferred to a non-profit,
public/private partnership previously.

Mr. Fellman said no and the people with the Roth Building were interested in
the sale of TDR.

Council Member Mossar stated TDR issues arose for the renovation of
specific historic properties.

Mr. Yeats said the intent was to auction the TDR and present the proceeds to
the EV to be used as part of the project.

Council Member Mossar asked for clarification whether EV thought they were
going to receive the TDR to sell.

Mr. Yeats said the original negotiation was that the revenue generated would
go towards the construction funding.

Council Member Mossar asked for the maker of the Motion to clarify his
intent.

Council Member Drekmeier noted the intent was to allow the TDR to apply to
the projectâ€™s capital cost.

Council Member Morton requested clarification for the percentage of funds
from the TDR to be used for specific projects.

Mr. Yeats said the intent of the new policy was to allow the Council to
designate how the funds were to be spent on any City-owned historic
building.

Council Member Morton asked whether the current commitment was for the
entire sale of the TDR.

Mr. Yeats said the original intent was for the entire sale.

Council Member Morton suggested authorizing the sale and return to
designate the amount to be applied.
