Mr. Keene reported the Council's direction through the negotiations was
clear acknowledgement that these were one-time monies and they needed
to be spent carefully, essentially for things that provided a return for the
City, which spoke to non-ongoing expenses and capital projects. He stated
it might have a good connection for Staff to provide an update on that. He
suggested the Council could give more specific direction.

Council Member Shepherd inquired if the Mitchell Park Community Center
would be presented to the Council separately. She asked if the Council
should be providing input concerning programs.

Mr. Keene indicated it could be part of a discussion with the Council on the
Community Services budget or, if appropriate, Staff would agendize this for
discussion at a regular Council meeting.


ADJOURNMENT: The meeting was adjourned at 9:52 P.M.
