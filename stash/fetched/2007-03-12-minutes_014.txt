Mr. Benest stated transportation and affordable housing are the two major
impacts.

Council Member Beecham asked for clarification on the Environmental
Impact Report (EIR) and whether it would include transportation and
housing impacts and would mitigations be recommended.

Mr. Benest stated the EIR would analyze the impacts with specific numbers
and there would be a mitigation program for transportation, affordable
housing, and other impacts.

Council Member Beecham stated he did not support the motion.

Council Member Morton stated the end cost for Stanford might be greater
than the $16/square foot. He questioned the impact fees for Oak Court and
Heritage Court.

Mr. Benest stated there was a package of programs for Oak Court, such as
park property, a childcare center, and the Roth Building to mitigate impacts,
as well as, provide community benefits.

Council Member Barton stated it was important to distinguish projects that
were developable by right and projects that were not. Housing developers
had requirements to build affordable housing under the zoning ordinance.

Council Member Kleinberg asked why convalescent homes were removed
from the exemption.

Mr. Emslie replied convalescent homes could stay exempt without a major
impact on the housing impact.

Council Member Kleinberg asked why there was no waiver possibility
provided.

Mr. Baum stated he was not sure whether the issue would be considered.

Mr. Emslie repeated the waiver would not be considered for smaller facilities.

Mr. Baum recommended against the waiver because it would be difficult to
administer; however, it could be done through the development agreement.

Council Member Kleinberg asked for clarification on the process.

Mr. Baum stated exempting an individual project would be done through the
development agreement.

Council Member Kleinberg asked why other cities include waivers in
ordinances.
