Mr. Keene inquired whether there would be an advantage to legal review
before approving the acceptance of the SAP contract.

Mr. Baum stated a review of the SAP contract could not be performed for
$10,000.

Mayor Drekmeier asked whether the contract could be reviewed for $10,000.

Mr. Baum stated he could have someone look at it.

Council Member Yeh spoke of his support for the intent of the legal review.
Moving forward, he felt the Request for Proposal should have a legal review
built in as it would be the next big expenditure on the SAP system. He

development building.

Mr. Perez stated SAP system long-term goals, such as Smart Grid, were not
anticipated to have large expenditures.
