Ms. Furth said staff reviewed the decision before the Council about the
traffic generating consequences of the proposed change and decided
they should be confined under the terms of the Ordinance. Secondly,
staff believed the project, as proposed, appeared to be consistent with
the Comprehensive Plan. Staff wanted permission to start the review
process.

Vice Mayor Beecham said it was not a zoning issue. The area would
come forward in the process for appropriate reviews.

Council Member Kishimoto wanted clarification that Council was not
being asked to approve the project. She queried if the project would
come before the Council or if it could be approved administratively.

Ms. Grote said the Architectural Review Board (ARB) would review it as
a major architectural review application.

Council Member Kishimoto said it could then be appealed through the
Council.

Ms. Grote confirmed.

Council Member Kishimoto said the traffic impact was being discussed
and not the zoning.

Council Member Burch said the property would not contribute to traffic
in that area.

Council Member Morton said the issue was traffic. He questioned the
City Attorney if it was appropriate to comment on the transition of the
area to housing.

Ms. Furth said the Brown Act was to advise the public what would be
talked about. The public would be able to draw the conclusion if the
project should be exempt from the transportation-based moratorium
and be allowed to proceed as an application before the City.

Council Member Morton said he wanted to call for the question, based
on the issue of whether it should be removed from the moratorium.

Mayor Mossar called for a vote.

MOTION PASSED 9-0.
