Vice Mayor Kleinberg said it was not a shared rate adjustment.

Mr. Marshall confirmed.

Vice Mayor Kleinberg said the staff report (CMR:377:05) stated residents
would pay the contractors for work performed and then request financing
from the City. She asked what guaranteed the residentsâ€™ loan options.

Mr. Marshall said a list of participating residents would be provided to the
Council for approval.

Vice Mayor Kleinberg asked what authority the Council had.

Mr. Marshall said Council was enabling staff to handle the special assessments
against the properties.

Vice Mayor Kleinberg said the Council would not have the authority to approve
or reject loan financing.

Mr. Marshall said once a resident was on the list they would receive the
financing.

Vice Mayor Kleinberg clarified the residents had a choice of financing.

Mr. Marshall confirmed.

Vice Mayor Kleinberg asked whether there was written assurance.

Mr. Marshall said loans would be provided as long as there was documentation
on what was spent on the undergrounding.

Vice Mayor Kleinberg asked whether there was information explaining the
process to customers.

Mr. Marshall said he would verify the information.       He was not aware of
anyone being denied a loan.

Vice Mayor Kleinberg was concerned if the County would charge the City to
carry the loan and then repay it.

Mr. Marshall said the program had been ongoing for years, and he was
unaware of any cost to the City from the County.

Vice Mayor Kleinberg said it was cost neutral as far as the County collection
and reimbursement of the monies was concerned.

Mr. Marshall said the City had not paid the County for that service.
