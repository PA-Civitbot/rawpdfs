Council Member Price said Recommendations 8 and 9 were critical
discussions with labor groups. If the City did not collaborate with labor
groups it could create more issues rather than reaching solutions that made
sense to the City.

Mayor Burt said the Council would now move on to Sections No. 10, 11, and
12.

Assistant City Attorney, Don Larkin said the City could respond to No. 13 but
was not specifically asked to respond to Nos. 10 and 13.

Vice Mayor Espinosa said Recommendation 10 and 13 were out of the Cityâ€™s
purview. The City Manager and Mr. Perez should respond to Nos. 11, 12a, c,
and d, since it concerned publicized meetings about the goals as well as
making sure the Council Members and the public were well informed. The
responses could be about what the City focused on during the past year.

Mayor Burt said the finding on No. 13 regarding Binding Arbitration was not
limited to San Jose.

MOTION: Council Member Scharff moved, seconded by Council Member
Holman to direct the City Attorney to draft a proposed Charter Amendment
and ballot language for August 2, 2010 regarding binding arbitration
whether to place this on the November 2010 Ballot.

Council Member Sharff clarified the vote was not to remove binding
arbitration but to have a discussion on August 2, 2010, and the only way to
do that was to request the City Attorney to draft a proposed Charter
Amendment and the ballot language.

MAKER AND SECONDER AMENDMENT to have a policy discussion
regarding the proposed Charter Amendment on July 26, 2010.
