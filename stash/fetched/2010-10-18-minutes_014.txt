Recreation Manager, Rob De Geus gave a brief explanation of the At-Place
memo placed before Council regarding the changes to the requested
contract.

Council Member Price asked if the flood control work needed to be
accelerated and if there were funds available to do so, would Staff need to
return to Council for approval.

Mr. De Geus stated a decision needed to be made on how the golf course
was maintained. The impacts of flood controls had on revenues was related,
but a separate question. The potential of Staff returning to Council due to
flood control would be a need for the contract to be adjusted and not a
request for funds in respect of the flood control issue.

Council Member Holman asked whether there had been changes made in the
movement of the levy.

Mr. De Geus stated the levy had encroached further into the golf course than
Staff had initially anticipated.
