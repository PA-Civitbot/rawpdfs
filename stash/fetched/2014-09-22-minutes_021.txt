MOTION PASSED: 9-0

9.   Rejection of Construction Bids for the Palo Alto Municipal Golf Course
     Reconfiguration Project and Adoption of a Budget Amendment
     Ordinance 5271 entitled “Budget Amendment Ordinance of the Council
     of the City of Palo Alto in the Amount of $708,495 in Revenues and
     $168,036 in Expenses to Operate the Golf Course From September 1,
     2014 to February 28, 2015, and Establish an FY 2016 Golf Course
     Operating Loss Reserve from the Net Revenue of Golf Course
     Operations in the Amount of $540,459 (Continued from September 8,
     2014).”

Rob de Geus, Community Services Department Assistant Director, reported
Staff had rejected all construction bids received on April 15, 2014 for the
construction of the Palo Alto Municipal Golf Course; however, Staff requested
the Council affirm that action. Staff requested Council direction to re-
advertise the project for competitive bids pending receipt of regulatory
permits.     Staff requested the Council adopt the proposed Budget
Amendment Ordinance (BAO) to keep the Golf Course open until
February 28, 2015 and to establish a Golf Course operating loss. The Golf
Course was operating under a modified layout due to the stockpiling of soil
needed for the Golf Course and levee projects. The number of golf rounds
and amount of revenue decreased because of the modified layout. Staff did
not anticipate the extended delay in obtaining permits. The General Fund
was currently subsidizing Golf Course operations. The number of juniors,
ladies, and seniors playing had increased; however, the total number of
rounds had decreased approximately 30 percent.             Soil importation
continued. If the full amount of soil was obtained, $1.3 million would be
available to support the project. The status of permitting was uncertain,
which resulted in the inability to rebid the project. The Staff Report
proposed a schedule to rebid the project in December 2014 and award a
contract in March 2015; however, Staff had little confidence in that
schedule. Staff recommended repeating the pre-qualification process in the
fall of 2014 to allow the bidding process to begin when permits were
received. As Staff, the San Francisquito Creek Joint Powers Authority (JPA),
and Council Members worked on permitting issues, Staff recommended the
Council adopt a BAO to increase revenues by $708,000 and expenses by
$168,000 in order to operate the Golf Course through the end of February
2015. Delaying construction would likely increase the costs of construction.
