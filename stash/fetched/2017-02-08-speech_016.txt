I am also very pleased to report that, after many trials and tribulations from permitting

agencies, the fully-renovated golf course will reopen this year. I donâ€™t play golf but I am

told by reliable sources that this will be the best public course between San Francisco

and San Jose while also significantly enhancing the ecology of the Baylands. The new

golf course will also reduce potable water use by 35% and add 10.5 acres to the

Baylands Athletic Center for other future recreational uses.




I also wanted to touch on the Byxbee Park Hills Renovation which is now 95%

complete. The project transformed the former landfill to parkland and it is a jewel. I run

there twice a week and it is simply amazing. I encourage everyone to go down to the

Baylands and enjoy it. A new trail system has been installed with miles of new trails.

There are new park benches, interpretive signs, a group meeting/seating area, and 4

native planting islands have also been added to enhance the visitor experience and

improve the habitat. I am also pleased to report that burrowing owls have returned and

have started using the site.




The Baylands Nature Center Facility Improvement project will be completed in March of

this year, and at the same time, staff will start to work on developing a Baylands

Comprehensive Conservation Plan. The plan will provide guidance on managing the

habitat, wildlife, and appropriate recreation at the Baylands Nature Preserve. The plan

should be completed in approximately 18 months.
