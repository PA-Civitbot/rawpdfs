INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH CONSENT OF THE MAKER
AND SECONDER for Staff to return to the Finance Committee with a clear
timeline within two months.

Vice Mayor Yeh emphasized the importance of proceeding with caution with
regards to the way the item was presented to the public.

Council Member Burt observed that the November 20, 2011 Finance
Committee minutes did not reflect an acknowledgement of the fact that the
Staff proposal being considered was inconsistent with Council approved
policy objectives. He suggested that it may have been an unconscious
oversight, but emphasized the need for increased awareness of how Council
functioned at a committee level to ensure strict adherence to Council
directives in the future.

MOTION PASSED: 6-2 Burt, Holman no, Price Absent
