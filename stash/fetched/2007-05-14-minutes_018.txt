AND SECONDER that there would be no admission fee charged unless for a
special event.

Council Member Kleinberg stated concern for the residence in the Museum
for security risk and the loss of square footage to the Museum.

Mr. Fellman stated the plans showed a space for a museum curator.

Council Member Kleinberg asked the total square footage allocated for the
space and the cost to convert the space.

Steve Staiger stated the idea was to provide 700 to 900 square feet of living
quarters to compensate for the low salary for a custodian.

Council Member Kleinberg asked why not rent the space to small non-profits.

Council Member Morton stated numerous other non-profit organizations in
City limits charge fees. The Council had restricted them to charging fees only
during special events.

Council Member Beecham stated their original intent was to charge only for
special events.

Mayor Kishimoto asked for specific timeframes for the Museum hours of
operation.

Mr. Fellman stated the CMR showed operation hours but the City was not
holding them to it since the Museum may want to expand the hours.

Mayor Kishimoto asked whether the Museum would be amenable to a
minimum number of hours for operation such as 20 hours per week.

Mr. Staiger stated the minimum number of hours was acceptable and the
days of operation would depend on the traffic flow for the Museum.

INCORPORATED INTO MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF MAKER AND
SECONDER that the Museum would be open to the public a minimum of 20
hours per week.
