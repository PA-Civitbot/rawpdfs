Council Member Shepherd suggested taking it from Council Contingency and
to do a review due to the increase in the High Speed Rail Committee Meeting
Agenda advertisements.

Vice Mayor Espinosa said he would not support the Motion. He said if the
Motion were approved he hoped the newspaper ad would be more user
friendly by indicating web links on where to obtain additional information.

Council Member Schmid was in favor of the Motion.

Council Member Scharff asked if the Boards and Commission Agenda ads
would continue if the Motion was not approved.

Ms. Grider said she could not answer for the other agendas since she was
only responsible for the Councilâ€™s and Standing Committee agendas.

Council Member Scharff asked if Staff was aware of other agenda
publications and costs.

Mr. Keene said he was not able to provide an answer.

Ms. Grider said the Architectural Review Board (ARB) and Planning and
Transportation Committee (P&TC) advertised their agendas.

Council Member Scharff said he supported the Motion.

Council Member Klein said he would not support the Motion. He felt only a
few people read the publication and become less in number since it was not
the way the new generation obtained information. He said other cities did
not advertise their agendas in newspapers and still had the same level of
public participation as Palo Alto. He said the Council should ask if the City
was getting $35,000 worth of public participation.

Council Member Yeh asked if there was a policy in place for record retention
if the City were to electronically publish and what posting would cost if it was
not published in the newspaper.

Ms. Grider said the on-line electronic posting was never removed and the
record retention could be added in to the policy.

Council Member Yeh said in January 2011 there would be a full on-line
agenda setting and asked how Staff envisioned the agenda posting.
