 DISCUSSION:
 The proposed project includes improvements within the public right of way (sidewalk and road) of a
 fully developed commercial area. Although the project is located in an area with expansive soils and
 has a high potential for surface rupture along fault traces and potential for earthquake-induced
 landslides where sloped, the project scope is limited to improvements at or near the existing grade and
 is anticipated to not be significantly impacted by the existing geologic conditions. The proposed
 project would not create any new geology, soils and seismicity impacts.

 Generally, the City of Palo Alto would experience a range from weak to very violent shaking in the
 event of a major earthquake along the San Andreas or Hayward fault. Although hazards exist,
 development would not expose people or property to major geologic hazards that cannot be addressed
 through the use of standard engineering design and seismic safety techniques, as required by building
 codes. With proper engineering new development is not expected to result in any significant adverse
 short or long-term impacts related to geology, soils or seismicity.

 Mitigation Measures: None Required
