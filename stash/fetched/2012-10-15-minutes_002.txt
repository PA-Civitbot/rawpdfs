Workerâ€™s Compensation and a pension reform package. He gave an update
on the San Joaquin Valley Browns Water Project and the proposed bond
measure. Assembly Member Gordon spoke about reform efforts for the
Regional Housing Mandate requirements, and the California Environmental
Quality Act (CEQA). He stated one of his main concerns is the State budget,

for discussion.
