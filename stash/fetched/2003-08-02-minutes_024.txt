Council Member Freeman said she believed she was informed by the
City Attorney that various streets were exempt from the conflict of
interest.

Ms. Furth was not familiar with an exemption pertaining to streets.
Both public and private improvements could be sources of conflicts of
interest.

Council Member Kleinberg clarified the suggestion was that the Council
would only do part of Channing or Homer Avenues.

Vice Mayor Beecham said the motion pertained only to SOFA 2
because Council Member Freeman might have a conflict in terms of
participating in a motion that affected a street that she lived on.

Mr. Emslie said the Council could not study only the streets within
SOFA 2.

Vice Mayor Beecham asked whether Council Member Freeman wished
to continue to participate.

Council Member Freeman asked the Senior Assistant City Attorney for
advice.

Ms. Furth responded that she did not know where Council Member
Freeman lived or the relationship of her house to the project.

Council Member Freeman said she lived on Channing Avenue between
Middlefield Road and Webster Avenue.

Ms. Furth indicated if Council Member Freeman lived on the portion of
the street where the traffic was being debated, the test was whether
there was any impact on the value of her home.

Council Member Freeman stated she would not participate in that
portion of the item due to a conflict of interest because she owned
property in the affected area.

Ms. Furth pointed out that there was no motion on the floor because
Council Member Freeman was not participating.

MOTION: Council Member Lytle moved, seconded by Kishimoto, that
staff return with a timeframe when the Council will address the two-
way direction on Homer and Channing Avenues.
