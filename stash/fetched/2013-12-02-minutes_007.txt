CITY MANAGER COMMENTS

James Keene, City Manager, announced the Utilities Department was
offering an exchange of up to two incandescent holiday light strings for
highly efficient LED holiday lights. The final phase of the University Avenue
tree maintenance was scheduled to begin December 4, 2013. Between
December 4-14, 2013 and December 17-21, 2013, Caltrain was expected to
work within its right-of-way.

Vice Mayor Shepherd inquired whether the Downtown parking limit would be
extended from two hours to three hours during the holidays.

Mr. Keene understood there were reasons not to change the seasonal
parking limit. He would provide clarification at a later time.
