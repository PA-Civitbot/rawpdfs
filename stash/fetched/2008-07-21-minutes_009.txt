staff.

Senior Financial Analyst, Nancy Nagel presented a brief synopsis of the plan,
cost   benefits,   work     divisions, guidelines  and    recommendations,
implementation periods, annualized costs and summarized the results and
savings to the City. She recommended the City move ahead with planning
and implementations of the following priorities: 1) Items that save the City
money. 2) Items that cost less than 50 dollars per ton. 3) Items that save
the community more than they cost the City. She said the report and
