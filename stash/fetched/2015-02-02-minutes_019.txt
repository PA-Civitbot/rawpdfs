Council Member Scharff wanted to move forward with FTTP as quickly as
possible.

Council Member Kniss would be embarrassed if the City did not move
forward. It was past time to do this.

Council Member Berman noticed that Google Fiber selected Nashville,
Tennessee, where the City's Former Mayor was the Co-Chief Innovation
Officer.

Mr. Reichental reported Google had not been forthcoming about the reasons
for its selections.

Mayor Holman asked if the City had to allow competitive service providers.

Mr. Fleming remarked that open access was only one business model among
several. The difficulty of the open access model was finding ISPs that could
provide service on a sustainable basis and that met consumer needs. The
open access model was difficult to execute in many ways. Networks in Utah
were required to operate under an open access model, and they had not
succeeded. In a retail model, the City would build and own the network and
provide services.

Mayor Holman requested Staff identify disadvantages, costs to customers,
and physical impacts when they returned with the study.

Council Member DuBois asked if a City-owned network with only one service
provider was a viable model.

Mr. Keene responded yes. That would be included in market analysis and
customer impact. Another model was the City controlling and managing
access.

Council Member DuBois asked if the City could outsource that role.

Mr. Keene answered yes.

Mayor Holman inquired whether that would be included in the Master
Planning.

Mr. Fleming advised that Staff asked the consultant to review all models in
the scope of work.
