DATE:               June 28, 2004

TO:                 City Council Colleagues

SUBJECT:        Accounting for Depreciation in the Operating Budget
________________________________________________________________

Recommendation

We recommend Council direct Staff to bring to the Finance Committee a
discussion of whether and how Palo Alto should include explicit depreciation
expenses in our Operating Budget. This discussion should be scheduled so that
subsequent policy decisions by Council can be implemented in the next two-year
budget.

Discussion

Our Operating Budget is presented in a form that is consistent with all standard
accounting practices for local government. These standard practices do not call
for including depreciation in the Operating Budget.

Depreciation represents the decline in value, or consumption, of assets including
infrastructure. Standard accounting practices for private corporations require
depreciation be recorded as an expense in corporate income statements. This
expense directly affects profit/loss (surplus/deficit) and indicates whether the
corporation is drawing down its resources without replacing them.

We should know at what rate we are consuming our infrastructure. We should
be sure we are setting aside adequate funds for maintenance and replacement.

Palo Alto has been progressive in the development and presentation of our
budget. We have been at the forefront of implementing the latest accounting
standards (GASB 34). We have doubled our annual capital expenditures over
the past five years and have committed $40 million to general fund capital
projects in the past four.
