Would the project result in substantial adverse
physical impacts associated with the provision of
new or physically altered governmental facilities,
need for new or physically altered governmental
facilities, the construction of which could cause
significant environmental impacts, in order to
maintain acceptable service ratios, response times
or other performance objectives for any of the
public services:
     a) Fire protection?                                         1                                                                  X

     DISCUSSION:
     The proposed project includes improvements within the public right of way (sidewalk and road) of a
     fully developed commercial area and does not encourage growth and development and is not
     anticipated to generate new users as to create impacts to the existing public services for the City.

     Mitigation Measures: None Required
