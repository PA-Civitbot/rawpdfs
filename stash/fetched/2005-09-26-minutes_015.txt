Council Member Kishimoto acknowledged the analysis of demographic data
from the Police Department was a complete report. She was happy the
Hyatt project had passed on the Consent Calendar, but she would have liked
to see retail on El Camino Real. Also, she would like to see the Service
Delivery Master Plan.

Council Member Mossar announced there was a San Francisquito Joint
Powers Authority Study Session to be held on October 5, 2005 at 6 pm at
the East Palo Alto City Hall. The Councils of Palo Alto, East Palo Alto, and

planning by the Army Corp of Engineers. The purpose was to make everyone

to the Bay Area totaling $80,000 for water issues.

processing facility in East Palo Alto. The contact person for information is
Cornelis Fletcher at 245-9016, and the deadline was September 28, 2005.

Council Member Beecham stated the Northern California Power Agency
(NCPA) Annual Meeting was held the past week. It was a productive year,

NCPA for the past two years and had done an excellent job.
