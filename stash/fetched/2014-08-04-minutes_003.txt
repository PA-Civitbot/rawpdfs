the parties reached a compromise for the design of the house at 808
Richardson Court. The effect of the appellant's withdrawal was that the
Director's decision would remain in effect subject to Staff's review of the
revised plans.

MOTION: Council Member Price moved, seconded by Council Member
Berman to remove Consent Item Number 12 from the agenda, due to an
amicable resolution reached by all parties.

MOTION PASSED: 8-0 Burt absent

Emily Renzel spoke regarding Item Number 4. She supported the City
Auditor's excellent Refuse Fund Audit. Some Council Members were pushing
Staff to proceed with a very expensive aerobic composting operation which
would consume a great deal of energy; would require a swap of the Refuse
Fund's valuable Los Altos Treatment Plant property for the compost facility;
would require the issuance of a $10 million bond; would replace a
landscaped habitat corridor; and would more than double the processing
cost. This made no sense given the sorry state of the Refuse Fund's
finances with a negative reserve and a huge Proposition 218 imbalance.

MOTION: Vice Mayor Kniss moved, seconded by Council Member Berman
to approve Agenda Item Numbers 3-11, 13-18.
