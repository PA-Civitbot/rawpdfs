MOTION: Council Member Shepherd moved, seconded by Council Member
Espinosa to accept Staff recommendation to approve the proposed Tentative
Map to create six residential condominium units at 382 and 384 Curtner
Avenue, based upon findings and conditions contained within the draft
Record of Land Use Action.

Council Member Schmid inquired about BMR units.

Mr. Williams did not recall whether a BMR was required in the original
application, but this was a continuation of that application.

Molly Stump, City Attorney, reported the extensive history of the project
included a representation by Staff that BMR would not be associated with
this project. Therefore, the voluntary settlement included a waiver of any
BMR that would be appropriate; given there was a substantial argument that
BMR could not be imposed in any case.

Council Member Schmid inquired if the other development fees were
included.

Ms. Stump stated the settlement agreement included a waiver of all
waivable fees with respect to this project.
