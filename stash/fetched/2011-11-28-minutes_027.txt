Ms. Stump confirmed the Staff Report indicated the Negative Declaration
was circulated between December 17, 2010 and January 18, 2011.

Council Member Klein asked if the previous circulation time was sufficient
and there was no need for a re-circulation.

Ms. Stump stated the interpretation of the court order was the substance of
the Negative Declaration and the procedure for posting and circulating was
not disturbed by the Judge; therefore, it was the view of the City Attorneyâ€™s
office that the Council could proceed with the adoption of the Negative
Declaration.

Council Member      Shepherd    supported    the   approval   of   the   Negative
Declaration.

Council Member Price supported the Motion and felt the process had been
completed appropriately.

Council Member Burt wanted to ensure the review of the Negative
Declaration was being treated in a diligent fashion. He had a question on
section PN as it was listed as a less than significant impact. He felt it would
be a positive impact. He asked why it was a slight negative rather than a
positive.

Mr. Williams said typically if it was not applicable, Staff noted it as less than
significant.

Council Member Burt confirmed it was an inclination on the side of caution.

Mr. Williams said yes.

Council Member Burt asked if Staff had reviewed the Mitigated Negative
Declaration again, item by item and were confident the determinations made
at the time when first circulated continue to apply across the board.

Mr. Williams responded yes, Staff had re-reviewed the document in its
entirety with particular attention to the traffic information and felt
comfortable with it.

Ms. Stump the mere passage of time did not require the work to be redone.
The standard in the code was that there did need to be further
environmental work when there was a new avoidable significant effect
