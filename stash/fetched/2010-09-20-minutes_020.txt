Council Member Klein stated Staff would need to return to Council in
sufficient time to enact the new rates to be in effect on October 1, 2011.

Mr. Keene accepted October 1, 2011 as the 12 month period. He clarified the
request to have the General Fund loan the Refuse Fund up to $840,000 may
not need to occur per the conversation Mr. Perez referenced had with the
State.

Mayor Burt stated given that Council would expect to have the Cost of
Service Study completed no later than January 2011 the assumption would
be to begin detailed public dialog in the Winter/Spring months.

Mr. Keene stated that was correct.

MOTION PASSED: 9-0

MOTION: Council Member Holman moved, seconded by Council Member
Schmid to recommence accepting commercial waste at the landfill.

Council Member Holman stated there was a revenue stream associated with
the commercial waste that could be garnished estimated at $500,000 to
$1.5 million annually.

Council Member Scharff stated the Finance Committee had extensive
discussions regarding recommencing commercial waste acceptance. His
understanding was with the acceptance of the commercial waste, the
anaerobic digestion facility would not be able to move forward.

Mr. Keene stated the landfill was a complex discussion that needed more
time than was available during this meeting. Staff had identified October 18,
2010 as a follow-up discussions on composting, landfill operations, future
landfill rent options and the landfill trickling closure issue.

Council Member Holman withdrew her Motion.

Mayor Burt asked the City Clerk if the Proposition 218 requirements had
been met.

Ms. Grider stated yes.
