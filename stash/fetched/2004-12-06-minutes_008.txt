REPORTS OF OFFICIALS

4.    Request for Council Direction to Proceed with Conceptual Design and
      Initiate a Combining Zoning District for the Civic Center Police (Public
      Safety) Building Project - Capital Improvement Program Project PE-
      98020

Council Member Morton stated he would not participate in the item due to a
conflict of interest because he had a client in the area where there might be
an impact.

Assistant City Manager Emily Harrison said the County Grand Jury Report
indicated serious concerns with the building and its safety for employees and
the work performed. She asked for the zoning change required to build on
the current building site and, also, for completion of the conceptual design to
finalize costs.

Police Chief Lynne Johnson said the building had not met the essential
facility standards for a number of years. Storage of safety equipment was
inadequate and unsafe. She provided a history of the project from the first
needs assessment in 1985 to date.
