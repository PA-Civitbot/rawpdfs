Norman Carroll, 3061 Emerson Street, stated the perception is that certain
people are not welcome in town and all of the encroachments should be
looked at or none at all.

Phil Lonardo, 774 Emerson Street, stated it is hard to impress the customers
at Whole Foods when what they see first are people begging for money. He
would support expansion of the Ordinance.

Council Member Mossar asked how the Sit/Lie Ordinance had been used in
the past and whether it had been effective.

City Manager Frank Benest replied this would be part of a continuum of
efforts.

Council Member Mossar asked in the past ten years how had the ordinance
been used.

Ms. Johnson stated without this Ordinance, the Police would not be able to
approach a citizen sitting on a sidewalk and ask them to move. The
Ordinance in place has not stopped the panhandling in that area but it had
helped.

Council Member Mossar stated Peet’s Coffee employees sit outside and take
smoking breaks.   She questioned if this would be a violation of the
Ordinance.

Ms. Johnson replied it would be if they were sitting on the sidewalk and
interrupting the flow of pedestrian traffic.

Council Member Mossar stated this also happened at Whole Food’s with their
employees sitting in the alley during breaks.

Ms. Johnson replied the alley would be okay.

Council Member Mossar asked why the Ordinance stopped at Channing
Avenue.

Ms. Johnson stated it was requested that Channing Avenue be included, but
there was not the level of pedestrian traffic to include it into the Ordinance.

Council Member Mossar stated that Ace Hardware employees regularly sit in
the alley and take smoking breaks. She stated the Ordinance made her
uncomfortable since it would not treat everyone the same.
