Foothill-De Anza Community College Trustee, Joan Barram, agreed they
wanted to come to a congenial agreement. She spoke to the many ways to
do high school and college activities together.

Council Member Shepherd agreed it was good everyone was working
together. She stressed everyoneâ€™s shared interest in public education and
city services. She asked what obligation the City had towards helping to
relocate the tenants if the Cubberley scenario moved forward.

Mr. Keene stated his preference was to add this question to the ongoing
question list. He noted there were many ways these obligations could be
defined.

Council Member Shepherd asked for clarification on the noticing option. She
asked if the School District had the same noticing option for the 27 acres
when they wished to reactive it into a school.

Mr. Keene presumed this to be correct.

Council Member Shepherd wanted to see the Trustees from Foothill-De Anza
and the PAUSD work through their difficulties.

Council Member Yeh stated he had many questions including what legalities
came into play with regard to locking in usages which extend far into the
future. He stressed the importance of crafting a plan which was fiscally
sustainable.

PAUSD Board Member, Camille Townsend, noted the schools were moving in
the right direction with the various Bond Measures. She agreed flexibility
was essential in moving forward. She noted the varying timelines. She
asked if it was true that Foothill-De Anza had 14 years in which to commit
their funds, but wished to do it sooner.

Mr. Allen stated it was not 14 years. The Bond program was structured in a
way that its capital portion was intended for execution in six to seven years.
Elements of the bond funding were related to long-term scheduled
maintenance and refresh programs.

Ms. Townsend asked where they were along this timeline.

Mr. Allen stated they were in year four.
