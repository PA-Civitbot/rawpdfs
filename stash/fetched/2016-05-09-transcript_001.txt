Mayor Burt:     Our first item is a Special Order of the Day which is
appointment of two candidates to the Human Relations Commission (HRC)
and two candidates to the Library Advisory Commission (LAC) and then
three candidates to the Utilities Advisory Commission (UAC) for terms
ending May 31st, 2019 as well as one candidate for the Utilities Advisory
Commission for one unexpired term ending May 31st, 2017. Would the
Clerk share with the Council on the final one, the Utilities Advisory
Commission, how the voting process works for the one single-year term
versus the three years.

Beth Minor, City Clerk: What you'd be voting on first is the three full-term
that will be expiring the end of this month. After that is completed, then
we'll do a final vote for the unexpired term on the UAC.

Mayor Burt: Thank you. We'll go ahead and do the first round of voting.
While the Clerk is tabulating that, we can go ahead and begin Agenda
Changes, Additions and Deletions.
