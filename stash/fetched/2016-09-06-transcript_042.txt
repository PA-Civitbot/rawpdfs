Mayor Burt: Vice Mayor Scharff.

Vice Mayor Scharff: Thank you. Following up on that a little bit. What are
we currently spending from the General Fund?

Mr. Alaee: That's a very timely question, because the City Manager was
asking that to me. Why don't I defer to my colleague, Ian Hagerman, who
has joined us all the way from Tennessee.

Ian Hagerman, Management Analyst: Good evening, Mr. Mayor, members
of the Council. Ian Hagerman with the Police Department. Our current
expenses in the Fiscal Year that just closed were about $1.5 million, $1.6
million. The net on that after revenue was a little over $1 million, just shy of
$1.1 million last year.

Mr. Keene: (inaudible)

Mr. Hagerman: That's correct.

Vice Mayor Scharff: At five and 20, we're saving $600,000 roughly, right?

Mr. Hagerman: That number includes animal control costs, which are
roughly $400,000 or $500,000 a year for those Staff. We would retain that
cost but the associated revenue from things that they provide.

Vice Mayor Scharff: Just to be clear, if we went with the $520,000 roughly,
the average cost, we're saving roughly $100,000 less and anything we save
off that $520,000. Is that fair?

Mr. Alaee: Repeat the question for me one more time.

Vice Mayor Scharff: What I heard is that—in the Staff Report it says the
threeyear average cost was $520,000, and the City's subsidy will stay below
$520,000. That's what I heard from that. The numbers I just heard from
you guys was it's $1.1 million, but $400,000, I think you said—$500,000 or
$400,000 was for the current animal control which will not go there. I was
just trying to do the math as you spoke. The numbers look like a savings of
about $100,000.

Mr. Alaee: For Fiscal Year '16, the animal shelter cost $515,997. For Fiscal
Year '15, it cost $523,702. For Fiscal Year '14, it cost $515,404. Those are
the exact costs for just the animal shelter services for the last three Fiscal
Years. Again, we're in discussions and negotiations with Pets in Need.
We're not there yet on a final amount. What we wanted to do tonight was
provide Council with the target which we're aiming for. Really trying to stay
under is our goal. There are other elements to the annual subsidy or the fee
