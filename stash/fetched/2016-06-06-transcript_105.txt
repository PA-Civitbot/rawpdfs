Mayor Burt: (inaudible)

Vice Mayor Scharff: They could relocate it if that's a problem.

Mr. Ah Sing: That's true, yes.

Vice Mayor Scharff: You didn't view it as a problem in terms of the access?

Mr. Ah Sing: Our transportation team had looked at that. There's potential
that it could be a spot that may not be as accessible.

Mr. Lait: There's different kinds of loading activities that take place. The
large car carriers is one, but there's also a parts department here. Those
parts deliveries take place in all kinds of different-size vehicles.     The
Transportation Department's review seemed that it was consistent with the
site orientation and site circulation.

Vice Mayor Scharff: What you're saying is, "We did look at it, and we found
it to be adequate."

Mr. Lait: Yes.

Vice Mayor Scharff: I guess the only other question on thisâ€”because "5" is
more of a comment than a concern, more of a comment than would be
Number 2, the car storage issue.

Mr. Lait: Correct.

Vice Mayor Scharff: On the car storage issue, you're going to get back to us
on that. You're going to take a look at it or do you need more time?

Mr. Ah Sing: A little more time on that, if I can.

Vice Mayor Scharff: That's fine.

Mr. Ah Sing: Thank you.

Vice Mayor Scharff: Maybe we can move on to regular questions if no one
else has technical questions.

Council Member Kniss: (inaudible)

Mayor Burt: (inaudible)

Council Member Kniss: Could I just finish my (crosstalk) ...

Mayor Burt: Yes, go ahead.
