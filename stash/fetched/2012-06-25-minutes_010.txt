                                  MINUTES
Mr. Williams noted Section 3 on page 4 reviewed all ARB Findings, and each
one was enumerated. ARB Finding No. 4 and ARB Finding No. 11 were not
applicable to this project.

Council Member Schmid inquired whether the housing condition in No. 11
was relevant.

Ms. French answered yes.

Mr. Williams stated it still applied.

Council Member Schmid asked if it was in the Council's discretion to grant
two concessions.

Mr. Williams replied yes.

Council Member Schmid indicated the first concession was increased FAR,
and asked what the second concession was.

Mr. Williams reported the concessions were onsite housing and FAR.

Ms. French said the FAR was reduced from the original amount.

Council Member Schmid asked if the Council had discretion to set the
number of housing units.

Mr. Larkin advised the number of housing units was set by Zoning
Ordinance. The Council did not have the discretion to reduce the number of
units or the concessions required. The Council did have discretion over the
ARB Findings.

Council Member Schmid indicated housing was a concession, but the Council
did not have control over the number of housing units.

Mr. Larkin reported the concession was mixed use rather than housing.
Housing and R&D were allowed on the site, but they were not allowed on the
site together without the concession.

Council Member Schmid inquired whether the site could be credited to the
Housing Element.

Mr. Williams responded yes. It was shown in the pending Housing Element
as a project in the queue and was counted as part of the inventory.
