ACTION ITEMS


9     Submittal of Mitchell Park Library and Community Center Monthly
      Construction Contract Report and Council Direction to Staff to Continue
      Construction Contract Monthly Reports.


City Manager, James Keene stated there was an electronic mail (e-mail) and
an addendum to the item “at places” that reflected recent change orders.


Interim Public Works Director, Mike Sartor stated this was the second in a
series of monthly reports for the project.   The first was in October 2012.
He said the project was presented to the Council in September 2012 and
that a number of project controls had been put in place as per the Council’s
direction.   The City Attorney had brought in experts to help with potential
change orders and claim issues. Additional training was conducted on field
order controls and change orders on the site.      Turner Construction had
brought in a senior-level person to help manage and control the project.


Assistant Public Works Director, Phil Bobel gave a brief update on what had
taken place since the last update in October.      Change Order #9 under
$200K, and Change Order #10 under $80K had been added.            He said a
summary of all change orders were listed in Staff Report ID#2242, page 2-
3, Table 1.    No change orders to the project had been made to attain a
Platinum rating. Staff and consultants did not foresee any change orders to
move the rating from Gold to Platinum.       He said a Gold rating could be
achieved by including more than the bare minimum of measures. The goal
was to attain a Gold rating and Staff was hopeful of achieving a Platinum
rating. Three new consultants had been hired to help evaluate the project.
Consulting firms and their costs were listed in Staff Report ID#2242, page 4.
