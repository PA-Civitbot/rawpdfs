      Roadway Segment LOS Analysis
      Like the Intersection LOS analysis, the Roadway Segment LOS analysis uses a similar letter
      grade scale but instead of focusing on delay time it measures volume demand against roadway

      every travel direction along California Avenue to accurately measure the effects of the proposed
      4-lane to 2-lane reduction on California Avenue.

         The average daily traffic volumes on California Avenue vary between 5,280 vehicles per day
         near EI Camino Real and 2,748 vehicles per day near Park Blvd. For reference purposes, Table 3
         below provides a comparison of traffic volumes of California Avenue against that of traffic in
         downtowns in neighboring cities.
