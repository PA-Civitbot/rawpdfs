Mayor Holman: Vice Mayor Schmid.

Vice Mayor Schmid: I agree that focus is important. As long as people keep
talking about Byxbee Park and other things, my understanding is the
easement on the ITT Federal Telegraph building is up in the air or will soon
be available. Just wanted to make sure that is mentioned.

Mayor Holman: Thank you. I have no cards from the public, nor have I
had. I see no other lights from Council Members. We have concluded this
item. Thank you.

Oral Communications

Mayor Holman: We go now to Oral Communications. I have no cards. Our
time now is at 7:43.

We'll be down to five Council Members at that point. We'll need to make
