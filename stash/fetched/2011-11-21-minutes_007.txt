Council Member Scharff stated that a 10 percent contingency should be
policy and any unforeseen work could be brought back to the Council on the
Consent Calendar.


Council Member Shepherd said she was in favor of decreasing the
contingency limit. She said contract audits, change order policies, and how
close original project estimates stay in line with the bid awards were part of
the City Auditor’s Office scope of work in the coming year. She supported
the Motion.


Mayor Espinosa asked City Manager Keene if there would be issues
regarding the recommendation.


City Manager, Jim Keene said contingencies were built on the variability of
factors and not always on the 15 percent contingencies. He said the project
was long-term. He did not see a problem with bringing items back on the
Consent Calendar. He recommended a study to see if there were correlations
between the current bid markets and bids coming in below job estimates.


Brian Schmidt, Water District Director, stated he had received information
from Santa Clara County’s (SCCO) former Water District Director Pat Ferraro
that the District considered funding similar types of backup well facilities in
the County and wanted to share the information with the Council and Staff.
