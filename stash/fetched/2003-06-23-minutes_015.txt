Council Member Kishimoto said, as the Stanford liaison, the job was to bring
forth the proposal. The process and minds would be open to improving the
proposal. She asked about the scoping session timeline.

City Manager Benest said when a consultant was hired, sometime within the
next month, a scoping meeting would be held.

Council Member Kishimoto encouraged working together with the Valley
Transit Association and CalTrain to make an integrated program.

Council Member Lytle said at the long-range future of the community needed
to be looked at. She asked what the entitlements were that would be
required to accomplish that, and would the property need to be rezoned.

Mr. Benest assumed the property would need to be rezoned.

Council Member Lytle asked if the soccer fields required rezoning or a
Conditional Use Permit (CUP) only.

City Attorney Ariel Calonne said the CUP might permit it, but rezoning could
be accomplished through the Development Agreement.

Council Member Lytle asked if Stanford would pay housing development
impact fees and would the commercial square footage generate impact fees
for park and recreation use.

Mr. Benest said the housing development would pay impact fees. He
believed the commercial development impact fees had been negotiated and
would be paid by Stanford.

Mr. Calonne said the Development Agreement stated the park impact fees
related to the vested square footage were paid by the dedication of Page
Mill/El Camino.

Council Member Lytle confirmed it would be for the 50 years.

Mr. Calonne said yes.

Council Member Lytle said the subcommittee called for another site to be
considered for park-dedicated land. She asked if the alternative site would
be considered in the Environmental Impact Report (EIR) for Stanfordâ€˜s
construction.

Vice Mayor Beecham asked to what subcommittee report she was referring.
