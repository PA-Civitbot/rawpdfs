Council Member Wolbach: That's fine.

Mayor Burt: Let's say that the purpose of the Committee as Whole meeting
would be ...

Council Member Wolbach: To address work plan and other areas of focus for
the Council for the year.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to add at the end of the Motion, “to address the
Work Plan, and other areas of focus for the Council for the year.”

Council Member Kniss: When is that going to be?

Mayor Burt: The final question is do we want to include in it a rough timeframe
to maybe occur before the end of March.

Council Member Wolbach: Yes. It could be sooner as far as I'm concerned.
We would put a Committee of the Whole meeting prior to the end of March.

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to add to the Motion, “prior to the end of March”
after “Whole Meeting.”

Council Member Filseth: On that question, the areas of focus like disposition of
Study Sessions and so forth, I can see. The work plan, isn't that really just the
responsibility of the City Manager? I want to make sure that we're not
overstepping the line between policy and oversight on this.

Mayor Burt: You're right, we probably should clarify that is to reconcile the
Council project priorities with the work plan. The City Manager wants that
feedback and prioritization of what our Priorities are so that they can then
integrate it in the work plan. Is that correct?

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to add to the Motion, “(to reconcile Council
project priorities)” after “Work Plan.”

Council Member Filseth: We haven't done that today?

Mayor Burt: No, but we got part way there. I mean, we did a dot exercise. If
they had nothing but the dot exercise, that helped them. Now I think what
they'll do is to say we saw your dots. Within those dots, we say we have this
many total man hours of the team that can work on this stuff. They may come
back and say we can do the 18 things that you had here plus five others or
they may say we can only do 13 of those 18.
