favor of Mr. Carlsen’s appointment but took exception to the two items
mentioned in the contract.

Assistant City Manager Harrison said the same auto allowance was
given to each department head. In terms of the housing subsidy, Mr.
Carlsen’s rental expense doubled when moving from Seattle into a
studio apartment in Palo Alto.

Council Member Morton said it was impossible to bring people here and
not provide a large housing supplement of low interest loans for
acquisition of a home or additional monies. He was in favor of the
appointment.

Council Member Freeman asked if a time limit could be placed on the
temporary living expense provision.

Ms. Harrison said the Management Compensation Agreement allowed
an indefinite extension. Mr. Carlsen had asked to limit it to one year
beyond the 48-month limitation but did not ask for a home loan or any
of the other available benefits stated in the contract. He chose to rent
rather than to ask for assistance in purchasing a home.

Council Member Freeman recommended approval of Mr. Carlsen’s
appointment and to modify Section 5.5.4 to limit the temporary living
expenses.

Vice Mayor Kleinberg questioned the authority to modify.

Mr. Benest clarified he followed the guidelines for benefits listed in the
Council-approved Management Compensation Plan, negotiated the
employment agreement, and made the appointment.

Council Member Freeman said Mr. Carlsen was an excellent addition to
the staff but raised concern regarding the continuation of perquisites
the City could not afford.

Council Member Beecham confirmed the continuous problem of having
to attract qualified people when affordable housing was difficult to find
in the Bay Area. He supported Mr. Carlsen’s appointment.

MOTION: Council Member Morton moved, seconded by Beecham, to
confirm the appointment of Russell Carlsen as City of Palo Alto Human
Resources Director.
