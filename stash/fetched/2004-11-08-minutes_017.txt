Vice Mayor Burch said moving forward would be a worthwhile effort. The
Blue Ribbon Committee specified what was needed. He suggested the
increase be $10.00.

Council Member Ojakian asked Mr. Roberts about the reserves.

Mr. Roberts said over the life of the program, the absence of a reserve was
not a flaw.

Council Member Ojakian asked whether it would be the first step to gain the
public faith by asking for money for the potential of future projects.

Mr. Roberts confirmed.

Council Member Ojakian said the community needed a chance to see the
way the project was structured.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION: Council Member Ojakian moved, seconded by
Burch, to approve the staff recommendation to direct staff to return on
December 6, 2004, to secure Council authorization for a property owner
election in February/March 2005 for approval of an increase in the monthly
Storm Drainage Fee to $10.00 per Equivalent Residential Unit (ERU) to fund
the proposed enhanced Storm Drain Program.

Council Member Ojakian said the storm drains needed to be repaired.     He
put a lot of confidence in the Blue Ribbon Committee.

Council Member Kishimoto said there was a specific plan as to what projects
were to be completed. There was enough information to go out to the
public.

Mayor Beecham proposed the amendment not have an annual fee
adjustment included.

Council Member Ojakian said he was comfortable with the motion he had
made.

Council Member Morton said the Council needed to provide the rationale for
the fee increase amount.
