Mayor Kishimoto stated the revisions to the Policy were guidelines and not
standards.

Council Member Morton stated the guidelines assisted staff with the
management of requests for Public/Private Partnerships.

Vice Mayor Klein requested revisions to the Policy. The paragraph on the
bottom of page two read: “Due to Government procuring and labor
requirements” and the proposed language was to delete that phrase. The
last sentence of the paragraph read: “The project must meet the approval of
the City Attorney and the City Manager or his/her designee.” and he
proposed the sentence be deleted.

City Manager Frank Benest said the City Manager carried out policy direction
from the City Council.

Vice Mayor Klein said that was not the stated language.

Mr. Baum said he hoped the Council would follow the advice of the City
Attorney and/or City Manager, but the Council always had the right to waive
the Policy.

Mayor Kishimoto suggested changing the language from “meet the approval
of” to “reviewed by”.

MOTION: Council Member Cordell moved, seconded by Morton, to approve
the Policy and Services Committee recommendation to update the City’s
Public/Private Partnership Policy.

Mayor Kishimoto verified the deletion of the phrase “due to Government
procuring and labor requirements.”

Vice Mayor Klein agreed that the motion was to delete the phrase.

INCORPORATED INTO MOTION WITH CONSENT OF MAKER AND
SECONDER on page 2 to delete the phrase: “Due to government procuring
and labor requirements…..” On page 3, first paragraph, delete the sentence,
“In these cases the project must meet the approval of the City Attorney and
City Manager or his/her designee.” Also, change phrase to “unless written
agreement approved by City Attorney has been made by the Alliance
organization……”

Council Member Cordell suggested the use of the word “reviewed” seemed
superfluous.
