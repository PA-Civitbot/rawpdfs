Vice Mayor Yeh asked why non-Palo Alto addresses were listed on the weed
abatement list.

Mr. Simpkinson clarified mailing addresses may be outside the city, but
parcels need to be within Palo Alto city limits.

Council Member Schmid said the list referenced weeds but addressed fire
issues.

Mr. Simpkinson said that was correct. The driving force behind weed
abatement was to address fire hazards associated with litter and abatement
of vermin and other hazardous conditions. Primarily it was for fire hazards.

MOTION PASSED: 9-0
