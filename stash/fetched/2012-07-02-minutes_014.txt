Mr. Bobel stated the three principal partners to the sewage treatment plant
were Los Altos, Mountain View, and Palo Alto. Any individual, major Capital
Improvement Program (CIP) project required individual approval and an
amendment to the agreement with partner cities.

Council Member Shepherd asked if Staff had presented these Items to City
Councilsâ€™ of the partner cities.

Mr. Bobel reported Staff had offered a presentation, but only Los Altos and
the East Palo Alto Sanitary District accepted.

Council Member Shepherd wanted to understand how the process worked.

Mr. Bobel indicated staff from partner cities had provided a great deal of
input.

Council Member Shepherd inquired whether Staff was concerned that
partner cities would not receive adequate information to make informed
decisions.

Mr. Bobel stated Mountain View had provided informational reports to the
Mountain View City Council as discussions occurred.

Council Member Shepherd inquired about contests of the Measure E vote.

Molly Stump, City Attorney reported a writ contesting the lawfulness of
Measure E had been filed. A decision should be issued later in the summer.
There was nothing to prevent the City from moving forward.

Council Member Shepherd inquired about integrating the slope into the 10
acres.

Mr. Bobel said it would be a challenging issue, because the 10-acre plot
would run into a steep slope. Staff was considering how to engineer that. A
Study Session was planned for November 2012.

Mr. Keene commented it was a challenge and an issue due to the number of
variables.

Council Member Espinosa stated more information was helpful for those
concerned about the financial feasibility of a proposed compost facility. Part
of true costs might be a combined facility or combined planning, and that
could influence the numbers.
