Maija McDonald, 4231 Park Blvd., spoke regarding open pathways via
bicycles and pedestrians throughout the project.

Herb Borock, P.O. Box 632, spoke regarding the project violating the
California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and the Below Market Rate
(BMR) unit ratio.

Elaine Breeze, SummerHill Homes representative, clarified that the Below
Market Rate (BMR) units requirement was less than the required acreage for
residential use.

Public Hearing closed at 7:52 p.m.

Vice Mayor Drekmeier asked for clarification on the bicycle and pedestrian
access ways to the park. He also inquired on the location of the park inside
the project.

Director of Planning and Community Environment Steve Emslie showed a
slide which graphically described the areas of access and park location.

Vice Mayor Drekmeier asked whether the access from Wilkie Way could be
shortened to the park rather than traveling completely around the single
family site.

Mr. Emslie stated the access from Wilkie Way went a distance into the site to
get to the park.

Vice Mayor Drekmeier asked the possibility of having a more direct route to
the park.

Mr. Emslie stated it was possible to modify the approved plan, however
there was a generous bike and pedestrian system inside the property.

City Attorney Gary Baum stated the project had no nexus that required the
Applicant to build or dedicate the park or access to it. If the Council wished
to require that as an option, staff needed to be directed by Motion to return
to a future meeting for Council direction.

Council Member     Kishimoto   asked   to   review   emergency   accesses   to
SummerHill.

Mr. Emslie stated staff was unable to verify the type of access required by
the Fire Department.
