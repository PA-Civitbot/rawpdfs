cap did not deal with the number of jobs, because a greater intensity of use
could be added into existing or new offices.

Vice Mayor Schmid agreed that large office developments did not appear to
contribute their fair share to funding of local government activities. This was
a method to identify a fee or tax that would garner their fair share.

Council Member Burt supported the concept; however, he was struggling
with including it in the Comprehensive Plan. A tax measure would likely be
placed on a ballot in the General Election in the fall of 2016, and the City
would not necessarily have a Comprehensive Plan at that time.

Council Member Kniss indicated the discussion was moving far afield. The
number of proposals were sufficient and she would not support any
proposals after the current ones.

Council Member Filseth did not believe the Motion addressed job growth or
the jobs/housing imbalance.

Council Member Scharff liked the concept, but he would not support it
because it had not been agendized. He preferred a fee on square footage
rather than employees.
