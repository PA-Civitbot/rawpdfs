That is noteworthy given what usually happens when chip sales surge in any given year, as was the case in 2010
when chip sales jumped 33 percent, said Ron Steger, a KPMG partner who specializes in the chip business. "If you
look at the history of the semiconductor industry, whenever you have a year of growth of 20 percent or more, it is
almost always followed by a year of double-digit decline," he said. Consequently, after seeing the survey results, he
added, "I was surprised."

Overall, about 90 percent of the executives surveyed said they expected some revenue increase and 39 percent
foresee their sales rising by 10 percent or more in 2011, said Gary Matuszak, another KPMG executive involved
with the study. In addition, 37 percent expect their profit to increase by more than 5 percent next year.

"That was pretty optimistic," Matuszak said, noting that many of the executives planned to expand their
operations in the United States, which suggests a significant number of their new employees will be added in this
country. Asked which market sectors they expected to boost sales of chips next year, 68 percent of the executives




                                                                                                                            Attachment: Attachment B: Economic Outlook (1371 : Sales Tax)
cited wireless communication devices, 62 percent energy-efficient gadgets and 38 percent automotive products. In
addition, 70 percent considered China the most important driver of chip sales in the next three years. But an
increasing number of executives see Europe and the U.S. as important sources of revenue, too.

Still, experts generally agree the remarkable growth in chip sales experienced last year is tailing off. While
worldwide sales for 2010 are expected to total $300.5 billion, an increase of 33 percent over 2009, the increase
should only be 6 percent in 2011 and 3.4 percent in 2012, the Semiconductor Industry Association predicted last
month.

UCLA Anderson Forecast

No quick fix to state's jobless.

California will remain stuck at a historically high unemployment rate for at least two more years and any recovery
will likely be spurred by the high-tech and health care industries, a report released recently says. By the time the
final three months of 2012 roll around, California should manage a jobless rate of 9.9 percent, the UCLA Anderson
Forecast said in a closely watched report. California's unemployment rate at present is about 12.4 percent. "It is
difficult to be very optimistic about the near term," said Jerry Nickelsburg, a senior economist with the forecast.
"On the job front, California has yet to make meaningful progress."

California must scale an economic Mount Everest. Since the recession began, the statewide employment loss has
been about 1.3 million jobs. Yet through the first 10 months of 2010, California has added 48,000 payroll jobs, or
an average of 4,800 jobs a month. Put another way, at that pace of per-month job creation, it would take 270
months, or more than 22 years, for California to get back to where it was in 2008 before the slump began. "These
are scary numbers," said Christopher Thornberg, a partner with Beacon Economics, which tracks regional
economies. "Things are in a bit of a mess." If job creation picked up to a robust 48,000 jobs a month, it would take
more than two years for California to reach its pre-recession heights.

Other economists think California must traverse an even more forbidding financial landscape. Jeffrey Michael,
director of the Stockton-based Business Forecasting Center at the University of the Pacific, said the state will not
achieve a jobless rate below 10 percent even by the end of 2012. "We see things as being even weaker," Michael
said. "The double-digit jobless rate in California will continue until the second half of 2013."

Among the key predictions for the UCLA Anderson Forecast:

    The unemployment rate, now at 12.4 percent, will drop to an average 11.4 percent in 2011 and an average
    10.3 percent in 2012, before dropping to 9.9 percent by the end of 2012.
