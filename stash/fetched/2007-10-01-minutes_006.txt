Ms. Merkes said the Downtown Library’s Technical Service’s wall would be
moved.

Council Member Morton asked whether the external space remained the
same.

Ms. Merkes said there was no addition, but Technical Services would have a
small expansion in order to accommodate the expanded Mitchell Park.

Council Member Morton said there was concern about the Main Library’s
historical standing. He asked whether the group rooms were add-ons.

Ms. Merkes said transparent boxes under the existing eaves were being
considered. The group study rooms would be enclosed glass boxes to
maintain the transparency and connection to the exterior, with very little
impact on the historic building.

Council Member Drekmeier said he liked the rooftop garden and the solar
roof and wondered if there was a reason why more of the roof space could
not be utilized for green projects.

Ms. Merkes said there was an opportunity to use photovoltaics.

Council Member Drekmeier asked whether the rooftop usable garden space
could be used in conjunction with the café.

Ms. Merkes said community gardens were valued in Palo Alto and it was an
opportunity to incorporate them in recreation programming as well as
training for gardening classes.

Council Member Mossar expressed concern that once Technical Services was
moved to the Downtown Library, it was part of a plan to close the Downtown
Library.

Library Director Diane Jennings said that was a concern among community
members but the Technical Services at Downtown Library was designed so
that it could easily be converted back to public space if the decision was to
move it to Mitchell Park Library.

City Manager Frank Benest asked if there was a policy commitment by the
Council to remove Technical Services at some point from the Downtown
Library or was it designed so it could be done as an option in the future.

Ms. Jennings said she believed it was the latter.
