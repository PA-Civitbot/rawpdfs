Mr. Emslie said it would be added.

Council Member Freeman asked if the property being discussed was
located on Homer Avenue between Emerson and Ramona Streets on
the north side of street.

Mr. Emslie said the house Council Member Freeman described was
zoned residential.

Council Member Freeman said she was confused because that property
would fall under any type of restriction unless isolated as individual
points.

Mr. Emslie said the property was zoned residential, which prevented it
from being converted.

Council Member Freeman clarified the current residential zoning would
override decisions made for the Homer/Emerson Corridor.

Mr. Emslie said that was correct.

Council Member Freeman asked whether there were any other
properties currently zoned that would not fall under the discussion.

Ms. Furth said there were multiple-family zones on the north side of
Homer Avenue between Ramona and Emerson Streets. The corner
closer to the Bay was RM-30 and the balance of the block that faced
the older houses was RM-15. Proposals were for the RT portion of the
corridors.

Council Member Freeman asked that the zoning be made more specific
in the Ordinance. She asked for the location of the houses that would
be exempt.

Vice Mayor Beecham said the address was 731 Emerson Street.

Council Member Ojakian said the house that was exempt was 731
Emerson Street, and the three other units were 929, 933 and 949
Emerson Street.

Council Emslie said it was south of the building commonly referred to
as Old Indian Bowling Alley on Emerson Street.
