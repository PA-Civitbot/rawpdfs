path? You said it wasn't a waste because there was a bike path that hooked
into it. Where did that come from? How did that work?

Mr. Mello: Ross Road is a bike boulevard, and you actually just approved
the final design contract for that in April. We're actually moving forward
with designing and constructing the Ross Road Bike Boulevard. Later this
year, we're going to be bringing forward the Greer Road Bicycle Boulevard.
You would connect to two north-south corridors that would distribute people
throughout the Midtown community and connect them to the trail segment
at Ross Road.

Vice Mayor Scharff: What this really would do is take you between the Ross
Road Bicycle Boulevard and the Greer Boulevard.

Mr. Mello: And on to the Baylands.

Vice Mayor Scharff: Assuming we do the under-connect.

Mr. Mello: Yes.

Vice Mayor Scharff: If we did the under-connect, it's only operational six
months a year. Is that correct? Maybe longer.

Mr. Mello: I think we open in April and close in October.

Vice Mayor Scharff: If we move forward with this, what would we spend to
do the engineering in that for the seasonal undercrossing or would we not
start that right away?

Mr. Mello: Environmental work for the seasonal undercrossing would beâ€”
these are very conservative estimates. We wouldn't know until we went out
to bid and came back with a contract. Fifteen percent of the construction
cost is $225,000.

Vice Mayor Scharff:   We'd spend the $225,000 and the $150,000 upfront.
That's the ...

Mr. Mello: We'd spend $225,000 on environmental, and then an additional
$225,000 on final design, and then construction is $1.5 million for the
seasonal undercrossing.
