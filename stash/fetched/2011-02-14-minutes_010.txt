Mr. Larkin stated Staffâ€™s proposal was to make a commitment to pay
$3 million by means of the Affordable Housing Fund. Staff would be
required to find an alternative way to recoup the Affordable Housing
Fund if needed. He did not anticipate using the General Fund.

Council Member Schmid inquired whether any other funds backed-up
the Affordable Housing Fund.

Mr. Larkin stated no.

MOTION: Council Member Klein moved, seconded by Vice Mayor Yeh
to:

1)    Approve Amendment No. Four to the Alma Street Affordable
Multifamily Rental Housing Project Acquisition and Development
Agreement to loan $2.8 million of Housing Funds to the project for
predevelopment, construction and permanent project costs and to
commit up to an additional $3.0 million of Housing Funds for
construction and permanent loan funding for the project. Attached to the
loan agreement are two Promissory Notes and a Deed of Trust for both
loans; and

2)   Authorize the City Manager or his designee to execute the Loan
Agreement referenced above and all documents necessary to implement
the Agreement, and direct the City Manager or his designee to
administer the provisions of the Agreement; and

3)   Authorize the City Manager or his designee to execute an
amendment to the existing $3.5 million loan documents to conform the
terms of that loan to the terms of the new $2.8 million and $3.0 million
commitment.

Council Member Klein stated his intent was to ensure that the public
was aware of the Project. Realizing financial encumbrances, the
Council had a social obligation to provide affordable housing in the
community. He felt the Project was a reasonable request and should
move forward.

Vice Mayor Yeh spoke on moving forward to be competitive with the
tax credit financing to ensure sufficient funding was locked in place.

Council Member Price stated the Project had tremendous merit.
