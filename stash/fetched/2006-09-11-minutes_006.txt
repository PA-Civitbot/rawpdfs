CONSENT CALENDAR

MOTION: Council Member Mossar moved, seconded by Klein, to approve
Consent Calendar Items Nos. 4 through 20.

MOTION: Council Member Klein moved, seconded by Cordell, to remove
Item 13 to become 20A.

Council Member Cordell registered a no vote on Item Nos. 5 and 10.

Council Member Morton registered a no vote on Item Nos. 5 and 10.

(P&TC). Staff found the guidelines significant enough to recommend the
PTOD be applied to 195 Page Mill Road. The PTOD would enhance the
housing opportunity, as well as create transitions to promote a harmonious
coexistence with the surrounding area.

Council Member Mossar asked whether the existing project had been

Mr. Emslie said the application was in process but it did not conform to the
current zoning or the proposed PTOD and would be referred to the Council.

Council Member Morton asked whether the PTOD application was non-
