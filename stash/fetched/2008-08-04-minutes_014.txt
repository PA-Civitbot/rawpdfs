MOTION PASSED: 9-0

14d. (former No. 14A.) Adoption of an Ordinance Amending Section
     2.04.070 (Agenda) of Title 2 (Administrative Code) to Eliminate the
     Printing of the City Council Agenda in a Newspaper of General
     Circulation.

Mayor Klein stated the members of the public would speak first to this
Agenda Item.

Angelica Volterra, PO Box 1724, urged Council to reject the item as the
Councilâ€™s published agenda was a weekly reminder to the community of the
workings of city government and an open invitation to attend the Council
meeting.

Herb Borock, P.O. Box 632, requested the Council not support the item as
the publishing maintained civic engagement and kept the community abreast
of the Council actions.

Robert Moss, 4010 Orme Street, urged the Council not to support the item
and stated the dollar amount was a minimal charge when compared to the
overall city budget.
