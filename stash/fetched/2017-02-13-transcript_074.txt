back with a proposal to avoid that. Again, I would just say 2 percent
vacancy, we're doing very well Downtown. I'd like to find some places
maybe for better locally serving retail. Thanks.

Mayor Scharff: I have a bunch of questions. The Staff Report talks about
pipeline projects. The Ordinance has been 2 years. We have pipeline
projects still?

Mr. Lait: There's actually, I think, only one pipeline project. That is going
