you to the City Manager for signing with Max McGee from the School District
the agreement on Cubberley. Thank you for that.

Mayor Burt: Finally, Vice Mayor Scharff.

Vice Mayor Scharff: Mayor Burt dealt with the FAA select committee. Just
briefly I'll also say when we were back there for the National League of
Cities, I also attended a number of meetings for our Utilities Department and
also for Northern California Power Agency (NCPA) and also for the American
Public Power Association (APPA) as well as that.

Mayor Burt: On that note, the meeting's adjourned.

Adjournment: The meeting was adjourned at 11:20 P.M.
