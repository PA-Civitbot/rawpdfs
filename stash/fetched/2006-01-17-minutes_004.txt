     8.08.010 of the Palo Alto Municipal Code, Constitute a Public Nuisance,
     which Nuisance Must be Abated by the Destruction or Removal
     Thereof.

Mayor Kleinberg said Resolution 8575, declaring weeds to be a nuisance,
was publicly noticed and no one appeared or filed written objections against
the weed abatement proceedings.

City Attorney Baum said Stanford University was on the weed abatement
notice and he advised the two Council Members with potential Stanford
conflict to not participate.

Council Member Cordell stated she would not participate in the item due to a
conflict of interest because she was employed by Stanford University.

Council Member Mossar stated she would not participate in the item due to a
conflict of interest because her husband was employed by Stanford
University.
