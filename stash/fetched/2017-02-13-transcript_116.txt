Mayor Scharff: I would say anything over—I'm fine with anything over
5,000 square feet. This would only apply to stuff under 5,000 square feet.

Council Member DuBois: Greg, could you clarify? It's going to say fitness or
exercise studios of 5,000 feet or less?

Mayor Scharff: Correct. Does Staff get that? It would say fitness and
exercise studio or similar uses of 5,000 square feet or less.

Mr. Lait: Do I hear that that's the request?

Mayor Scharff: Yes. That's fine with you, Adrian?

Council Member Fine: Yes.

AMENDMENT RESTATED: Mayor Scharff moved, seconded by Council
Member Fine to add to the Motion, “replace Section 18.040.030(114)(H)
with, ‘fitness and exercise studios or similar uses of 5,000 square feet or
less.’”

Mayor Scharff: Council Member Holman. Let's vote on the board.

Council Member Wolbach: Can I take a look at it before (inaudible)?

Mayor Scharff: Sure. I didn't mean to move too quickly. It shouldn't say
anything about … Just for the Clerk's Office, it should read replace "H" with
fitness and exercise studios or similar uses of 5,000 square feet or less.
That's all it needs to say.

Mr. Shikada:    Mayor and Council Members, Staff would like to offer
perspective in terms of context.      The 5,000-square-foot threshold has
sparked some impression that it is a large threshold.

Mr. Lait: For a City that's consistently been regulating these types of
facilities with a conditional use permit at midnight to switch that to 5,000, it
may be doable, but I …

Mayor Scharff: I'll go with 2,500. How's that?

AMENDMENT RESTATED: Mayor Scharff moved, seconded by Council
Member Fine to add to the Motion, “replace Section 18.040.030(114)(H)
with, ‘fitness and exercise studios or similar uses of 2,500 square feet or
less.’”

Vice Mayor Kniss: A bargain.
