AMENDMENT: Council Member Lytle moved, seconded by Freeman, to
make childcare a permitted use in general manufacturing districts and
restaurants a permitted use in medical office zones.

Mr. Williams noted that childcare was permitted in all zones except for GM.
Restaurants were conditional use permits (CUP) in all the zones except for
the medical office zone.

Council Member Freeman said RP had permitted use for childcare and CUPs
for restaurants. Staff was asked what the benefit was of making restaurants
permitted uses.

Council Member Lytle said the intent with the Comp Plan was to allow uses
to mix, particularly in the area around El Camino Real.

Council Member Freeman was concerned that the Research Park was
separated into two segments: one segment was further to the foothills and
one segment was closer in. The new RP considered that. By giving a
permitted request for restaurants, a restaurant could be added without a
CUP.

Council Member Lytle preferred to see the change in the area that currently
had a constrained use.

Council Member Freeman said she would withdraw her second to the motion.

MOTION DIED FOR LACK OF A SECOND

Council Member Ojakian hoped staff and the P&TC took a further look at the
issue to see a value and benefit. Restaurants were previously housed in the
Research Park and were popular.

Council Member Kishimoto said the City did not want the area to become a
restaurant row. A square footage limit might be considered.

AMENDMENT: Council Member Lytle moved, seconded by Kishimoto, that
site and design standards with housing and mixed uses to ask Planning and
Transportation Commission to consider shifting some of the current
development intensity from the far reaches of the research park toward the
California Avenue and El Camino Real business district.

Council Member Lytle said       the   motion   encouraged   more   compact
development and less sprawl.
