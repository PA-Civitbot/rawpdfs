Council Member Schmid asked if there was an ongoing gap averaged
throughout the year.

Mr. Rossmann responded yes.

Mr. Keene clarified that the expected salary savings due to the gap was
expressed within each department.

Council Member Schmid asked if there was a gap between what was stated
in the Budget and what was paid on a current basis.

Mr. Rossmann replied yes.

Council Member Klein commented that Staff utilized the Cost of Service
Study as a tool to make decisions on fees and to analyze the Budget. He
inquired whether Staff requested Council approval of anything in the Cost of
Service Study.

Mr. Rossmann answered no.

Council Member Klein indicated the Finance Committee spent a good deal of
time understanding the Cost of Service Study. He suggested a Study
Session to inform the remainder of the Council.

Mr. Rossmann reported the Finance Committee directed Staff to do that.
Staff proposed to return to the Council when a Municipal Fee Schedule was
submitted as part of the FY 2015 Proposed Budget process.

Council Member Klein asked when that would occur.

Mr. Rossmann had not scheduled it, because he wanted to complete the
Municipal Fee Schedule first. It could occur in June, but most likely in
August 2014.

Council Member Klein inquired whether parts of the Cost of Service Study
were reflected in the Proposed Budget.

Mr. Rossmann indicated the Proposed Budget requested funding to continue
to support the Cost of Service Study.

Lalo Perez, Chief Financial Officer, indicated the Cost of Service Study would
have the largest effect on Development Services and the Community
Services Department (CSD). Staff requested an additional position in CSD
to perform an in-depth analysis of fees for which the Council might consider
a policy change regarding the level of cost recovery.
