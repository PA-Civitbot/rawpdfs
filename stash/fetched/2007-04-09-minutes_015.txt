newspaper to give the public opportunity to respond. There have not been
any notices.

Mayor Kishimoto asked whether the residents would be advised before the
construction of the boxes began.

Mr. Kolling stated there would be a requirement that the company would
have to give notice and the staff would review the notice before it went out.

Mayor Kishimoto asked whether the notice would go to the ARB or the
     residents.

Mr. Kolling stated it would go to the homeowner who would be immediately
affected by the box and the neighbor directly across the street.

Council Member Beecham confirmed that staff retained the discretion to
control the boxes even though they would be limited by State law.

Mr. Kolling stated that would be correct.

Vice Mayor Klein asked what was being done about the boxes being put
above ground when there are underground utilities.

Mr. Kolling stated there is a provision in Chapter 12.16 dealing with
underground districts that stated they are not required to use underground.

Council Member Kleinberg questioned the underground cable boxes.

Mr. Kolling stated the City of Palo Alto might be one of the few cities that
had an exemption for the telecom facilities.

Council Member Kleinberg stated the City paid extra for it to be
undergrounded in some neighborhoods.

Mr. Kolling stated he was unaware of any facilities that had been
undergrounded.

Mr. Roberts stated that is historically correct. The technology in all the
industries has changed and is moving away from underground vaults due to
equipment not being available anymore to be placed in underground vaults.

Mayor Kishimoto asked whether he was referring to Chapter 12.16.010 of
the underground language where it states it can be above ground if the
Director determines that installation underground is not feasible or practical.
