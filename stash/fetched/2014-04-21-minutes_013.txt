Council Member Holman thanked Mr. Martinez for serving on the Planning
and Transportation Commission. Mr. Martinez was intelligent, gracious,
thoughtful, and forthright.

Eduardo Martinez thanked the Council for the honor. The City needed to
reinvent the Architectural Review Board (ARB) in that Board Members did
not criticize other architects or made only marginal comments.         He
recommended every project begin with a site plan and a program from the
applicant and a discussion with the ARB about neighborhood character. If
the community could suspend its beliefs and consider developments without
preconceptions, then it would come closer to coming together as a
community.

MOTION: Council Member Schmid moved, seconded by Council Member
Klein to adopt the Resolution expressing appreciation to Eduardo Martinez
for his service on the Planning and Transportation Commission.

MOTION PASSED: 9-0
