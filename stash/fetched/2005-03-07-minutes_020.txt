Jaime Wong, 1849 Webster Street, urged Council not to continue with the
appeal hearing.

Greg Lee, 1012 Forest Avenue, asked Council to uphold the IR approval.

Drew Maran, 731 Lincoln Avenue, opposed the appeal.

Jarcon Tsang, 3493 South Court, supported the IR and opposed the hearing.

Elizabeth Wong, 1849 Webster Street, urged Council to not hear the Reece’s
appeal.

Herb Borock, P.O. Box 632, disagreed with the process of requiring four
Council Members’ votes whether there was the minimum quorum of five or
all nine Council members present. When changes were made to the review
process and other processes in the Zoning Code, it was referred to as
“streamlining.” It was streamlining for the applicant. There was a need to
balance the public with the applicant and the debate did not occur.

Ann Hawkinson, 3541 Emerson Street, stated a public hearing was
necessary for the project because proper notification was not made.

Council Member Beecham opposed the hearing, but would recommend a full
hearing by Council without public testimony.

MOTION: Council Member Beecham, seconded by Burch, to deny the
appeal.

Vice Mayor Kleinberg said the Planning Department received criticisms
regarding the processing of the project and gave the Planning Department
an opportunity to state what had been completed in terms of the notification
process.

Mr. Emslie said the project records had been reviewed by him and by the
City Attorney. Evidence showed ample and proper notification was given at
all phases of the project. He said multiple notifications are given at the
beginning of the process, notices to establish comment periods, and notices
to determine when decisions were made. He would be glad to look into any
concerns or lack of notification or communications that were not given.
