approved in 1956. The public must be shown that what was being proposed
was comparable to what was being done in other cities. In 2002, the
Childrenâ€™s Library was included, whic h would not be the case now. A
National Survey reported that 78 perc       ent of Palo Alt o residents were
satisfied, or somewhat satisfied, with the libraries. It was unknown what the
community thought about a new publi c safety building and improvements to
the library system.

City Attorney Gary Baum noted the Ci     ty is allowed to poll but c   annot do
advocacy polling.

Mayor Kleinberg requested staff to a     ddress the following issues for th   e
meeting next week: 1) whether polling is done for both projects, advising
funding f or both projects and w hat i t would c ost the public; 2) space and
collection for seniors as the Baby Boomer generation begins retiring; 3) t he
timeline for the project and what parts of it could be combined, expedited
etc.; 4) staff input about form following function and how muc h the function
should be looked at with respect to the form; and 5) discuss this project as a
community asset; it is not about where the project is located in the City.
