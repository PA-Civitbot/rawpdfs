MOTION: Council Member Morton moved, seconded by Beecham, to
approve the Resolution Amending the Salaries of Three Council Appointed
Officers and Approval of Amendment 2 to the Employment Agreement with
City Manager Frank Benest.

Council Member Morton said the City Manager had an excellent reputation as
a teacher and consultant. The City Manager would give his full energy and
commitment to the City. His teaching and consulting would enhance his
skills and the reputation of our community.

City Attorney Gary Baum said there was not a conflict of interest issue under
the City Charter.

Council Member Beecham said the Council who selected City Manager Benest
were aware of his talks at conferences and conventions.

Herb Borock, P.O. Box 632, said what was written in the City Manager’s
employment agreement was different from what had been occurring the past
four years.

Council Member Mossar said it was known the City Manager had participated
in the activities. It was important for the community to be networking with
other communities. The City Manager was asking for clarification in his
contract.

Council Member Kishimoto said the change made to the City Manager’s
contract clarified the paid activities he would be involved in would be during
vacation and leave time.

Council Member Freeman said she had no prior knowledge of Mr. Benest’s
outside compensation while employed as the City Manager of Palo Alto.

Council Member Cordell said the discussion assured the public the Council
was open about everything that occurred. She concurred with the City
Attorney’s interpretation, which supported Mr. Benest to engage in other
employment.

Mayor Burch said all Council Members were subject to agreements,
ordinances, and laws passed by previous councils.

MOTION PASSED 8-1, Freeman no.
