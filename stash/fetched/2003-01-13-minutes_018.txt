Council Member Kishimoto expressed concern that Form Code and Urban
Code led to a much higher density for Palo Alto. If Form Code was applied in
a particular zone, it did not automatically lead to a higher density, but
hopefully a better design.

INCORPORATED INTO MOTION WITH CONSENT OF MAKER AND
SECONDER to add the following:
  • Address environmental standards including permeable areas
  • Accommodate trees
  • Review new ways to address massing and volume
  • Report on transit-oriented development, especially parking
  • Review residential compatibility
  • Consider noise impacts
  • Review second unit issue mandated to develop appropriate Form Code
    (State legislation)
  • Provide sense of areas on a map where different Form Codes would be
    suitable
  • Provide real examples of good development reflecting goals of the
    Form Code
  • Consider on-site guest parking to be included in development
    standards
  • Consider issues of preservation of view corridors, exploring and
    explaining daylight plane, massing, and setbacks

Mr. Emslie said the consultants had indicated the prototypes would not result
in significant amounts of new density, because the Form Code was finely
grained. Staff did not anticipate dramatic increases in the number of units
possible on a typical lot.

Council Member Kleinberg suggested asking the consultants to follow current
zoning for purposes of the form studies, and then conduct discussions of
proper form densities at another date.

Council Member Lytle said she did not believe it was possible to design
structures without knowing the number of units to accommodate.

MOTION PASSED 8-0, Beecham absent.

MOTION: Council Member Lytle moved, seconded by Burch, that Phase II
look at development that would maintain current intensity and massing with
opportunities to examine new density.

Planning and Transportation Commissioner Patrick Burt said his
understanding of the Planning and Transportation Commission (P&TC) was
to attempt to recommend to the Council modifications to the Zoning
