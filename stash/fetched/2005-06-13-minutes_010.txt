Gerardo Lombera, 436 Warrington Avenue, Redwood City, said the
gardeners were educated to properly operate gas blowers and would like an
extension to respond with a better solution.

Carolyn L. Curtis, 531 Alger Drive, said progress needed to be made
regarding the community’s pulmonary health.

David Vick, 323 Manzanita Avenue, said airborne particulates created a
health hazard.

Council Member Morton asked whether the opinion of the community would
be clearer in six months.

Ms. Johnson said the six-month recommendation was to allow for wording
changes in the ordinance and to share the changes with the general public.

Council Member Morton said, currently, commercial properties would be
exempt but City properties would not be exempt. The increase in cost to the
City would be $2 million.

Assistant City Manager Emily Harrison said staff recommended a lower level
of cleanliness in the City’s parks.

Council Member Morton said the City could be exempted; the ban would only
be residential. He asked what would it cost to add a measure on the
November ballot.

Ms. Rogers said a measure on the November ballot would cost approximately
$50,000.

Council Member Morton felt it would be beneficial to spend $50,000 to obtain
the opinion of the community. It could be added to the ordinance that
residents should hire only certified gardeners.

City Attorney Gary Baum confirmed it could be a legal option.

Council Member Morton said he did not believe there should be a ban on gas
leaf blowers.

Council Member Kishimoto said the Council reached a compromise five years
prior. She felt additional enforcement was needed.

Council Member Beecham said if no action was taken, what would be banned
as of July 1, 2005.
