Council Member Lytle asked why the decision was made to remove the items
for additional research.

Mr. Benest said items are removed often, as staff wanted to be responsive
to Council the best way possible. If there were a series of questions from
Council Members on a Monday, staff will remove the items until direction
was given on how to handle the situation.

Council Member Lytle asked if that was a new practice.

Mayor Mossar said staff advised that items were removed all the time and
she did not want the practice changed. Again, she asked if the practice was
correct.

Ms. Harrison said it was correct.

Council Member Morton expressed his frustration over one or two Council
Members initiating major research projects requiring hours of time and
Council could not make a determination on whether or not it was a good
utilization of staff’s time. He said questions should be public and return to
Council as part of the information. He moved that staff not engage in those
projects or to have the questions made public.

Mr. Benest proposed staff would provide answers to questions brought up on
those items and, if additional research was required, staff would wait for
Council’s direction.

Mayor Mossar said she was uncomfortable with resolution on the matter
since it was not an agendized item.
