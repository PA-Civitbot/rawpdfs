                     ACTION MINUTES
A.   Cumulative Cap:

     Policy L-1.10 would maintain a Cumulative Cap of 1.7 million square
     feet, which is the square footage remaining under the existing cap,
     focus the Cap on Office/R&D uses and apply it citywide rather than
     only in “monitored areas.” It would also exempt medical office uses in
     the Stanford University Medical Center (SUMC) area (the current Cap
     does not apply to this geographic area), and require annual monitoring
     to assess the effectiveness of development requirements and
     determine whether the Cap and the development requirements should
     be adjusted; and

B.   Annual Limit:

     Direct Staff to make permanent the Annual Limit Ordinance of 50,000
     Square Feet, separate from the Comprehensive Plan Update; and

C.   Downtown Cap:

     Eliminate the Downtown Cap found in existing Program L-8 and focus
     on monitoring development and parking demand.
