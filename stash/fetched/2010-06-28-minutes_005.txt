Mr. Roberts stated yes. He spoke on the rigorous process of requiring
potential bidders to become prequalified and attend mandatory pre-bid
conferences which discussed the nature of the Bond Project. He stated
construction on a 50-year old building would likely have unforeseen
conditions and flexibility was necessary.

Council Member Holman inquired whether a 27 percentage rate for oversight
was a typical rate for a project of this magnitude.

Mr. Roberts stated yes.

Council Member Schmid concurred with the comments made by his
colleagues, and congratulated Staff for receiving the Bond Project funding.

Mayor Burt stated the bid was 25 percent below the Engineer’s estimate. He
inquired when the Engineer’s estimate was made.

Mr. Roberts stated the Engineer’s estimate was prepared between the Fall of
2009 and Spring of 2010.

Mayor Burt inquired whether the Engineer’s estimate contained adjustments
that took into consideration the current economic downturn.

Mr. Roberts stated that was correct. He stated many contractors were
bidding projects at their cost to stay in business and keep crews busy.
