Council Member Kishimoto encouraged applying for the PC that was for
both the 100 percent rentals and BMRs and bonus areas.

Council Member Lytle said the housing potential in SOFA was to be
used where it would not be conflicted between historic businesses and
the transit-oriented housing. The focus should be density incentives
on the three parcels staff had stated had good potential and did not
conflict on all the other buildings the property owners wanted to keep
and restore. Property owners should be allowed to add a unit here
and there to their project if they could and still retain national
standards. The Council did not envision SOFA 2 as being high-density
transit-oriented housing except on a few vacant properties like 800
High Street. The closer they got to Alma Street the better it was for
higher density parcels, and the further away from Alma Street, the
more concerned she was about high-density parcels.

Vice Mayor Beecham clarified that was how the RT-50 and RT-35 were
laid out.

Council Member Burch noted in Appendix A there were five points
listed and, in the chart, only four. Projects eligible for PC zoning were
left off.

Mr. Emslie said staff dropped the fifth bullet thinking it was redundant,
which made the idea unclear.

Vice Mayor Beecham said as the Council moved forward, they were
working from the staff report (CMR:386:03) and not from the
presentation. Anything that needed to change in the presentation
needed to be reflected in the report.

Council Member Kishimoto said it was 1.15 FAR for RT-50 without a
bonus plan.

Mr. Emslie said it was a base of 1.15 FAR for RT-35 and 1.5 FAR for
RT-50.

Council Member Kishimoto said the base FAR without the bonus was
1.15 FAR in SOFA 2.

Mr. Emslie said it was a base of 1.15 FAR for RT-35 and 1.5 FAR for
RT-35 and 1.5 FAR for RT-50.
