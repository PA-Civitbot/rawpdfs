that back in October of 1989, when the video booth was over in that corner,
I was the first City Hall videographer who put on the first Palo Alto City
Council meeting. Since that time, over the 25 years, we have broadcast
30,599 hours of Council meetings and other public meetings for our service
area on our government channels.

Mayor Holman: Thank you.

Ms. Folger: Thank you very much.

Mayor Holman: That's an awful lot of reality TV. Vince is wishing you well
too, back there. Thank you all so very, very much. With that, we move to
Item Number 3.

3.   Selection of Applicants to Interview on September 29, 2015 for the
     Architectural Review Board, the Parks and Recreation Commission, and
     the Planning and Transportation Commission.

Mayor Holman: Council Members, Motions?

Council Member Kniss: Could I ask a question?

Mayor Holman: Of course.

Council Member Kniss: Under Parks and Rec, it appears there are only three
applicants and three openings. Is that correct?

Mayor Holman: That is correct.

Council Member Kniss: Then certainly we should interview all three. It kind
of begs the question of choice.

Mayor Holman: Council Member Kniss, the options are to interview all three.
The options are also—another option is to go out again so that we have not
just an assumption or presumption of selection and to provide a broader
breadth of candidates.

Council Member Kniss: I'll leave that to my colleagues to decide.

Mayor Holman: Council Members?

Council Member Burt: I will move that we reopen the Parks and Rec
application process for what? Another—I don't know what's customary.
Another month, is that what we have done in the past when we extend? Do
you know, David?
