Council Member Schmid: I guess I would like to see another one that has
the level of detail that the Medical Center has.

Mayor Burt: I'm not going to accept that. Vice Mayor Scharff.

Vice Mayor Scharff: After you've gone through, you've hit my questions.
I'm good with the Motion the way it is.

Mayor Burt: Are we good? Anybody else?

Council Member Berman: Is this actually a Motion and a second?

Council Member Kniss: Is there a Motion?

Council Member Berman: I'm not sure.

Mayor Burt: Did I get a second?

Vice Mayor Scharff: I don't think you did.

Council Member Kniss: Yeah, I seconded you.

Mayor Burt: Liz got a second.     We've accepted all of these amendments.
Council Member Wolbach.

Council Member Wolbach: Before we vote, can we actually look at the first
couple of paragraphs of the Motion?

Mayor Burt: Okay.

Council Member Wolbach:        Here's my question.     We really had four
components to our conception of this committee in our Motion back in June,
which were, one, explore priority transportation needs; two, identify funding
requirements; three, explore various funding options; and four, develop a
funding plan. I don't see that reflected exactly here. My question is do we
mean for this to replace or to supplement and still maintain those four
elements?

Mayor Burt: We want to retain them. What do you see missing?

Council Member Wolbach: I think that we've kind of captured the explore
priority transportation needs by talking about reducing vehicle trips and
improving mobility.

Mayor Burt: Don't say what's there. Tell us what's missing.
