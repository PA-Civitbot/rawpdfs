Council Member Klein said that by changing the historic Category, the
applicant received 15,000 square feet of transferable space; he wondered
what the cost was, or what the City received in exchange.

Ms. Gitelman clarified the question was about the applicant fee.

Council Member Klein wanted to know what the benefit to the City was.

Ms. Gitelman answered that the TDR program was initiated to give value to
historic properties so they could be rehabilitated and returned to useful life.
The value of the TDR made the rehabilitation of the Historic Resources more
feasible.

Council Member Klein wanted to know if there was anything in the Report
that required that the applicant make the improvements.

Ms. Gitelman noted that the applicant would only qualify for the TDR’s if
historic rehabilitation was completed to the City’s satisfaction.

Council Member Klein wanted to know if that was a fair trade-off.

Ms. Gitelman noted when the TDR program was instituted, the value of the
TDR’s was thought to be equal to the value of the historic building.

Council Member Klein wondered what problems the applicant would have if
there was no upgrade to the Category of the historic building.

Ms. Gitelman suggested the applicant speak to that.

Council Member Klein wanted to know what restrictions the City placed on
the redevelopment of the property, if it remained in the same Category.

Ms. Gitelman explained the property would continue to conform to the
Secretary of Interior State Standards, but would not receive the benefit of
the TDR’s, which helped finance the historic rehabilitation.

Council Member Klein thought the only exchange for the community was
assisting the developer with his remodel.

Ms. Gitelman noted an incentive was the rehabilitation of a building with the
Secretary of Interior State Standards.
