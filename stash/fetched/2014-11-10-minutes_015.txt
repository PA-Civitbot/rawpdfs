Council Member Scharff would not support the Motion. Perhaps the Council
should refer term limits and requirements for Boards and Commissions to
the Policy and Services Committee. Length of service should be a policy
decision.

Council Member Price would not support the Motion.            The HRB was
composed of talented and committed individuals.

Mayor Shepherd recalled that the Council recently revised the recruitment
process and applications for Boards and Commissions.       She expressed
concern about changing the process without prior notice to candidates and
the public.

James Keene, City Manager, did not believe the Motion contained a time
limit. If the Motion passed, the Council should clearly state that HRB
incumbents would continue to serve.

MOTION FAILED:      3-5 Berman, Klein, Price, Shepherd, Scharff no, Kniss
absent
