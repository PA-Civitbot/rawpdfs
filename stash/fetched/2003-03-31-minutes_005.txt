Mr. Morris said the cost could not yet be determined because it was not
known which parts of the project would be tidal and which were saline
ponds. There was a Federal process for funding flood control through the
Army Corps of Engineers.

Vice Mayor Beecham understood there was a community meeting being
scheduled in Palo Alto.

Mr. Morris said there were three meetings scheduled in the Bay Area for the
coming weeks. The meeting in Palo Alto was scheduled for Wednesday, April
9, 2003, at the Cubberley Community Center, from 9:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m.

Council Member Burch said he was excited to see the restoration project
take place.

Council Member Freeman asked what was the foam that could be seen along
the Dumbarton Bridge.

Mr. Morris said the foam occurred when the high winds whipped up the
water, which was a natural by-product of saline water.

ADJOURNMENT: The meeting adjourned at 7:05 p.m.
