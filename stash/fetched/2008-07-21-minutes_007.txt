13A (Former No. 12.) Approval of a Utilities Enterprise Fund Contract With
     D'Arcy & Harty Construction, Inc. in an Amount Not to Exceed
     1,177,695 dollars for Wastewater Collection System Rehabilitation
     Capital Improvement Program Project WC-06003 Project 19B

Council Member Burt asked if staff had any response to bidders who were
currently questioning the bidding process.

Assistant Director of Administrative Services, David Ramberg stated a bid
protest hearing was held, with the technicality being a form and information
missing for a bidder. However, once this information was received, the
original bid award was upheld and the protest denied.

Council Member Burt asked for further word on this from the City Attorney.

City Attorney, Gary Baum stated extensive review was done, with the City’s
position being legally defensible, with the appropriate actions taken.

Vice Mayor Drekmeier asked why four out of the six applicants did not meet
bidding requirements.

Mr. Ramberg stated they did not look back at the other applicants, since
there was only one protest. They would be double-checking their bid
packages to ensure clear language.

Vice Mayor Drekmeier asked if there was a problem, would there be a new
Request for Proposal.

Mr. Ramberg stated if there was a problem found, the process would
essentially have to restart.

Council Member Burt moved to approve item No. 12.

MOTION: Council Member Burt moved, seconded by Vice Mayor Drekmeier
to approve Staff recommendations to authorize the City Manager or his
designee to execute the contract with D’Arcy & Harty Construction, Inc. in an
amount not to exceed 1,77,695 dollars for Wastewater Collection System
Rehabilitation Capital Improvement Program WC-06003 (WWC Project 19B).
