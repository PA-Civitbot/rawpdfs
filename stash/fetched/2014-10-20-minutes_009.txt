      Totaling $4,395,286 into Capital Improvement Program PE-13016 from
      the El Camino Park Playing Fields and Amenities Project PG-13002
      and from the El Camino Park Expanded Parking Lot and New Restroom
      Project PE-13016, and to Retitle PE-13016 to “El Camino Park

10.   Approval of Contract No. C15155841 With Anderson Pacific
      Engineering Construction, Inc. in the Total Amount Not to Exceed
      $1,067,000 for the Facility Repair & Retrofit Project No. 3 at the

11.   Ordinance 5276 entitled “Establishing Underground Utility District No.
      46 (Arastradero Road/ El Camino Real/ W. Charleston Road) by
      Amending Section 12.16.02 of the Palo Alto Municipal Code (First
      Reading: October 6, 2014 PASSED: 8-0 Klein absent).”

MOTION PASSED for Agenda Item Number 5: 7-2 Holman, Schmid no

MOTION PASSED for Agenda Item Numbers 6-11: 9-0

Council Member Holman referred to the Minutes of the Finance Committee
where the item was barely discussed. Fund 471, the Municipal Services
Center (MSC) Facilities Study, included the Animal Services Center. The
study reviewed options for relocating City functions at the MSC. Those
options did not provide a financial advantage to the City; however, she had
not seen any numbers on that. In December 2014, the Finance Committee
was scheduled to discuss enhancing and/or developing a new Animal
Services Center.

Council Member Schmid noted many things had changed in the past two
years. A public discussion of the item was appropriate.

MOTION TO RECONSIDER: Council Member Scharff moved, seconded by
Council Member Schmid to reconsider the vote on Agenda Item Number 5
and pull this item from the consent calendar.

Molly Stump, City Attorney, reported an item could be reconsidered during
the same meeting if initiated by a Council Member who initially voted in
favor of the item. A second to the Motion was needed.

Mayor Shepherd asked if a Council Member who voted no could second the
Motion.
