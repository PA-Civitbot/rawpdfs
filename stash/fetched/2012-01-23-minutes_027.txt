Ms. French indicated 1880 was AT&T's proposed site and 1920 was the
alternate that was considered feasible.

MOTION: Council Member Schmid moved, seconded by Council Member
XXXX to accept the original Staff recommendation to not include the battery
backup box.

MOTION FAILED FOR LACK OF A SECOND

INCORPORATED INTO THE MOTION WITH THE CONSENT OF THE
MAKER AND SECONDER to amend the language in the Record of Land Use
Action, Section 6-Conditions of Approval, No. 7, that the antenna cabinet
boxes and pole extension shall be painted a matte color matching the
existing color and finish of the utility pole…, with the remainder of No. 7 to
remain the same.

Council Member Holman asked if the FCC rules were different for cellular and
WiFi, as indicated by Mr. Brand.

Mr. Larkin asked for more information.

Council Member Holman asked if the Council was bound by constraints
presented because this was cellular and not WiFi.

Mr. Larkin stated wireless telecommunications were considered under the
Telecommunications Act to have the same status as common carriers. He
indicated the U.S. Supreme Court had said that wireless telecommunication
carriers were to be treated the same as wired telecommunication carriers.
He said the constraints would apply since the proposal involved cellular
service. He explained the Telecommunications Act provisions and California
laws with regard to utility poles and cellular service.

AMENDMENT:         Council Member Holman moved, seconded by Council
Member Burt to exclude 1880 Park Boulevard from the approval and to
direct Staff to investigate alternate locations to meet the service needs of
that cell area.

Council Member Shepherd asked if Staff would have to follow the noticing
process again.

Mr. Williams answered yes.
