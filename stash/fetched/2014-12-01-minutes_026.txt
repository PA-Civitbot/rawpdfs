Public Hearing opened at 11:18 P.M.

Gab Layton felt the City had created a perverse system of incentives that
encouraged traffic and parking issues. The fee charged workers was small,
but it would change the parking situation for residents and business
customers.

Peter Stone did not believe any stakeholder group opposed Phase 1 of the
Residential Parking Permit (RPP) Program. The current parking situation was
difficult for both workers and residents. An RPP Program would be a step
towards active management of the situation.

Brandon Corey preferred residents pay for all permits. A limit of four
permits seemed arbitrary. The proposal did not address people potentially
obtaining four permits and then selling some or all to others. The proposal
should address containment of costs so that permits did not cost $500.

Judy Kleinberg, Chamber of Commerce President and CEO stated the
business community supported Phase 1 of the RPP Program. Employees'
needs should be balanced with residents' needs. Transfer of permits should
to be allowed. Phase 1 should be a pilot program, and it should inform
Phase 2. An RPP Program was only one component of a comprehensive
solution to the parking problem.

Ruth Lowy believed the City should act as the parking problem was
spreading.   The Council needed to ensure that new development was
properly parked.

Public Hearing closed at 11:28 P.M.
