Council Member Burt understood if there was a Matadero Creek Underpass
for bicycles there would be a cost of $1 million. He asked what percentage of
the year it would be able to remain open.

Ms. Ames stated Staff would need to review the creek flow chart to
determine the specifics; however, she felt it would be a seasonal crossing
open approximately six months per year.

Council Member Burt asked why only six months would be available if the
time had been extended for the Adobe Creek.

Ms. Ames said Adobe Creek had been expanded but without completing an
analysis of Matadero Creek she was uncertain of the potential expansion
period.

Council Member Burt asked how many months Adobe Creek had been
expanded.

Mr. Sartor confirmed Adobe Creek had been able to remain open an
additional six weeks in 2011 because there had not been significant rain fall
to date.

Council Member Burt asked for confirmation the intention for Adobe Creek
was to expand the window in late winter and early spring.

Mr. Sartor agreed the goal was to open the pass sooner as weather
permitted.

Council Member Burt asked if the anticipated open season range was from
eight to nine months.

Mr. Sartor felt eight months was an appropriate estimate.

Council Member Klein asked how Staff viewed the practicality of the
Public/Private Partnership ventures and had any other crossing involved
private monies.

Mr. Rodriguez felt there were opportunities to develop Public/Private
Partnerships. It could range from a private development that occurred to
locating public elements for the projects. There were larger employers near
the crossing area that had shown interest in investment possibilities.

Council Member Klein asked if Staff had spoken with Google or other
companies regarding funding assistance.
