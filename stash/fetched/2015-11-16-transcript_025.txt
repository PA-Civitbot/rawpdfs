the Annual Holiday Open House. In addition to meeting artists in their
studios, visitors of all ages will have the opportunity to engage in art making
and participate in hands-on workshops. The Holiday Open House celebration
will feature drop-in tours and special teen MakeX exhibition also curated with
artists. Those of you who walk past Lytton Plaza will see that the holiday
tree is up in Lytton Plaza, yet unlit. The fifth annual Holiday Tree Lighting
will take place on Friday, December 4th, from 4:00 to 7:00 p.m. on Lytton
Plaza. This is always a fun family-centered event. We encourage folks to
come Downtown for that. That's all I have to report.

Mayor Holman: Thank you for all of that.
