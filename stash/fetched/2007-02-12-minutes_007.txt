Flavio Bonomi, 526 Lowell Avenue, referred to Item No. 11 stating the trees
had a negative effect on their property as well as the surrounding neighbors.
The cost to maintain the trees in the past 10 years was approximately
$20,000. He said the ordinance was too drastic, anti-owner, and protected
trees not natural to the area and their maturity and size were hazardous.

Lauren Bonomi, 526 Lowell Avenue, referred to Item No. 11 stating the
ordinance was unfair, and would be quickly processed by tree interest
groups as an immediate reaction of trees being cut down without
understanding why the trees needed to be removed. The trees became too
expensive to maintain and too large for the area and needed to be replaced.

Monica Laurence, 836 East Greenwich Place, spoke of two Redwood trees on
her property and the damage done and the hazardous situation they created
during the last storm. She spoke in support of the Bonomiâ€™s appeal.

Sid Mak, 536 Lowell, spoke of the hazardous situation and safety concerns
