Negative Declaration, and approving the Corridor and Phasing Plans
(Attachment B) for the Charleston/Arastradero Corridor Improvement Plan.

     Resolution 8395 entitled “Resolution of the Council of the City of Palo
     Alto Adopting a Mitigated Negative Declaration Pursuant to the
     California Environmental Quality Act and Approving the Charleston/
     Arastradero Corridor Improvement Plan (02-EIA-16, City of Palo Alto,
     Proponent)”

Council Member Mossar said the trial would commence when the funding
was obtained and would be built soon thereafter. One year after the trial,
the Council and the community would evaluate and decide whether to make
the plan permanent. The motion was asking staff to move forward and
secure funding to have a trial project.

Mr. Emslie said the search for funding would begin when the trial plan was
initiated.

Council Member Morton said the immediate benefit was that Council would
be taking a first step to correct a problem.

Council Member Ojakian asked about the timeframe of the turn lanes at
Gunn High School.

Mr. Emslie said the turn lanes were easy fixes and could be accomplished
expeditiously.

Council Member Ojakian said he understood the traffic adaptive traffic signal
operations would be completed second.

Mr. Emslie said the Council had approved and submitted a grant application
to the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA), which addressed
all five residential corridors with traffic adaptive.

Council Member Ojakian wanted confirmation the impact would be measured
when the new signal was installed.

Mr. Emslie said the success would be measured.

Council Member Ojakian said changes would be phased in and the results
would be seen over a period of time. Selected areas of the 2.3 miles would
reduce to three lanes.

Mr. Emslie confirmed 50 percent of the roadway would remain four lanes.
