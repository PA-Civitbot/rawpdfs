Mayor Holman: I think you have numerous seconds. I think I heard Council
Member Scharff second it first, I believe.

MOTION:           Council Member Burt moved, seconded by Council Member
Scharff to:

A.         Have the Mayor reappoint the City Council Rail Committee; and

B.         Direct Staff to return in the near future with a preliminary plan for a
           Context Sensitive Solution (CSS) approach to address rail impacts and
           the future of rail in Palo Alto; and

C.         Direct Staff to return with a first phase Circulation Study; and

D.         Direct Staff and the Mayor representing the Council to convey, clearly
           to both the California High Speed Rail Authority and Caltrain:

     i.          The full Context Sensitive Solutions approach should be retained
                 for the process of High Speed Rail along the Peninsula; and

     ii.         The timeline for the Environmental Impact Report (EIR) along
                 the Peninsula should be adjusted to include adequate timing for
                 the EIR and adjusted for time needed to fully integrate CSS in
                 the process.

Mayor Holman:          Council Member Burt, would you care to speak to your
motion?

Council Member Burt: I've really spoken to most of it already. I would say
the only other thing that I want to add, but I didn't want to have it as a
directive of the motion, is that as the Mayor spoke about the challenges of
having VTA partner with the North County cities and other collaboration
challenges, we're going to really need to engage with our elected officials at
the State and County level. Assembly Member Gordon and State Senator
Hill as well as County Supervisor Simitian who represents us and has a great
deal of experience with this issue, we need to ask them to re-engage on this
just as we're re-engaging and to come and have support, and also to have
them beâ€”I'm sorry, I'm not asking for this part to be in the motion. Have
them really help pull together a collaboration of cities on the Peninsula.

Mayor Holman: Council Member Scharff, care to speak to your second?

Council Member Scharff: Yes, just briefly. I think this basically captures
what we discussed as a Council, and I think it captures it well. I guess the
only other thing I would say is I do think this is going to be a long slog, and
it's going to take intense focus. That's why I'm really glad that we're
                                                                               Page 34 of 70
