Council Member Espinosa said there would not be a long delay factor since a
buffer was built in to the timeline. The Council was not approving a different
design but reevaluating the design. He encouraged the Council to look at
the big picture and that the focus was on a small size space. If the offices
and conference room and portions of the workspace were to move to
another location, the entire administrative space would be designed to make
the library more inviting and having the capability to increase the collection
making it a real library.

Mayor Drekmeier supported the idea of increased collection at the Downtown
Library but did not support the Amendment. He supported the main Motion.
