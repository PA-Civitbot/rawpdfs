ORAL COMMUNICATIONS

Clayborne Carson, Director of the Martin Luther King, Jr. Research and
Education Institute, announced a partnership with the City to commemorate
the 50th Anniversary of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom on
August 26, 2013 at 5:00 P.M.

Palo Alto Free Press felt the Human Relations Commission (HRC) was not
involved in the vehicle habitation issue. He wanted to know why the Council
did not question the HRC's lack of involvement.

Paul Mitchell opposed the plan to close the showers at Cubberley Community
Center. The showers at The Opportunity Center were metered, did not
function properly, and were insufficient in number.

Herb Borock understood Ms. Antil's comment to indicate the stockpiling of
soil at the Golf Course was part of the San Francisquito Creek Joint Powers
Authority (JPA) Environmental Impact Report (EIR). The Council would have
to approve the EIR prior to removal of the 90 trees at the Golf Course. He
could not recall if the Council approved the EIR.

Grover Amos thanked the Council for providing a forum regarding local
issues.

Stephanie Munoz congratulated the Council on expanding the role of the
Sister City Program. Palo Alto needed public showers to be a world class
power.

AJ reused paper bags from grocery stores to hold recyclables.         Because
paper bags were no longer free, he could no longer recycle.

Barbara Slone proposed that Taunggyi, Myanmar, be considered as a Sister
City.
