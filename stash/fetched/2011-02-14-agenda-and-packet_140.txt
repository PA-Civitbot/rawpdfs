Approximately a dozen e-mails in support of the project were directed to the PTC in advance of
the meeting.

The Commission discussed the possible intensification of uses on the street from future
development and the ability of two lanes to accommodate the increased traffic. Staff indicated
that considerable traffic capacity is available with the two lane configuration. The Commission
also had several questions regarding elements of the project that address the functionality of
the street, e.g., loading zones and raised mid-block crosswalks. Staff explained the general
concepts for the design of the streetscape, and noted that those components would be further
discussed with the public during a series of community meetings over the next year and a final
design would be reviewed by the ARB and PTC before Council action early next year. The
Commission also had questions regarding the economic effects the improvements to the street
would have on businesses in the area. Staff responded that two elements of the plan are critical
from an economic development perspective—added parking and creating sense of place.

Resource Impact
The engineer’s estimate for the cost of the California Avenue – Transit Hub Corridor
Improvements Project is $1,725,200. The City received a grant from the VTA CDT Program in
the amount of $1,175,200, which becomes available to the City for use in February 2012. A
$550,000 local match from the Infrastructure Reserve Account will be required as part of the
grant requirements.

Staff impacts will be incurred in the amount of time spent to manage and coordinate the hiring
of a design consultant and management of the consultant’s work during 2011, attendance at
public hearings and preparation of staff reports, and management of bid procurement and
project construction in 2012. The Planning and Community Environment Department will lead
the design effort, with assistance from Public Works, which would then provide construction
oversight in 2012. Purchasing staff in Administrative Services would also be involved at various
stages to assist with soliciting and administering contracts for design and construction.
Cumulatively, staff estimates a staff effort equivalent to 0.25 FTE of a professional position
would be devoted to the project over a 2-year period.
