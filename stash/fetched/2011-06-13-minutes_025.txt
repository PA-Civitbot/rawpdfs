Council Member Klein asked if there was an appropriate number of parking
spaces in that area.

Mr. Snyder said the area had several constraints and tree preservation
issues. The biggest issue was a slope near the bus turn-around area. There
would be approximately 20-25 spaces depending on Caltran’s permission,
signal timing and accessibility.

Council Member Klein asked if the Olympic Memorial trees located at the
southwest corner would remain as is.

Mr. Snyder said every effort would be made to preserve the trees.

Council Member Klein asked where the dog park would be located.

Mr. Snyder referred to a wall map and pointed to the area where the dog
park area could be fenced off.

Council Member Klein asked how definite the dog park was in the plan.

Mr. Anderson said the dog park was not definite at this time. The area was
intended to be a passive recreation area. Issues and options needed to be
studied during the conceptual phase.

Council Member Klein said this was not a topic of discussion for this evenings
meeting and asked Staff to see about changing the name Stanford/Palo Alto
Soccer Facilities to differentiate the facility’s location.

Council Member Shepherd asked if a fence was planned along Alma Street
across from El Palo Alto.

Mr. Snyder made reference to the wall map and indicated there was an
existing fence in an internal area with shorter fencing for the dog park and
would not limit access to the park.

Council Member Shepherd had issues on voting on an area with only the
possibility for parking. She asked if there was an inventive way to create a
pathway from the Red Cross building or the transit center to access the
area.

Mr. Snyder asked as an engineer or a person in a truck.

Council Member Shepherd said a person in a truck.
