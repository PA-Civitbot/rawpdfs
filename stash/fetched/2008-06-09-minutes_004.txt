SPECIAL ORDERS OF THE DAY

2.    Appointment of Four Candidates to the Public Art Commission for
      Three Year Terms Ending April 30, 2011.

Council Member Morton suggested waiting to vote on the candidates due to
an additional vacancy.

MOTION: Council Member Morton moved, seconded by Mayor Klein to
defer the vote for appointment of the four candidates until after the
interviews for the vacancy for the unexpired term currently recruited for.

Council Member Kishimoto supported the Motion and spoke to the
qualifications of the applicants as “professional artists” as stated in the
Charter.

Council Member Morton stated recent recruitments had been low and felt
more time may produce a greater number of applicants.

Council Member Barton supported the Motion since it did not interfere with
the Commission meetings.

Interim Deputy City Manager Kelly Morariu stated two Commissioners had
volunteered to continue to serve until their positions were filled.

Council Member Burt supported the Motion.

Council Member Kishimoto requested clarification on the notification of
qualifications received by the applicants.
City Clerk Donna Grider stated the application packet contained the required
information.

Council Member Kishimoto asked for clarification on the delay of the
appointments.

Ms. Grider stated due to the unexpected resignation of Paula Kirkeby the
suggestion was to allow for the completion of the recruitment and appoint all
five positions at the same time.
