Mayor Burt stated the City Council would now discuss the HSR Corridor
Study. He restated Council Member Klein’s comments regarding passing a
Motion preceding a policy discussion by the HSR Committee. He indicated it
was unusual to have a budget allocation before consideration of a policy.

issue. The Motion could be contingent upon review and recommendation by
the HSR Committee.
