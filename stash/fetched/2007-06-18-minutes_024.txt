Mr. Mazer stated the goal was to take the parameters the City had set and
work with those to create an optimal financial package.

Mayor Kishimoto asked the goal of the City was to limit the impact on the
General Fund and to come back with a business plan that would fit.

Mr. Mazer stated their goal was to have a program the City was comfortable
with and would sign off on.

Council Member Cordell asked what the status of the work was that they
were doing in Franklin County and Pasco.

Mr. Mazer stated that 180 Connect was the lead participant in that project.

Council Member Cordell asked whether he was involved in that project.

Mr. Mazer replied he was but Mr. Jones would be able to give a fuller
answer.

Council Member Cordell asked whether he knew the status.

Mr. Mazer stated the status was in the final contract phase.

Council Member Cordell asked whether he had worked on a project for a city
where they had provided Ultra High Speed Broadband System without
getting guarantees or cash from the city.

Mr. Mazer replied no.

Council Member Cordell asked whether it was likely in the project in Franklin
County that there would be cash of some kind to make that project happen.

Mr. Mazer stated Franklin County was different in that the public utilities
were involved in the project and the community was making the contribution
of Automated Meter Readings (AMR).

Council Member Cordell stated she wanted to know how realistic this was
with the Council not wanting to give guarantees.

Mr. Mazer stated in every project that involved outside financing the Capital
Market makes the final determination. They wanted to push the decision
process to an earlier stage to access the contributions and the financial
package to get an early answer from the Capital Market. They wanted to
limit the risk for Palo Alto with this project by taking the financial plan at an
early stage.
