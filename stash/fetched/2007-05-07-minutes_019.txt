their Tasers.

Ms. Johnson replied it would be the individual officer’s decision and that is
why there would be decision-making as part of the training.

Council Member Morton asked if there might be a time where a Taser would
save someone’s life versus being killed by a gun.

Ms. Johnson stated there are workers’ compensation claims where officers
attempted to arrest and subdue a person who is violent and, in return, have
been bitten or fell and hurt themselves. In this type of situation, a Taser
would be used.

Council Member Morton stated his concern was for the community at large
and this would be a more humane way to handle a situation.

Ms. Johnson stated in most cases, thousands of people’s lives have been
saved by the use of Tasers. Ms. Johnson stated the media does not cover
those types of situations. However, speaking to colleagues across the
countries that have used Tasers, they have had no deaths and no serious
injuries.

Council Member Cordell asked for clarification if a shoplifter became
aggressive wouldn’t it be appropriate for the officer to pull a gun and use
lethal force.

Ms. Johnson stated she was correct.

Council Member Cordell asked whether it would be appropriate under the
policy envisioned for the City to use Tasers.

Ms. Johnson stated given the right circumstances that would be appropriate.

Council Member Cordell asked if the policy stated Tasers could only be used
where lethal force would be permitted, what would the officer do with the
person in this situation.

Ms. Johnson stated the officer would have to go hands on with the person.

Council Member Cordell asked whether it would be with pepper spray and
batons.

Ms. Johnson stated possibly.
