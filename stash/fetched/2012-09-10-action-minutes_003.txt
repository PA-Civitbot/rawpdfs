Members were split over the need to reduce the height of the buildings, while
most expressed the need for additional setbacks from any residential uses.
The Council offered other types of public benefits that the applicant may wish
to include in their proposal, such as bike sharing, a pedestrian bridge across
the railroad tracks to Alma, and/or full financing of the public safety building.
The Council asked staff to further define the project’s conformance with the
California Avenue Concept Plan, while moving the project moving forward in a
timely fashion.
