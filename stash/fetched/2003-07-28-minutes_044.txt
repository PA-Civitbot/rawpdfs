Council Member Kleinberg asked about an incremental decreasing
housing cap on Alma Street regarding the noise and the transit.

Mr. Emslie said one reason was to mask the density as close to the
transit as possible so it was convenient and could be used by future
residents. Larger buildings provided sound attenuation for the
neighborhoods that were East of Alma Street. Alma Place was a
similar comparison.

Council Member Kleinberg asked whether the RT-50 could be cut in
half along Alma Street.

Mr. Emslie said the P&TC addressed that through the FAR and the
daylight plane. The requirements for transition and separation between
zoning districts RT-50 and RT-35 related to the height and daylight
plane.

Council Member Kleinberg asked whether the Sofa 2 area could have a
4.0 FAR limit and the remainder a 2.0 FAR.

Mr. Emslie said how the building related to the street was important in
addition to the height and the setback.

Council Member Kleinberg said a variety of housing was needed . It
was best to allow the bonus in a PC for affordable housing and not
build BMR housing.

Mr. Emslie said the concept was to transition from Alma Street, and
that would be done through both the FAR and requirement for daylight
plane and height variation.

Council Member Kleinberg suggested not going to a 4.0 FAR, which
was closer to the Central business district. She asked staff to make
some suggestions to lessen the rest of Alma Street instead of a 4.0
FAR.

Council Member Kishimoto said the direction was a RT-50 PC. It did
not limit the RT area.

Council Member Burch said the Council needed to do what the public
deserved
