                                                                                                                10.d




 1   trying to comply with our own City standards regarding parking dimensions and parking depths
 2   and widths.

 4   One of the changes that I should note that we did make in this plan very early on as a result of




                                                                                                                       Attachment: Attachment D: P&TC Excerpt Minutes of January 12, 2011 (1320 : California Avenue Neg Dec and CIP)
 5   some of the community input was we originally had an eight foot wide parking ________ to
 6   maximize it even more. Much of the community said that is too narrow, go at least eight and
 7   half. That is how we got to where we did. So when Hexagon didn’t specifically look at is 45
 8   better than 60 throughout the corridor because we complied with our City standards. They
 9   looked at 45 from the standpoint of where don’t you comply with City standards if you do 60,
10   and that is how the recommendations came up to make those changes down near Park Boulevard
11   East and Park Boulevard West, as long as the one area for the optional plaza near Ash Street.

13   Commissioner Keller: Is there currently a speeding problem on this segment of California
14   Avenue? What would be the effect of the traffic speeds of changing to this configuration?
15
16   Mr. Rodriguez: That is a really good question and I am going to go off memory here. No, there
17   is not speeding problem. Most of the data that we collected shows speeds anywhere between 20
18   to 25 miles per hour. So speeding was not so much an issue. One of the reasons why this project
19   recommended the raised mid-block crosswalks that are shown in the plan is because narrowing
20   down to one lane, which is a little bit more wider, more comfortable for traveling and sharing
21   between a vehicle and a bicyclist we didn’t want it to result in a speed increase either. So those
22   mid-block speed table will help to make sure that that issue is addressed. We wanted to make
23   sure we planned versus react with this project. That is how the recommendation was made.

25   Commissioner Keller: Thank you. Was there conversations with the farmer’s market and
26   festivals that are there like the To Life Festival and the impact of what is being proposed on
27   these?
28
29   Mr. Rodriguez: We never specifically outreached to say the farmer’s market association other
30   than we wanted to plan for trying to enhance that facility by introducing the concept of that plaza
31   near Ash Street.
32
33   One of the things we threw out to the community, but it wasn’t well received, was we thought
34   maybe we could look at doing a weekend long closure, Friday night to Sunday morning. But it
35   was not well received so it was not studied as part of the traffic analysis.
36
37   Commissioner Keller: Thank you. I have seen loading the median in California Avenue by
38   Birch. I have seen in the evening a truck adjacent to that in the eastbound direction leaving the
39   right lane free in order to use that as a loading zone if you will. This is like nine or ten o’clock at
40   night. I am wondering what they are loading to but I notice the truck there occasionally. Do you
41   know what the effect would be on that of this proposal, and are you aware that that’s
42   occasionally used as an impromptu loading zone?
43
44   Mr. Rodriguez: That is a really good question. It is actually something that we discussed with
45   both the business community as well as the regular community during all the meeting processes
46   we had in September and August. We actually introduced two loading zones within this project
