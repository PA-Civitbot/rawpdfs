and to reduce the contract amendment for Mid-Year Check-ins with Sherry L.
Lund and Associates by $900.

Council Member Scharff agreed the mid-year check for the City Clerk was
unnecessary. With the possibility of a new hire for the City Auditor position,
he felt this mid-year check was necessary.

Council Member Burt asked when the mid-year check would take place.

Ms. Lund noted this occurred in December or January, depending on
Council’s schedule.

Council Member Burt asked, in the hiring process of the City Auditor, to what
degree were they defining goals as part of the process.

Ms. Lund stated she was not aware of the conversations with the recruiters.
Setting goals after the person came on board was usually a different goal-
setting process.

Council Member Holman concurred with Ms. Lund.

AMENDMENT:      Council Member Holman moved, seconded by Council
Member XXX to add $4,550 to the Council budget to do the Mid-Year Check-
ins.

AMENDMENT FAILED DUE TO THE LACK OF A SECOND

Council Member Scharff asked if the original Motion for the annual reviews
contained a reduction of $1500 less if completed by August.

Council Member Holman stated the discount still applied.

Council Member Schmid asked if the funding for the mid-year check-ins was
added to the budget from the Council Contingency or added to the 2012
Annual Budget.

Ms. Grider stated funds would need to come from the Budget Stabilization
Fund or the Council Contingency.

Council Member Holman stated the amount was $4950 without the Clerk’s
mid-year check. It was then subject to further reductions if the Council
Members met their deadlines for CAO evaluations.

Council Member Scharff stated he would rather they all meet the deadline in
order to lower the amount.
