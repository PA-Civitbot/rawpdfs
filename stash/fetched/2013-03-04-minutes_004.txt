SPECIAL ORDERS OF THE DAY

2.   Abilities United     for   a   Public/Private   Community   Partnership
     Presentation.

The Betty Wright Swim Center, as part of Abilities United, originated as a
public/private partnership in the 1960s, and had strong partnerships with
organizations in San Mateo and Santa Clara Counties. Abilities United
serviced people from 6 months to 100 years of age. He welcomed everyone
to an open house on March 27, 2013 from 6:00 P.M. to 9:00 P.M. The Betty
Wright Swim Center was the first indoor therapeutic center in the western
U.S.A., and the innovator of a new therapy for people with neuro-
degenerative conditions. The City of Palo Alto contributed 3 percent to the
operating budget. The Betty Wright Swim Center was not large enough to
handle the number of participants. He proposed an integrative wellness
center to house all leading tertiary care and wellness organizations in Palo
Alto.

Council Member Kniss indicated the program was known throughout the
County, especially for its hydrotherapy facilities. The program managed its
expenses well. Palo Alto was proud to have the facility.
