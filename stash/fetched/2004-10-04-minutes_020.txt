serviced by a variety of transportation modes.‚Äù The recurring theme of the
ZOU was to implement the Comp Plan.

AMENDMENT: Council Member Kishimoto moved, seconded by Freeman, to
direct staff when item returned, to bring back the design guidelines or other
regulations to add bicycle, pedestrian, and transit facilities to make the
Research Park multi-modal and implement Comprehensive Plan policies L-
42, L-43 and L-44.

Mr. Emslie said staff constantly looked at ways of promoting transit use in
the Research Park. There was information that might be beneficial in
evaluating recommendations that staff brought back to the Council. Staff
believed information could be brought back to the Council in a timely
manner.

Council Member Freeman clarified the motion was suggestive of what might
happen in the Stanford Research Park and did not necessarily regulate
Stanford at the current time to do anything that would monetarily influence
its building.

Mr. Emslie said that was correct.

Council Member Freeman said the document helped the Council in the
future.

Mr. Baum said a motion to amend an amendment was in order but to amend
an amendment to an amendment was not.

Mayor Beecham said the motion was to amend a substitute motion.

SUBSTITUTE MOTION PASSED AS AMENDED 6-1, Kishimoto no.

MOTION: Council Member Kishimoto moved, seconded by Freeman, to
direct staff to bring back design guidelines or other regulations to add
bicycle, pedestrian, and transit facilities to make the Stanford Research Park
multi-modal and to implement Comp Plan policies L-42, L-43 and L-44.

Council Member Kleinberg supported the policies but was concerned about
the creation of bicycle and pedestrian paths for people to multi-modal with
no particular place to go.

Council Member Ojakian clarified staff dealt with transportation through the
Mayfield agreement.
