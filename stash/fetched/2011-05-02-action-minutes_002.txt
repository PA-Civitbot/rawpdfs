STUDY SESSION

2.   Public Safety Systems Virtual Consolidation Project.

The abbreviated study session on the virtual consolidation of dispatch
systems between Palo Alto, Mountain View, and Los Altos provided Council
with updated information on the project. A CAD vendor has been selected
and final negotiations are underway with Intergraph Corporation. The
project has three components, the public safety applications including CAD
and RMS, the 9-1-1 phone system and radio communications. Consolidation
of the applications on a common network is well underway with CAD
implementation projected to complete in the second quarter of 2012. The
9-1-1 phone system replacement will occur in 2012 and is funded by the
State. A common radio channel has been identified and licensed with the
FCC. Grant funding has been secured to build out the channel with
estimated completion in late 2012.
