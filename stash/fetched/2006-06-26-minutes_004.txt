student film and requested a waiver of the permit.

Mayor Kleinberg said the film was being produced under a corporate
partnership and permit fees could not be waived.

City Attorney Gary Baum said the film was put together by a for-profit
corporation and not consistent with City policies. However, the Council
could make the final decision.

Mayor Kleinberg asked the City Attorney whether the Council could
issue a one-time waiver.

Mr. Baum said issuing a one-time waiver to a for-profit corporation
could set precedence for issuing waivers to all for-profit organizations
in the future.
