REPORTS OF OFFICIALS

9A.   (Old No. 11) Adopt Council “Top 4” Priorities and Milestones for 2007:
      Emergency Planning; Global Climate Change; Library Plan/Public Safety
      Building; and Sustainable Budget

City Manager Benest said the “Top 4” priorities and milestones had been
identified and required Council approval to move forward in accomplishing the
priorities.

MOTION: Council Member Kleinberg moved, seconded by Klein, to adopt the
2007 Council Top 4 Priorities and milestones as identified, with a change in
wording from “global climate change” to “climate protection” and with one
addition to Milestone No. 11, Transportation, to add the following: (e) Explore
joint alternative transportation projects.

Council Member Kleinberg asked for a definition of “sustainable budget.”

Vice Mayor Klein said it meant having to establish and adopt a budget process
to include infrastructure, community, and City staffing needs in order to keep
the City in excellent condition for the next five to twenty years.

Council Member Morton said the community was not clear on what was being
sustained. They were under the impression that balancing the budget meant a
decrease in services and social and community programs were at risk of not
getting funded.

Mayor Kishimoto asked to add “to explore joint alternative transportation
projects” to Milestone No. 11, Transportation.

MOTION PASSED 9-0.
